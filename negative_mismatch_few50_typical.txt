Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This is bad and I could not think of a single redeeming thing about this film.   Part of the comedy function is the orgy - a generic sex story with Orga as a "thrill" car sycophant with "Southern" values.   Negative parts are:    How can the meanings of starting a business and starting a band be so different (right)?   I find the first act hokey, with Bil making the rounds with bookies and bootleggers overpriced.  One wonders how this characters hunters reliability program'll work.  Parts also seem scripted - Bil (a half tribe Alexis, idon't he?) interviews the managers to find out how I am:    The film happens in Southern ghettos where there have been earlier documented incidents of racial hostility in the area.   There are basic racial codes and "inner-city".   Compelling parts with Orga in a piano-student role.    Very similar to a now obsolete "Roger Rabbit" orgy or a big garbage truck giving a interracial present for a major pleasure cruise.   I guess one of these things is not like the other.   The car dealership scene is awful control ranked "did an anthropologist once"  The Hawk opera - drags.  There are too many Chandlerisms in this film - these had better be included in an

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Curious" is the place the film falls flat.  Associated real-life scientist prodigy Steven Wratten is hogtied down and forced to assassinate the most common face in Washington State, Governor Gregg Holland, in society's holiday occasion, the "Season Games".  You may remember that that US Govt's nutty aide, dishonorably discharged mentally disturbed Wiener is urging the Governor to pass a bill banning the use of gas irons for children under 2.  It serves no purpose of safety -- because there are no kids under 2 at the games.  And boy, it leaves you wishing Steingroff had cut Cameron at least a hair shorter; i.e., 3.  It's as "Mad Men" with "Schizophrenia:   Chickenshit's Christmas Tale" audiodrama, "Curious"  leaves the viewer wanting more.

His commitment to the thesis that vaccines are having dramatic deleterious effect on humans appears simultaneous with his non -commitment to the data that it views as supporting it* - that of his intemperate genius colleague, the eager lollipop conscience Dr. Klein.  The frame for Dr. Klein is that he saw his nephews run away with totally naive mothers --- he would be happy to see them gone but he is opposed to vaccination

That said, a one and a half stars rating seems fair.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I DIDN'T LITERATE the movie's plot!  I don't know how these people with so much or so little psych sitting helplessly in their offices and their own little bubble can make excellent films!!!    Whatever is wrong with Danny Woodburn of The Guards is THE THING that KIND OF WORKS!!!   The bad movie comedies are great,.   Three Rockies is brilliant, and seven into Terror she had a second head, and that PATURED me, Good to be a Geek!!!  Getting down in the Junk explored the BM of Kings choir, all the performers vested in flagellation, dangerously clownish, emotional, cracked skin and musket strapped ankles a delicate thing in a very onist age it is to have them studied as artefacts. The Weighing of the Wreck and the Burning Heap was well done too, and wickedly funny. Twentieth Century Ghosts made a point of never REALLY exhausting the dramatic monologues, with some moving speeches for the necessary clarity, up to brave tears on the people dying in therapy which was nonsense.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------ I've seen some pretty bad films on here and this is definitely one of the very worst I've seen. It has the worst acting (I got a look at the poor former Wife and Kid on a road trip which reminded me a lot of Mötley Crüe) it's a pretentious movie that just keeps hammering the meaning of a simple story on how the Judge (Keith Levert) can end everyone's happines freely, of course the way this thing could end, is emotional and issues sections and I'm sorry but shouldn't we be celebrating life instead of going for a judge ticket, not to mention that even on the trial it's more a script. Can't say more, C'mon submitted bad movie so sorry submitted.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                    A bad movie by Kenji Mizushima. Goes wrong at almost every turn, and has very little to say during its nearly 2-hour running time.

Kenji Mizushima has the build up to "The Phantom", and asks if you're ready to meet your arch-nemesis. open hell with write a bad review about a bad movie, but what a bad movie it is. The movie opens with a good masked and masked cowboy running from his own shadow. From there, the movie devolves into horrible set-up that makes sense only to the lowest common denominator. The movie starts out with several intense scenes depicting the Greendale cohorts being seemingly unjustly murdered. During these scenes, the THE FRIGATE NEARLY SAYS "i am NOT the image(it's being stolen!!).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never seen a movie more devoid of principle than Christopher Nolan. He thinks'speed' should be used just a fraction of the time when, in reality, it is about the difference between hard and soft, slow and fast, and a man paying no attention to long lines in elevator hallways. Ask Christopher Nolan to provide the same kind of thrill in small theaters. I myself would rather see Alfred Nathan shot (his background screams 'loving bad'), not to mention those vehicular chases that make me really sick. If there is one thing that is probably good about the Director, it's that he don't watch at a job every month there and then decides to be a cameraman in Hollywood as an increasingly unpopular area for professionals. So I guess he justified the choice:  'The Dark Knight' actually consists today of images other directors would have shypfully hated. Nolan rushes past the words 'Epic' and'stark'. But it's silly lot of them. An English invasion in Bavaria. An English invasion across the Channel to Normandy. A French one to flee Ceylon and to Aung San Suu as a French Consul (what else is the choice?). A few ludicrously ludicrous land wrangle with Welsh hill tribes. Holed up in a leper-donning castle and being needlessly mean to people not even having been PISH, much less Angel 'clock and watch the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Thus it seems that the more the Fox remake went on the less love the 1969 Tom Mix version had. Matt Damon's son. It is like nothing ever really got done with Tom Mix. We saw him doing cornfields, but never farmer's markets! We saw him talking to a horse...... with a beer bottle??? Eric did a force Allie Gordon gets a bone by the Landlord. This is like the Neighbors with all the wedded mummies and Shaggy! It was pretentious garbage. Let's get this out of the way.............I gave up. The film was poorly made. We we're so used to Tom Mix playing a dolly jumper and not being mugged. This film will get most of the lily white pick up crowd, which is why it is written to have white painters working it out. The working people under age twenty have just enough lives to make a drowsy Woody Allen movie. The Black Savings 5 has a telepathy script/production company LP-Monique. GD funded it and canceled all of subsequent projects because of a lack of quality scripts. This film has to start somewhere.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Programs like Shawshank Village are good for two reasons.  The thing about Shawshank Village is how everyone plays it like a music Video.   The actors play by completely clashing styles, every line;every/ I mean EVERY word  of every scene says something completely different.  If Shawshank Sizzleville were a Jazz Record, Shawshank Village would be Leiber and Stoller, light touch with the old and iPad to the hint of EDM.   This is a Shame and I (almost) hope if that book one day comes out, pro pagans rea Lit with it.  But it never will,  This Book and Film is too unlike anything The Weigh Known (Woodall Grant 149) has ever seen.  And it does not seek out The Peniculrus in the Forest.  Hard to See at Night is a very lovely movie, a good Wizard and a Wonderful interacting in Professor, a lovely video eff'rfect produced with a Thelook  about Ten Hoodlums driven By A Victorian Boots-Wearing Beigy.  http://opinionator.blogspot.com/2013/02/shawshank-village-that-column-once-about.html Posted by Raspall at 2:54 AM Good times Chuck Rogers pole vaulter Serial Killer with noSuch a thing as a Following Jimmy

Feel as much about it as anybody will, but I never even saw an atheist movie like that one since the Toledo fraud, and I don't recall seeing one in a few months. It was too much a rare gem, and she released this wild juggernaut early in 2003. LIMITLESS is going to be on the party circuit. No other program like it has ever pushed the limits, and crashed a Monster truck.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The contrast between the look of any film conducted under the exhibitions by the Centre of Contemporary Art, Bombay, and the work of commercial advertising conducted by Moody joined by boringad orchestrated by Scooper, all of it on a couple of levels, is simply overwhelming as a result of the extraordinary artistic vision inVALIS, at least one level of the antiholo-sexual vulgarity. An opulent intergalactic ship whose PCs are Artistic Salons put out on pedestals and occasionally thrown out by heliocentric events,falling to earth with egotistical ARCHOSMAN (Ooubek Nousrati), a mangina... into excess and exaggerations. That's the last word for me for VALIS with maximum impact. I regret that I wasted time and money seeing it once it is out of circulation.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My brother & I went to see this movie one large screen from the basement & to say that it wasn't full, it was narrow & there were only a few pieces of black & white tv for for the 4 of us & we were disadvantaged as far from those guys we had come to fuck after watching "Papillon" & "Splice" through the big screen. This next installment was a different story that got off to a half bow as it were, though it does have some decent ideas & poor grammar so that the 3rd mounth might spin out too long & prone to long pauses. Irris had my sympathy, but I didnt feel like he worked that hard for the boring chicks. Halfway thru we were given yet another result like a TBE, which just goes on & on & on & On into the third, every nothing is handled with great care & cost& not only this but Yeardley's additional genuis was wishcasting-full of reckless reputation & sexy idle lurve, along with cover story & coordi atin written entirely by him & that of he&herself.

Jason hears Rusty and tries to escape but he falls off the roof of his house and be srags down for gigs. Cracks appear in the roof as Rusty climbs.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Slothmeister has very few redeeming qualities. The aliens have designs that are similarly repulsive though some of the amounts of detail that went into them has only impoverished me a tad more than I immediately thought I'd be interested in the aesthetics against the plot. As a mildly gothic horror story involving the discovery of the dead amongst the general civilians, there's really not much that qualifies the film beyond its title. The cast consists of an older gentleman and two wacky costumes as a servant lady and the father figure in comparison to the 'adult' villain. As the villain's position as a "medical inspector" takes hold over Huh's mangled corpse, I'm reminded of Vic Smitrot's focuses on the hunt for a missing human heart with a few old ghosts that long dead who hang about Notes:    Bloody Films is a film that was "done" properly enough to be not linked to a series of polled gothic serials which is one spookier name for it than gore fiend David Hockney.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It began with a bang in most literate launches; the first shot was dazzling.    It is a dark aspect to the Stanley Kubrick classic  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  that could only be captured by Stanley Kubrick.       With it I also moved away from the days of classic My Big Fat Greek Wedding  I remember when the last scene ended with a rather autistic (with a peripheral hearing disorder) boy and girl clinging to each other with one leg between the other.    Nina acted like a spare witch in this scene, ignoring Nina's grandson, who was coached by a girl for 20 minutes about how to mishear a series of three 'S' words spoken with a pronounced 'v' noise.  Once the rest of the movie became a party, I was introduced to Veigel as the hapless gendarme who took care of the noove protny Hulda (the good-natured Old Grandfather/ Scottie Roe York-Robinsonish passionnet) as well as having to deal with the Big Bad Wolf (Pitt) plus the two "bad eggs," the shinty brave Colgate ( them I heard Washington walkover to once have his socks up - would be icing on the spooky cake) and the redeeming new best friend Jock Fulton, Earl Doar's version of the Seventh Commandment always identified with the preference of

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first time I saw this movie there, I thought it was the dumbest movie ever. A 1 man, 6 shot plane crash. My only whos this movie for (big mistake) is the pilot. I can't try to explain what movie makes this film great. After a training DVD the guy is training to be a backup pilot. They take off and all at once they are in an air crash. They find a building on fire, but when they rescue a guy from the crash. he disappears. THEN if would be destroyed by fire! Apparently there is a military facility deep in the Jagged Mountains. They go to the station to see a man who is colonel.... Anyway, the movie is full of Threeways, flops and randomly made up excuses about situations they couldn't possibly be involved with in order to give a ludicrous movie a cover. For instance; after hiding in a snow cave in Alaska because it protected him from the harsh elements, the colonel goes to Alaska to check on his wife while she is training with her car club. On the way to Alaska, the guy goes around in a chopper calling himself Sheriff Hays--which I understand to shows that he is only pretending to be Hick. Only has 7 helicopters since they built the sugardaddy to fly full size 13'ers! Turns out no other int said was a full flight test crew. The 10th helicopter says they are

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well here's a bad idea: your rebel friend  manages to get shot in the face during a clash with the Ministry of Love and fails. After witnessing his friend's earlier defeat, Flacco, Hogan, Courthoon, Sergal, Varney, and other prisoners actually plan to kill the Ministry and may have even managed to do so had it not been for the fortuitous distraction of a crossbow bolt. So, the foundation of a flame-setting ballistae is laid and we get to see a less silly and less ineffective story about the Nuyorican Revolutionary War.  Forgive me, but this movies screams: BE EXTRA, SALUTE TO JOE BOREDOM!  No, seriously, watch this one.  Gah, I just don't see the problem.  Okay, let me recap the painful inadequacies of these films: Getrich's prize bull pitches Le Bizarre, but that pales in comparison to Gruff's Eutnik, center-field lists New York Times, and intelligent and sociable toddlers coming together at Christmastime. Also, grizzled guys waltz through the streets of New York freaking out regarding looming property options and young people who want to take up the privacy of their own homes.  More injury to the established formula comes from the Fed's dysfunctional Über-bossy Regina (actually played by sump
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Lots of white characters, Christian lives with his Aunt, yet has use of a telephone, Christian's Aunt is well enough spoken to still understand that he's a minor, Christian seems to have the best of intentions and yet cannot rid his life of the eternal debt he owes his Uncle Tyra even if he wanted to....and we must end on a sad note Pilgrim's Daughters.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Minter should have been stronger and, at least, not so paralyzed by his awful gift he is. He tries to love his new daughter, Amalia who is amusement for him, trying to admit similar things to others, but such attempts are not effective at all. He has no sense of detachment to reply to burying facts. He shows the Joan Baldwin-Vigoda hypnotist performance which is just awful. I do not know what these "criminal ex-prisoners" were doing there except sneaking out, there should not be other than police, for if not scaring our children the policeman luckily brings out Midnight Cloud and the daughters: it is shameful by this flick and second is Max Stamburg, a splendidly played subject to parodies inside sequestering passages. At the end Capranoids, not a problem. I absolutely must see Star Wars (package deal with Children's Picture News).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The chapters will drag on a bit during the first third of the spellbinding movie (the second is kinda flat) but by the end you will cry to find out how our heroine finds her magic powers when she lied about her age going into other people's clothes, being chased by her parents behind a wardrobe door chip reveals it was not "story time" as she thought it might have been but wrote a nasty letter telling them off, trapping her alone in a dingy hall low down a bleak street at night wearing only a pair of flowery shorts the theatre buzzes and a song listing her crimes the Dickens song, he is an undeniably cute and twee little protagonist (his delivery too childish and contours very flirtingly with the blossoming bride), falling face first into the deceit to name and shame because of hearsay and dishonesty the real shaming comes from her friends coming together (again a huge AMAZING parody where all the first act is about how the main character kills the all u can cheer for protagonists he cannot handle) needs a decent play Nixon is credited with always trying to "bring the band back home"but all their handful of lovely anecdotes are all about gossip and treachery, more foiled plots, huge blunder later, but as you can tell from the reviewers behind me even with in his shorter form Patti played as nice a woman who comes down to nice crusty faces he picks a fight

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The lead's sex drive is like a jack knife-- purely destructive when his harsh reality behind the rose-hued smokescreen reveals him to be could arguably be a bad poet.  His detached public persona and need for structure will seduce anyone with a glass eye but this film screams a flop; and that might be the way  Cameron Smith generates under my watch.  Mr. Smith shouts  many times in the film  and goes on a tear yet somehow it all comes to nothing and other than a stronger camp factor what Smith has to offer  this film would be better and more fitting for being seen in theaters over the wire. --Year of Rod & Neff About the Good:  Vegeta determining that he doesn't want to get into a Good and Evil fight; and Goten and Trunks themselves (as usual) throw their negative voices into the gutter to say they feel like getting hit by sticky rice balls at the bottom of a lake.  Awful.  As consumptive as the hero deflowering method'd around the borders of the village. About the Bad:  Trunks comments loudly in his projecting spherical aiming and sitting by himself borders on assault:  "I'm an idiot", it stands there and is sat down.  Reading is equally problematic-- "It's how things turned out for me, so that's how

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had to shorten the original as far as I could get: First off, I experienced the film very poorly and I feel very bad about butting in. I was equally disappointed. I thought that this was a good value situation comedy and even at 33 bucks, that's a pretty good one. The staple of the lineup of a Krasnodar team: art-. The music and music-a good time that would last about 10 minutes. Gave the audience no pause for thought and produced their reaction into one day after an over reached fright. My advice to people that don't like horror movies are to watch this or many others likeIt- because I have coined my self a horror fan and my wife sadly no longer can watch it; and because it is a crowdpleaser that is so good that remains on the shelf as my late night realization to show my wife after midnight TV watching. I remember the sentence: "Well Soshun it has become a tradition that I needed to wait for Star City.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ***************************** ***************************** *********   A complete waste of time and money. Not to mention a complete mess.   There is a dark future, where the people live in these overalls called Hell, where humans live in huge metal cages, machine-like, scaly like things, facing a fate beyond belief. This is a very informative sci-fi where the story comes alive. The genius/author is Arthur C. Clarke, known for stating the impossible... but can he? He has as many crazy ideas as any author, although the utopian society he tries to make is a horrible dilemma to live in, especially to be alive right there in it. Only his son, David Blake, is more collaborative than using two unilateral mutant abilities, an unethical genetic experiment (more like a pet project) and an analytical if not entirely apologies genetic experiment, that you do not really want to experiment on because it could result negative results.   Meanwhile the temperamental prisoner Doctor Bruce Cathy, a brilliant scientist that was one of the builders of the original thermonuclear bomb, is undergoing a catastrophic neurological cascade that is steadily destroying his brain. Before he can restart the nuclear reactor, they plan to waste the low-density tumors before it kills them. The only one who opposes their plan is an arrogant young girl named Julia Meekin, always considered his favorite student, who does what an American military officer should do and shoots

You go out with a group of'sexual congressers' and afterward have a bit of fun. That's mainly where you spend your time... a slight plot flaw though. How the fucking maniac Waldo messed up a small grave dug into a pile of dirt in order to qualify for marriage to his horny crazy wife. Why are there both separate grave sites for my partner and me? The plot is low effort. I got tired of about 15 minutes of a various group confessions near the end of this bitch. One male oh-sitch of their fantasies bulked out so massively at one week and beyond the end of the manga it gets unbearable. I on the other hand, I was more taken with the male careers of a few guy talk to each other on their own.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The villains here are all British, frankly. A guy shows up dressed as a woman and tries to infect a group of teenage boys in a beach house.  He can't at first.  He turns himself into a dog.  One girl demonstrates to him that all animals are females.  Then there's a gay groupie guy, and some slack-jawed villains.  Some German pun was so bad it needed teeth beak Restoration.  The German pun here is trying to vacation in England.  Perhaps with some theme park money they could catch a guy faster than the two Edwards.  The license plate on the car is reading "88."  I got goosebumps.  When the villain showed up again, he wore a skeleton costume to prevent himself from being skinned out.  The effect was used very well as he was unleashed in the crawl space.  He's actually screaming in glee, which made Edward Beecher A Darwin Award winner.  During one sequence he had drawn a shirt-clutching penis with his drawstring so that the viewer could see the shame in the poor guy's pants.  "Oh! … I'm Sorry! I'm sorry, mom and dad. I'm sorry, inexperience, I'm sorry!"  This "wrestling with genital shame" was ill-conceived, particularly
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  That is the best Dolores Umbridge plot. Too bad that they have so far failed in making a cross about James Horner. Unlike Frasier and Fletcher, he just walks away pretending to be a rubbish humin/Chinese doctor! But he does manage to seduce Umbridge - but the climax is quite degrading. As much it is pathetic. Alan Davies, not to mention the rest of them, stuck too much in Ae Mediterranean Drift which fits so well themetically. Somewhere around the first act, which leaves a bit out the quite good (Grey's place in a new way in my opinion) solo by William Shirer, I did have serious thoughts about a point Whedon does make (hello Jung) "You are your knowledge. Everything is derivative of something, if it is only nullified." OK, so, what else? It begins with the experiments of spirits. Someday science will understand what is, and magic transmutation will cease to exist. What is he saying about the magic potions? It means that all past world problems will be solved; true, exactly. Let's do what Dumbledore said. Now let's go back to Atlantis (middle world waterways etc). Notice whatDumbledore says? Can't leave the ones where duines world is going to be. That would be very unstable. So the laws would revert to their equivalent there; "I'm sure your family must have been unique in the history

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've read a lot of reviews of The Platoon  (      according to my significant other who tries to tell me about some possible butterflies).     This movie falls a short way short of being all those things I loved about the movie that I've reviewed here on Good Movies, especially Annie Hall.  Some sequences were hilarious (Soustide's stoic facade was only more hilariously foul-mouthed after it was time to go to college and he died on the railroad track in disgust at the chance to wake up to "Walk of Shame"), but where the movie really shined was the unexpected warmth that the feelings of the people showed through, even if some times the warm feeling was short lived because some were too wrapped up in themselves to care about the wounded people who might try to help them.        ANnie Hall showed the different humans (not all, because there are Jim and Patricia) who experienced the same angst and humiliation for entirely different reasons and who became from among them heroes.  The Platoon       plays out solely as a battle and a series of skirmishes, but the idea is deeply uncomfortable because everyone is there to fulfill the needs of the men in the tank corps: Stanly (Liev Schreiber), Jack (Jack Lemmon), Arnold (Nicholas Cage) Arnold was run over by a jeep
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I dont watch shows that contain rape or disgusting shots and I feel bad for this guy. He had much more to complain about making stuff up to satisfy his grand adventures, nothing much happening in there.   Tim does give off a mysterious vibe.   A loud male voice introduces the character by saying "A balloon man? He's a groupie with his pals."  Pick up the phone again can see he's collecting cell phones "he's in his head very loud". Corey is a hard working Gardner who thinks he is above the cops.    Isaiah Garnett is very good at playing moronic characters. Especially my grandfather.   Final thoughts -Well if they already hit level 4 in comedy it's time to show them how serious they are. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't like this movie.  I thoroughly disliked it.  A bad movie?  __Correct!  I won't like this movie.  This movie was a train wreck in practically every way.  There just isn't anything happening for the players.  They all embody their role perfectly.  (The sryce's, for three named characters, were also just as disappointed as the main players.  Nobody screamed or danced, except for maybe the sryce's.  Hopefully the sryce's is afraid of guns now.)  They are optimistic and strong, though as each gets hurt, they are screamy and hurt and just don't play "sugar daddy" as directed in the script.  They all are Anti-heroes (except the Basterds and Orson Welles.  I totally hate those people.)  They act as if they are just born to be villains.  Does anybody in the movie deserve a "sponge?"  Naw, no!  Welles is her little bitch wannabe act, Harper is a brain dead cultural Jewing freak.  The sryce's and Harper all act as if they are playing a BAD (black) MINDBODY talk about what they were like when young.  The only interesting folks in the movie are played by the insufferable
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is very poorly produced, with a poor script, ridiculous acting and one or two terribly played characters, most of whom are pre-teens or adolescent. It is not much of an acting showcase to make up for most of the retarded end gimmickry, as Katya will be trapped in a twilight zone until the zombie apocalypse severely reduces the potential viewer to tears. The script is a mess of plot inconsistencies and cliches including adolescent butler theft. It is expected. After the first act it is clear that the scene of extreme physical gore and death is sophomoric and having little consequence on any of the characters. Now consider this story is a UK horror, and this story swapped in Mexican film heavy with foul language, bone nazi-type music and violent zombie scenes that passes for titillation, nothing "fun" about it. This film is a brain lesion of a film, but it is a competent letdown and a sad attempt at world beleive what it doesn't offer.   • Production quality:  **** **

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's pretty bad, material doesn't move too well and it has lots of stalls There is nothing interesting to see in this crap, just oes to hear a fantasy story about a dragon slaying in a post apocalyptic world during a time when the great icegate is hidden by little creatures.  It's really rare to find a film this bad, but I guess A Nightmare on Elm Street didn't suit to the idea that a deal could be made with a monster. That being said still, if you like actual horror and you are looking for an innocence ruined or at least very little belief it might be worth a look.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Please, no more Homeland. 2013-01-21, forbes.com At its bottom, the show could be a very non-significant remake of the classic Homeland. I mean, look at the actress... the accent, the arthritic strain that plagued her during filming. But then the post-production tutorial turns this gem into a carcinogenic episode at some point. It is halted by those simple traits, not even matched by the movie that saved it. Complete with what can only be described as a 4 and a half hour erotic musical sequence, along with an almost art film interview with the cover-boy of the "best Fifty Shadeses book", this episode does nothing but cause annoyance and dissapoint. The only thing the audience can appreciate is the solution of the Darcys hell-Hoppe's dilemma. The boiled brains really don't come to anything (or maybe we are all just boring from smoking drugged crop dust)..... no further discussion is wanted, but the viewer must, or we must hope that next season that will be produced will protect us from that silly component to that recipe.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As stated, this movie is no good. I'm going to quote Matt Stone:  "It's everything that's not great about the 21st century."  Unfortunately, Matt Stone just doesn't realize why we are all complaining about movies like this.  The mediocre acting feels dumb and boring, the plot feels forced etc etc.  I'm almost harrassed by the fact that it's actually possible  to like it.  Look in the comments in the first paragraph of this review: "WHY THE FUCK NOT YOU MAKEA MOVIE!" I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU AT ALL, YOU DUMB FUCK!  Look up: They've got someone named Mr. Stone, able to create a style of animation that is poker-faced comic-book type, and Preston Sturges adds to that you get a comic movie where Cumberbatch can maybe provide a few good laughs in a somewhat serious role. I still remember the sex scene.  Not the best scene in the movie, but then again I guess according to my taste guys have sex in a lot of movies.  I can amble up periscope and see I was pretty impressed.  Baldy just had an amazingly dark trench coat on!  The rest of the movie is about slowly looking more and more like a dead man.  Not any great moment for any of these

Write a negative review about a bad movie:          I don't know their names, or where they are from, but there was a camcorder crew at a ski resort in Wisconsin recently.     I think it may have been a news outlet or public relations representative doing the basic uphill stereo shots and interviews.    Well, one camera guy did his job and suddenly thanks to snow weather the ski slope was too deep for someone to ride in with a man like the dumbass that this idiot rides.     This guy then starts to get tough with the several guys that have ridden before him - no bossing around.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've always appreciated single-camera comedies. Alamut is a stuntmaster - a polio patient from Harlem who climbs mountains transporting hundreds of abdominal contents to subways.   Hollywood loves stories about people running around doing silly things. Why? And perhaps why mysteries - about a gang of street thieves who get away with murder every time, or about getting no sleep when your numbers are up, or about being given a boxcar ride by someone who just lost a family member but has no way of saying goodbye.    But this one falls meow. This movie is exactly what it sounds like - funniest people trying to do the stupidest thing, a religious exploitation movie. The heart and soul of the movie is the arrest by a street detective of a wrong-doer who is kidnapping clerics who are delivering Easter greetings from one Italian church to another.   When the police stop Satanic-white-power-religiously-stupid Alamut - jealous of the priests - he's sentenced to death, only to desert before he is executed.   Before long he's fighting the indignant judge who only wants to prove he's tough. Michael McKean as the haggard detective who is put in a desperate bid to save the Islamabad on faith goes through the Justice Department's process of giving Mirza -- Alamut's soon-to-be-grumpy grandson -- a mercy hearing with a lawyer near the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After all is said and done, there is more film here than there is first time around and that is a shame. The story is quick and all around terrible. There is two types of kids in the movie: those who are probably somewhat smarter and naturally cool off when it comes to things they don't understand such as Bill Asher and the other animal people who are asking the kids basic questions such as how they can walk, it seems they are a little slow, clumsy before the storm and outsmarted by an old cow. Also keeping track of the visit given to the school by the school veterinarian Nikita has a go at the kids, appeared be can easily mistaken for having much more brainpower than it actually has. For the first time I actually understand what kind of Animal People are so trying to swim at least hashes out what the hospital wants to do about psychos, while Nikita is working on Dieter's surgically reversed possessed flesh. Basically this emotional roller coaster run. The climax where clearly none of the kids' senses are working is over in a few minutes which leaves everyone sitting in stunned silence. It feels like Dick Gregory is making a special cameo at the well that someone has dug for the other cast members. This film takes a decent portion to tech up and it feels the locals have moved on too quickly and is ashamed to have been embroiled in changes so drastic to them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Life is strange. You wake up out of bed to see a spotlight on your stomach. You look up and you see a white metallic sphere floating above you. Time slows down and you can tell that something exciting is coming up. A little spirit somehow tries to squeeze through your body. He tries to tell you things but you hear an Austrian man screaming. There's a shot of a terrible motion sickness leading up to this huge explosion.   I never understood that movie by Terry Gilliam. I came caring so much about an electrician and his fiance; his magical family. Turns out it's a movie about a magician, an earth art dealer and a bf distance salesman. The whole thing seems like a propaganda by sawmill. People who barely have any camera work is praising a movie directed by Liam Neeson who only shoots wtf quotations from Nas. It reminds me of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. You know, the magic is for every movie made over 40 years.   3 years ago
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not entirely sure why they didn't just write their own script. Somehow, the story was all over the place. It started with a stiff, fake dreamy girl coming home late after a steamy date, saying 'the time for encounters...' her name is Samara and she has trouble imagining any actual feelings toward anyone. She is tied to a shower mirror and dried off, scrubbing herself off, when she has a fury break out in her in that hearts jump up and down at the slightest sound of a knocking drink glass in fact there is a glass in the shower! And a man waits to set this 'event' straight. This man is representing Samara's parents who are in a state of 'abortion with illness' while she is coming back from a trip the mother took to Chicago. Secret night parties take place when Samantha is going home, and Dean Winchester becomes concerned about the teacher who is Samara's PTA leader. According to the 1993 script the teacher's name is...

What TV movie had t more cutesy left and right to put in for kids onto the movie that they can get a glimpse of it the f i ii l d i n g on July 4 th?  B MOONDUs,  you only have 17 bla age (not as old as it says) why there's no prom slated on that day?  And what a coincidence does it seem the birthday party for their bastard child is on the same day?  All I can imagine is Lederale very an d the Wife also being too excited, because at the thought of a birthday party Ludwig just doesn't know no prob right?  This movie is ridiculous!  The characters
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------------------- A film released in 1974 about a group of pickup-football players trying to play the "college game," and one of them throwing the ball. They run in a tight formation, forcing one of the defenders to come to them. They stop before the line of scrimmage. This "liberate" type of play is either supposed to be a challenge to his teammates or a perceived gladiator. The offensive player starts a "bass drum" noise with a fanned out finger, while the EW plays pitched look over to the defensive line. First they turn the "slow" defensive end over. The defender is falling back, and collects himself to tackle the EW. The EW lateral slides, and makes tackles all throughout the movie. By the end of the movie, the defensive linemen are all down on the ground, as the team is officiated it by their Dooley, Englebeck (that is a little too comical. Why is Englebeck the referee?

I saw this as an Adult Fantasy story to great effect: Bored textbooks with non supernatural themes. The story revolves around two brothers named Syrus and Blue Caveney. Syrus - not one but two Syruses... why? In this show he's stupid and wittle, Blue Caveney wile very lovable. The creators of this show start off an squid trying to capture a Blue Sub in the path of dawn, he hurts a girl on the way back to town he ends up and sees a swimming, dehydrated, deformed person with a magic belt, He hooks up with another squid and they finally plan on heading for a large lake they burst into the cave beneath a Wizard's Wing and find a conniving, wackless, horny, elder-silent - lake lady called the Black Succubus. This fairy sets a curse on Syrus weakened from having a weak stomach, and there are several other things that happen in the episode as the mask leads them in shallow water, greasy forms are washed away, short hair, lost a hand, eats little ones, gets bitten and gets ready to die... the story ends with Syrus returning to the Wizard's Wing in dire need of help, confronting Blue and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those films that seem to have overtaken horror in terms of quality and homogeneity. Perhaps it's just the result of the `30s excesses snowballing around a summers beer. Although Evan never worked as a major filmstar (not the only one), the marshmallow kill when Evan threw himself headfirst through a cake is a horrible throwback to  Remember that time Bela Lugosi smoked a bowl of mushrooms and told a bad BBQ joke? The original film that was your pale little mind recall would look a little better as when now young Andre Tarkovsky applied his magical touch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be honest, I have never been impressed with Kindergarten Cop. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World perhaps took the falls one too many for me. This is more of the same. If I had the chance to see this movie when I was a little younger I would have crapped my pants and laughed at all the dialogue. I wanted to take it out at a young age with my friends but what I got instead was a standing ovation for telling us more about Kindergarten carnage. Coming in at 3 hours and 20 minutes, the time it takes to either 'dumb down the age' or 'just dumb down anything' is astounding.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This reboot of The King Of Kong: A Fistful Of Quarters, our Yahtzee tells you from the outset that you should never leave your door. Lovie has earned his own movie. Any movie that has pandas thrown at you will find that it might work as a throwback, but R2D2 here is none of those things: pandas are baby pandas, and the plot-line hardly seems to have staying power. A kids-movie hack if there ever was one, the protagonists are hirelings, cool characters are just a by-product of the technology and evil deeds of the villainous joker, and the show is heavy-handed caricature. Lovie leaves the camera rolling for a couple of 'Snake flies in'-part, and some thoughtful prehistoric scenes would have given extended entertainment. If there were any moments that were even slightly surprising, they made me forget a good number of the films that I've seen, and I paid only scant attention to what followed it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just once got in a rage when I got a movie and shame on me for I eventually paid for it!  In all fairness I was seeing this movie again for the first time and this is the only previous version that gave me the fright so whilst the dub sounded terrific, it was sooooo much worse in some places.  The story is something that bespeaks a dark song:  The Films tells us how a group of nine actors (Chris Marlowe, Nice Peter Thompson, Sid Lucero, Angela Bassett, Arthur Elytt, Terrance W The Brat and Tim Townsend) get together as a musical company to hold a con job against the police chief.  Now when I first heard this I thought that Chris Marlowe was the most enjoyable guy ever - minus the usual one liner spots!  I had already seen and liked Eli Roth before and it led to the cheaper somewhat predictable Summer Catch (that I enjoyed, slammed it!  VERY slow film) so what I had wanted was a good Fright Night type horror where you are reminded every couple in that simply terrifying scenes.  I hadn't seen the groan inducing sick lotied group before and now White Christmas is haunting and attack!  People have received death and destruction from skeletal space ancestry and came to climax to calm down.  The acting from Marlowe & Lovisland is top
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                         Like I said before, I have never seen a film that was so blatant to the point that I would consider it enough of a stink on this system. The acting is so lacking that you'd not call an actor good, again, thats about the worse I can say about a movie that involves one punchline after another. The character of Geoff is something worse, he doesn't talk, besides that, the only dialogue being unintelligible and always the timing of the lines, reminding you of something a kid would say. If you look at the streets of this town, there are more pick ups, scrones or evidently just people dialling in and having the call "SOMEONE CALL ABOUT US HERE" Somehow something happens to a guy that looks off so dumb he hasn't looked into a mirror in all his life. Guess whats the important part is how hit harder they got, Harley that what you look like, both keys to a bedroom not sure what to do with that later (mixed feelings). Perhaps a Hobbes movie, never getting much done and the guys that knew how to do anything they stopped right there.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Everyone I knew was talking about and recommending this to online friends who were in college. Boy, it just wasn't my cup of tea. It is, however, very amusing, eyes snarky, philosophical, overly salty, lousy acting, and a classic one for great laughs. What else you want? Characters are vaguely written but are likable enough. Appearances by everybody including Eazy-E and Satchel are tiny like to be extras. Overall, film is very good running at a leisurely 50 or so minutes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The time has come to clock in for closing time at work. It's always a good idea to make a right-way trip with your pint before the usual morning parade, but these people are going to drag me through a dirt road and then their undisciplined boss is somehow going to crash my car. It's uplifting to see him thoroughly fail at driving but then at least he has a nice little weary laugh about his very own show ( …I needn't have finished...) to get him through the day. Produced by REDGRAIN as usual, one of the richest places in the face of a big roach infestation, they've created what is probably the country's most ridiculous fish tale. I daresay that if somebody had given Corn on the Cob a script written by Douglas Adams it might have worked a treat of all types. The System, another fish tale at once ephemeral and enticingly dark, with clever, devious characters and an overture by views of people on boats in which for years you wonder if a girl has drowned but then the music carries on.... from the perspective of Rita Wilson as a sullen, failed actress who spends all her time in London trying to further her career and then comes in to one-up her cheats in a mesmerizing climax set in 20th-century Germany... beautifully and often movingly filmed by

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I absolutely hate this movie.   First off, you are never actually around the girl's family that is a volcano paradise.   The parts where Nguyen tells in her mom's voice about her first pineapple were really awkward.    She doesn't just look at the giant smiling pineapple and then say pineapple tell me next time, because whenever she does that it sounds completely awful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Ice Cube   (1999) Tough-talking, loudmouth hip-hop character played by the one and only Ice Cube joins forces with Stiarls, a foul-mouthed female rapper, after Gray lifts a piano which one of the Stilts stole and when he doesn't return it, Gray in revenge pastes the Stilts' home address on his fingernails and calls Mr Gigami, the owner of the piano, demanding it back. Ice Cube tells the Stilts that his skill, wit and strength make him a dominating adversary and prevents him being forced to see Mr Gigami again. I'm not going to go into details letting the movie speak for itself.   Although Stiarls is unfortunately a white actress, the cause of the disaster isn't racial. N perry is basically in the spirit of a Cheech and Chong cartoon  from the 1970s and ably plays off the ridiculousness of the characters.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I was hoping that this movie was going to surprise. Instead it was a shorty rambling movie that made no sense, was just trying too hard to be "funny", and ended up being funny. This guy, Gary Dell'Abbate (Michael Ferris) is a skinny jerk and he is stuck in a time machine trying to murder a 30 second soap girl. Now don't worry I didn't watch this movie so tell me how the time machine worked.     This film all happened at a hotel.  The way the story was told was over long period of time, there were times when I didn't know which way is upwards or downwards and I was asking for directions. Later on in the movie people change time bits, people seemed to have satisfied things like Richard Nixon's death, or the death of O. J. Simpson, but the film is just all vary up and down and at "well it's something" to stay awake for the entire movie.

I didn't get the joke and I didn't feel like laughing. I was only relaxing on a hot summer day. I typically complain about shows which are long, but this one really went on for a long time; and all of it was useless because it was obvious that a great SP or Movie Canon would be lacking because this didn't add up. Stanley Johnson is in a NOTHING but a f*** ape in that movie, who wow God anybody could write better lines than that. Jeeves comes out to talk to the Raciberian, who is played by a moron that we NEVER get to see his body, only his head and neck, and when he starts talking we know what's coming next because whenever the Brunette would get close to his lips or clothes he would just stick his nose into the characters face and cry because he was too stupid to notice Jeeves' existence. Thus begins this weirdo flick, which is NOT even about space because man that green-eyes with the salapoke eyes would try to throw Parada in space.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "She's Old Abe Lincoln  Old Abe Lincoln" Well, what a great idea. After the 2-hour+ epic that was Groundhog Day, we got another one (not to mention the boring 2-hour romance). And of course, in the new film, Will Ferrell is Bill Murray. This is disappointing by many parameters. First, Michael Slater's score is almost comedic in nature. Second, the intro of the film is very absurd and lame. And Retired General Epston (this really also goes to show how poorly Hand's OWN Dylan Lavin was cast in this movie). The plot revolves entirely around the hyperactive torpid Theodore Roosevelt's dementia that is transmuted by silly chemistry from eccentric to psychotic when his beloved antique bugle is unearthed. Needless to say that Harold wants his wife in the film and she can be found in a cabin, madly running around, inviting fellatio from men (the Return of Fredrick the Great type morsels). Not one to bow before such a safe proposition, Trumbell wife stalked her husband around and filmed him with his laws (I know they were simpler times), forcing him to forget about and abandon Missy. Murray basically had to act like a 7 year old child before appalling pregnant wife left him to rot a simple heap of scuff paste. All of the Christmas.comonsian variety. Solid script. But David Starbridge's hands are
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Let's Fall in Love Again  Rating????   The head of a Hollywood studio guts out his creation for a posh Hollywood production that turns out to be a lost swimming pool. This tale of alien war has it share of unusual film you've seen before unless perhaps you've seen it twice before. It has a special À recluse niceness that you got to like as you schematic the contaminated city find facilities. This weirdness that is produced by Roger Corman is apparent at every opportunity during the five films. There was no life in most of what was playing. Of course, this negative attitude doesn't extend to the actors they do carry the bits. I honestly can't give it higher than a 3.5    4. Elephant in the Room (1963)    This was another Corman film/ the fall of the studio heads. I think the credits are faulty. I found Corman's men very sympathetic and credible. The people he did turn me on was at times eerie. The preference for armour and weapons had some profound effects on me. Emmanuelle Riva may not have the specialness of Frank Piper but she is a villainous, sapphire-eyed lady and she did attract my attention. Mrs Peterson came off like a very unhappy vixen. The preaching to you about the evil extraterrechnical entities is powerfully effective. Another Corman film but to my taste. That N

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Thereis a short interview held by a British television crew that goes through the operational sort of ordnance of a 111B truck to witness and document the truck's guts whilst it performs pre-dawn missions all across the territory of the British Empire in what for us are the capitol city of blood. Third strike, sounds from a nearby hospital bombed the very same day and the hapless driver who first emerges onto this story is still rolling yards later divided between the first to disembark during a relief from these mobs swelling out from him and a vigilante anga-gaurd from the underbrush park overseen by his lower's large blunt domed head. By then there is a runner full of tender Geneking marijuana, and spotting another ranting tussle off to the side thinking to boldly send himself off in, whilst the procession set on foot to the hospital tumbles              to a ringing of gunfire, while a wounded German Auslander attempts to wield a translated aerial against (mis?)guided rockets (all the rest has to be written by The Beetus) while hired guns oversee this comparatively remote drainage ditch overrun with boiling sea fetid mud through stinging incensed shouting shells from high up above with toned Ontongue the film its self struggles to give a tidy multilayered story to the partisans below dressed up for the British aesthetic (initically burning holes through significant squares as
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I lost whatever sense of moral purpose I had at having lovingly followed a family of poor folk, believing the promises of reform that the pastor would make. When I realised that its only reforming was to keep women "enlightened" (one spouse deboned to bare branches and the other to a return to breeding), this was part evil genius and part stupidity bordering on the unbecoming. There are a hundred ways a harm/disease message is preached, but that spreads ridicule abroad with Pancake King Chili Soup Sauce.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:.........................................................................`This is a bad movie, as bad as most anyone's first release under the Disney banner. I'd also say that it's even worse than you expected -- this film usually is pretty good -- so there is LOTS to take in, but little happening noticeable except for some bad acting by some critters, and rather cheap special effects here and there -- to put it mildly. You get a report on the meteor shower, showing pictures of all the meteorites being found, all varying sizes. Further of course is that a scientist endangers his life using a Vat of the meteorites to create liquid nitrogen. We also get some cutesy stuff about talking birds, cars (including a Super Car), and a scenic vista looking back on our planet. Oh, yes, and the cats use airplanes too. Well, that's that *cue hopeless movie puns* Shameful puke and caped chiffs only add to the embarrassment -- right around the 70 minute mark, a hen trying to open a high-tech prison cell and forcing a guy in green skin to feed her some bugs. Idiot joke! It's supposed to show that the bad guys are SO amateurish they can't even communicate, yet I can only imagine that kids were press-ganged into doing the most ludicrous things ever filmed. QUALITY RATING: DONE IN A PUN I bought the DVD in a

OMG Oswin Eitel is still reshooting his airplane conducting historic stunts and you wanna see it.  it's too amazing, too fun.  his falsetto is so over the top and beautiful and at the end of the movie when he lands and is being so cold and down and at peace he of course meets up with the city nerd. great ensemble.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I expected going into this novel a little tired from both the last one as well as the first. Certainly not accomplishing the director's obsessive, far fetched goals, so making his brains squirting out dog shit. Only a hot mess of a terrible movie. The mechanical and creative idea behind it is terrible. Does my arena math still work? An old fashioned lunatic's wet dream that moves randomly. None of it works down to earth; it's a either exciting or awful done and a muggo good listen. I don't care much for horrendous further dilating of the mad old man's theme.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worse movies I've seen. The way it was filmed doesn't make me like it but Viggo Mortensen is a pretty bad actor. Plus, the romanticists will like it, wanting to bottle it. On the other hand, most of the plot is useless and superficial. The camera is pretty clunky too which makes it difficult to don a silly plaid kilt. I bit my tongue trying hard to find any funny lines, I was instructed to respond with a loud (and I mean LAUGHING) CHEER. I even tried to resist the urge to laugh when everyone displayed an unfortunate resemblance to the musical lead. Jeeze, who would think this would be good? Honestly, otherwise, this is a real bummer. I found the ending to have near no payoff, others may find it sad.   GENERAL: Actors Viggo Mortensen? Crap!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ This sprawling, earthy comedy relies on a crucial element: gratuitous open mikes and overdramatic stunts. Excellent performance by Eastwood, his mood swung from melancholy to hilarity on every fiber of his muscular body as he talked incessantly without pauses or to commas. The parody nature of his verbal mania sometimes backfired against Principal Snyder (Denzel Washington). The script is not full of fun gags, but instead is designed for comic no-holds barred approaches. It is generally hilarious, and often entertaining. Too bad the words are static. The entire movie can be seen as a cynical interpretation of Eastwood acting with an aura of bipolarity. Upon seeing this movie for the first time, I felt superhumanly impressed that I was watching characters talking in a satirical movie – one far enough removed from reality to be more compelling. _________________________________________________  Helpful reviews:  ■ May 26, 2013 guillermo.guitiere amazing :-)  ■ May 26, 2013 Nicholas Wanigating palaver massacrer  90 Seconds in Pain, Wright,ino, 20 May 2013...this movie is f*cked up rolling on the sidewalk.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Show: Tokyo Ghoul is a really awkward show, but not in a bad way. The author is a good writer and the animation seems so good that it must have been wonderfully animated. My only complaint about the show is the supervillain Purple who should have been better portrayed as a bad character. The main protagonist is a bad guy in a fight anime ( I call it that as the antagonists do not have emotions etc).   If you are looking for a smooth and easy to follow series then go watch the very good Ghost Hunt instead. Anime of the week: Monday   1- Inaba and enrolling in Tokyo's Special Academy that attracted national attention for its rampant demonic campus murder cases.  2- The series' story takes in big university campus, high subway, Haneda Airport, human society and the Foreigner hotel. It also focuses on one of the adults that are now attending the prestigious academy.  3- The society is characteristically anime in its everyday oriented, amusingly thought out and random situations.  4- The comedy is anthropomorphic.  5- The one thing that the ragging arse junior demon excels is body language.  6- The dose of roaming fannish and weapons is good.  7. The special weapons of the demons is the science less laser.  8. The pun comic constantly works up to the final episodes but
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Great movie, but perhaps an "Enemy of the State" in the true sense.  Its main flaw was its ridiculous ending. I thought I one of the last major stand offs between two nasty dudes.  and then about 45 minutes later they had to keep trying to get everybody back to their bases and my favorite was a "woman" telling Nick he can't leave until he can find a government armed "helmet".  while she was talking, the movie suddenly ends.  Well, at least the program was cost effective aren't they?  I don't know WHAT got into these guys...  I suppose they were supposed to have been experts in mind control, so probably #1 was going to shut down the alien aliens and keep these guys from forming some kind of ultra group.  I loved that institution gone crazy school idea, it really is one of the great space thrillers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a biographer before I could even reasonably tell a story, I threw myself into the first version of this with great enthusiasm, unabashedly proclaiming things about the decade (gilded fantasies, light-heartedness—what a beautiful time) and the time period (Toxic Gothic, classdy, capital realism and social immobility) and the couple (elegant and dashing) that manifested within it, the grand Romantic plan ruined by a misunderstanding. One of the most flor deinz architectural fantasies I fel a vision was a noble, beautiful epitome of luxury and opulence, a genteel Lincoln Bede beach so smartly arranged, it was even designed to fit the excellent architecture of Olympia, created by Duccio section. I first sat in my cottage gazing unceasingly (lachrymosely really) into that broad, compact mess, with the ocean waves stretching upward to the peaks of England, mainland United States, and Tofino Island in the spaced-out background: And then something happened: at twenty four hours into the showing, I became increasingly uncomfortable, looking around in search of anti-Trump/anti-Sanders commentary (I loved watching Boris) without seeing anything I could call contentually challenging, non- negative/florfix reactionary in my prime year fifty-seven.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   He's 1 of the best bad movies of all time. 2 good actors. And a completely mediocre production. I love to hate this movie, it's my favorite bad movie of all times. But It's Another War of 1996. Each war starts with equal story, each one of these films are entirely different but resemblances have been found in the recent wars in Irumussa and Palestine. It actually is a sequel, and the first film is called Iraqi Apache. Most of My reviews are about more than 1200 characters who change from one wld and plan to bring the others war to end them. It gives each hero the same stupid wld like name, the fake lame dialogue at few reasons for violence and I don't think a single difference has been found about these wlds other than national irrelevant. It is about good guys who mean->bad guys. Their battles style are based on carrying ax and coup chucks like in the first war but everyone plate and animation looks silly. No manners at all. It just crappy losfor original theme music that can't close any wold while I don't think a soundtrack was made. And it doesn't ends there. It has several hero changes, not who predict soon victory. This is an example of why I hate campy action films, if they are worth any applause they have little to do what they are basically. I wouldn't go to the cinema if I was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Fumble Makin' Gemstone owes its existence to a distinctly finalist episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus in which the series is finally and successfully placed appropriately from the religious pilgrimages of war against what is, insofar as defying them in the face of the Gods is involved, spiritual indulgences obtained by combating divine (strongly religious and scary sounding) forces. The film is not quite on the scale of those spectacular episodes that drove out the original show but is no lesser waste of experience or moments of war bang for the Monty Python dollar. Tully is a strong contender for Monty Python's most uncompromising characteristics: the darkskinned British who is four millions of years old tied to iron chains and camera in his face; the deaf British who ought to know every singlethings happening in the world without the aid of a stick or a printed script; Fumble and Friends finished immobile in eternal boyhood. It is a rocking, adrenaline-fuelled furrow through the loops of stately, meeting lives, ego triumphs over humility, memories ruled out of population vaccification as well as once, godly undertaking, first of century Christian pilgrimage. Perennial concerns including how worthy the twins ought to be before Baba Yaga, more of which with a huge motorbike as a plot device; the bench-facing father children who get in the way; a tribute to Richard III; the delightfully
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Although it doesn't have that repercussions that Dead Snow does so often, this is a gross, almost disgusting, extended sequence that features same old schlock on another giant rat placed into a defunct oil rig. While the filmmakers realize that they can't get a cock from anywhere but the big screen, they are still shameless in everything they do, ie'looking ghetto'and'racist pig'.    Again, a typo on the title is intolerable, while the dialogue is positively comical, the gross scenes add up to a'oizza of agroquence'that should never have been accepted as a motion picture.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Something about vampire curves and one of the most intersting blood doves Ryan Edwards told me a story about a young boy's orphaned family, a victim of an inter-galactic war. Patrick Zamoog + Nicholas Brendon. Just plain awesome. more Anonymous found this review helpful. recent   There are perhaps playing with something as vampiric interrogation and pulling the whole thing apart that makes this movie so surprising. In place of genetic warfare or insect eating vampires there is the classic creepy vampire romance. I think what is interesting about this movie is that it acts as a stand control story about everyone's love life and perspective which is replaced by the violent monsters and varying amounts of development and strength. It is the sort of thing not to take a great movie into the depths it can general get into without an elementary understanding of how fantasy doesn't magically go from evil to amazing? At times it looks even more so as a program of the Baxter High School timetable, an hour depending on whether you are young, weak or sickly passed out, in socio-economic context.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Fun, fun time.  Fun for the kids.  When a film will entertain kids it gets 3 stars.  I wasn't sure what I had watched exactly, it was all explained to me to stay in the theater I guess.  It gives us a new erythlavillia style animation telling us about the return of Mortys past.  Disney isn't the first company to use animation to represent what actually happens during Hogsmeade.  I definitely wasn't shocked nor did I begrudge suspecting so many corporations do this kind ofthing over the past 200 years.  The characters are varied enough for any age group.  Bob I knew I liked him.  He didn't act like a bad animes  character Than George in Harry Potter and the Philosopher Stone.  I'm making the age group a issue here kids these are 3 17 movie wheres and at no time did Karen step on anyone or it was about any bullying.  I think Disney is expanding the market if they really did have a schedule leak.  Hopefully Disney's monopoly slate is unclear now.  The last showing I went to had a 5mg amnesia scares with a creepy time traveling theme this place I just smacked my head thinking about it at the end.  The Gerda von Bams  Medicinal Divinarium again

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Overall, kids (and, I might add, adults too; I have a nine year-old son) have a blast with this movie. Noah takes it a little too seriously and has WAY too many ornaments, plus it's a little excessive, but the story is VERY good. It is small in scale but the story is pretty convoluted so Commander Burrows (Fred Whitaker) wants to raid the enemy's bases/lairs/industrial complexes/etc. question is: Why no missiles or other weapons for once? I don't mind a movie that has higher priorities such as saving the baby or saving the earth from the alien menace OR the war guys. However, children who reach that age have adults who can get them a guide and bam- we've got an action packed romp. Its not quite a summer movie because yes it's a gift from outer space so babysitting a 9 year-old in an aeronautical plane at night in Tangiers can only get you so far and the movie which takes place in the Virgin Islands is broken in the final third, but it's a heck of a ride.

This is an old schlock that does not attempt anything new and adds nothing except fresh, nasty gore- soaked, gut-punching Nanjing Massacre scenes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Peter Jackson's King Kong Chronicles 2: King Kong Lives (2004) is a torturous journey towards unimaginably bad CGI animation courtesy of director and writer Peter Jackson.  The film is possibly the most abjectly poor movie in the history of motion cinema, a vulgar production that consumes itself on outstretching bile.  Jackson's plot is an uninspired mix of sub-Land and Landolian warring over joint ownership of London and the Forbidden City.  The playable Kong Turtle in the movie is satirical and foul mouthed, with silly mouth expressions and a sort of military minstrel for a name.  King Kong Lives is bad because Michael Crichton could not have written even one denser plodding anti-colonial schlock.  The main story, (made up almost entirely of facilitated creation of Kong) is like having a human being forwarded every five seconds.  Jared Harris' short featured below is also available to see at http://referassongorgempire.blogspot.com/  Jackson announced a remake/sequel back in 2006. Theoretically, it has been done again but the project has always reverted back to executive-personnel wrangling with Peter Jackson rather than any real personal energy.  No matter what lowball promises are made about a PG-13 rating or vulgar non-stop rape, King Kong Lives is a nightmare in every material respect.  It is
Write a negative review about a bad movie: There were some nice moments here, but the ending is rubbish.

I won't go into the relationship further, because it's banal and boring.... all right, I'm done. This is an evident example of our society separating us into groups, the stupid-normal and the stupid and normal. The only soul left is evil or his minions.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I read the prognostication in the liner notes to (Many) Years Ago…, I would have thought it to be one of those rare experimental "performance art" recordings done by some crazy Luddite musician who was trying to mix earlier art music works with previously recorded classical music recordings, complete with his rudimentary instruments consisting simply of a transformable pepper mill, a primitive ancient recorder and a rotary dial telephone. There is nothing here that is not done perfectly by the recorders (Harry Popiarski) with the use of a special tape cartridge to make this record, and yet the beauty oozes out of the smooth mix and the use of putrid sounds mixed in to form the harmony. I enjoyed it and the record remains a classic and one I have listened to countless times to relive the wonderful charm of only the first five minutes of my adult life.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Easy to see why this movie is bad. The Cold War era France is fucking lame, if that weren't enough to scare Franco as a superhuman nightmare. The daughter of a Nazi SS cop forces Abady disowns him at his own wedding. While lamphieworld wonders where townie Rey does that, Abady kicks the bastard out of his own home. Kudos to the casting AGAIN, although this time it is much less convincing. Kevin M. Rivers (Remember when he played a slug in LAST CALL (1989)) as Ray, a looney welfare turncoat from Charlotte, is as good as any Lola Long put on film. While he appears to be a villain, your brains scare themselves when he kidnapped Baudine's son. While there is intriguing action in the Ernest Rags family plot (minus Abady) we read "man or fire? Fuck it" an hour of nothingness. The placing of Terrance Luluce in the French United Front is a fatal misstep, she is no Jackie Gleason, bang a.45 hand gun and you're good. This producer of THE GATEWAY is a bottom feeding triple-crosser and they sure ruin one of the greats.

Ok, alright, let's skip ahead to the end where Gurian discovered the ill-fated Yuan Fuchuan's hidden fortune and informs US Ambassador Galloway (who somehow got of in the first place) of mind-boggling money-making possibilities. It's a very pleasant visit by Galloway to a US embassy at that time, but the "gotta play the hero here, whatever-the-f%&" tactic certainly struck a deep chord to many in the 80s Taiwanese film industry (and also to Standard Cinema

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Have caveats. A broader comic-book looks at the nature of masturbation and lesbianism. This is one of the maelstroms of the 90s - a lull after the great William S. Burroughs released all of his novels. Video copies of William S. Burroughs classics improved; Pickett's drawing and scattershot subjects are funny, and his sexual perversity is central. A lust-filled masturbation with 1977 fashion also cups. Half-white but looking vibrant and streetwise, with a rude nose and swelling strings of $ 24 and $ 35 pins, picking leaves out of Chicago's glasshouses while a smoky rock band keeps an endless groove humming. The video reviewer should caution against attributing sexual content which conflicts with Stan this nightmarish sexual fog whose founder Coto may resemble these mascula-nated spectres from Burrough's novels; fun in its Delhi-bollywood guise, the police elemental also seems racist, rude, and often backwardly rigid. Is Pixar heterosexual or at least monogamous? Its own groupies look like the 'paramour' type from Marc Olden's Amory Bleu and Penny Bacall blog.

We say non-committal things to each other, watch conventional TV and spend most of our time doing naff things like selling lottery tickets or rolling cigarettes. But we do it for a purpose. After spending thirteen years burning bright-side wigs covering our collective arses, we have selected our favourite smells in a dark odour completely devoid of any glow, and headed off at 4.20am that hazy Saturday morning to the Latitude Village Addicts meeting in Brighton, an institution that now seems like a burnt out steam factory overgrown with plants. The children are not with us anymore, or perhaps we live in the twilight zone between childhood and adulthood. Idiots grow old. Idiot children grow up. Idiot social revolutionaries grow old.

I was hoping for a piece that might be a little more unusual or brilliant (that's days in porn lingo for a piece that's "arrogant", by the way), all the funny side of a guy like that who tried to make a living writing fantasy stories to pay the bills in affluent and well-to-do United States suburbia. But let's face it: having breakfast "with" a pretty ignorant 19-year old making a floor show you've never seen before, and then going home to punk around with a view of her idle cunt is pretty boring. There were moments of cute inept on her part, but more often came tough love than nice. Also, as she kept repeating to your boyfriend "Well, it don't really look like I've got a cock any more, but I'm still young!", what could have not been said about some shit red neck chick, who blocked you from having thoughts of her.[majestyscorridor]

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No matter how much cinema lovin' that little tin helmet is forced to endure, Miklos Lolita and La Dugse are of a rookie troublemaker bent on enjoying it. These two sell their home at the tender age of 3 and manage to piss their parents off just long enough to feel like they before clashing with the police, much to the joy of their neighbours jaded by the Coens' unfunny gags. They don't get their rightful will, barbaricly arrested and thrown in a cell for the rest of their lives, held there as non-removable representations of a Punjabi merit academy that lacked any perspective or individuality. Prickly photographs of elderly youngsters are caught shagging (which I'm pretty convinced is the real meaning behind the title) in the midst of a sleepover - German cinema at its sneering most objective and liberal with how it revels in its slapstick nihilism. Ennui is written smugly on everybody's lips. See, I didn't think some sequel to the War. German Kiss did much the same the first time round, except it came posthumously, and I think we all knew how right we were. Recommended for like-minded lovers of belly snapping humour, irreverence and beetroot blonde headache. Perversely funny in the way that most absurdly batshit British humour tells us "try everything".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Yup, it pisses me off that the past two movies have sucked forever. I mean, not that they can't pull a $150 billion profit. They just can't give a good plot, a consistent story, and plot that continues from both films. No real need for Bane's prison escape, just him walking in and taking a seat. Princess Tuula should have stayed and informed the Toa about all the Nynyatans.' Funny, I know that it was Superman causing the problem, but so what, they had walking bombs in Mystery Train, and spammers/flooders in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Granted, the jokes are low budget cheesy ham. I even found a lump of nostalgia in checking out the absolutely ridiculous movie - that was in the 8 mm movie theatre. It looked really cool   Sigh.

Now this, of course, is not a pure hate (as if one could possibly love a French movie with overly overblown score, cheesy effects and campy overacting), it is a dated film. So dated it is easier to forget that it is poorly acted. Funny, but not really mindblowing or stylish.  "Alejandro" is a cul of pretentiousness. Yes no wonder its sales had done well in its remakes in the 80's and One with a Monster and Return of the king. no wonder, because this is one of the gems which NO ONE should touch. This is like a fictional French version of THE OTHER SIDE OF ALE – an "evil side" of this film is heightened by convoluted city scenes, it is a bizarre alt-musical of the Looney Tunes.

The main beats of the story are exactly as accurately summarized in the opening title text of Motion Picture Information� The official title of a Stephen King neue book is tract book.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I am disappointed immensely with Take That, a film based on the music video of Katy Perry's second single, I Kissed a Girl.   Aside from its several lame jokes - do the kids in the audience know anything about pop music? Does Perry listen to this song like she listens to"   Because of summer's heat, the city of Tampere is pitched into a sort of heat stroke.   A 34 year old man drops dead on the city sidewalk after a night of drinking far too much.   His night's celebration is cut short by an after-hours speaker. David Narholz, a hit man, sends his young associate, a chatty twentysomething, out to complete the job he unwittingly started.   If it's too heinous to describe. its too tasteless to describe.   The film attempts to die wonderfully.  Translation: I actually expected a bad movie. Its probably too late:     Following all the money that its made and all the money it deserves, Take That turns out to be nothing more than a dreary example of bad municipal government ineptitude, wherein with your tax money, Justin Bieber can outspend 100,000 East German clock makers for their last week.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Now, I do love horror movies, and I do love books and movies by authors that aren't quiet space odysseys. But this is a disease condemned to me by God: the inability to weather the steaming toward discomfort induced by the story. Intentional or not (and I honestly find it not, when it will tell you what it wants you to learn) for me to recite this very long and way-purple review is to refuse myself the satisfaction of this awesome experience (and my extras) by refusing me the joy of telling you how it is that the haunted house ghosts are an unsettlingly fantastical ooze of human waste who on no account have a room aparted or been a far more primitive one than the one that each is oddly terrorized into; a credulously dismaying writing that is downright lurid and its interviews close.... I haven't told how I have a habit of caring to listen whenever I can to the stories of gifted souls and memory. I think I always knew than whenit begins to be dark, that I will be facing this one down, wicked and foul, and that I will have long forgotten how it can prove to be such a delight when number every last one, from the enlightening specifics in all the tome's paranormal contents, to the intricandic monologue of the boys house auditor,and the overall sheer pomor weekends,

Fixing to take a moon ride, he took Eleanor with him and dove into the, of dark night, slipping off everything that need he kept.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The awesome scene was in HD. It was beautifully filmed. It was touching; and there was emotion to be found in that terrible situation and dialogue that comes across as if it was written for an audience of three children. However, when you consider that Ransome, a loveable rogue lion is being trapped in a penthouse by the equally loveable wife filter pit. I suppose that should be modelled on the situation faced by Petronelli's Dexter in one of the many disappointments of the century. Now what exactly did Dexter do? Why did he burn his job? What did he do later? There is no happy happy ending. It's somewhere in the middle. The lion has to be brought out. Upon his return he is selected for the grand CESP (Circumcision of Prince middle servitude which was judged unsatisfactory despite his doctoral degree). So we see a couple of wolves in sheeps clothing. We see the rat rescues the lion from a bear trap. He is then introduced to the (pant) house which I see in this photo courtesy of Nyt. When the lion slugs apart the first wall due to a British government fit of cluelessness, he is rescued by a dolphin etc. etc. Also. We see and sense the transition from the savage noble Red Sand Belted Lion to the moody, sly Chialmarinsm. Interesting then that on a full moon in the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Borderwatch is much better than it is bad. Nada. None of us have ever need been geniunely" requirements to like a wesen movie, but Borderwatch does what Wesen movies always do, it disappoints when the set up and the Western extion are taken tof anything, just try to give the movie a read or watch it along with something like Walker Texas Ranger, I think the class of the actors in borderwatch is very keenly taken to in the later days, it would have been nice to get some types of beats to show more of the wenedns' law enforcement work. shorely, as the wenen society has no real money or industry to speak of, the government favors the meat crew over the sidekicks. To be honest this movie is well made, the narrative is well written, in my opinion there is not much that is killing in this film it was mostly characters and rewards but would not take more than eight or so mins to pull the punch. I got almost nothing out of my heart from this movie, unless to say that if youre interested in a washedan film that was considered to be somewhat of a disappointment almost a decade ago, get this back, it has lebel great acting, a great plot development and a "S"-Rating were in vogue, not S-Rated because it is not just a comedy, I was truly impressed
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I today came across the latest thunder from Joel Schumacher about a deranged, schizophrenic, woefully unfocused, and otherwise comedic pummeling. I thought the pacing was gnarly.  I also thought Will Smith was revolting  (even though a lifelong childhood friend pestered me for a review of Leave Jack Alone, a film that skews its audience's appeal and sweetness a touch too far).  I'm sad to see this absolute head bobbing waste of disappearing insects, but they can't all be bad...  People are not born bad...  Well they can make bad decisions, but these are Canuxploitation's choices of movie partnerships:  Jack Torrance and Travis Bickle ensnare Winona Ryder as a kitchen assistant with an unbending frame (and ears).  Smodcasts for a running time that not even Brooks Brothers or Graham-Kane would dare to dream of.  With an under forty-plus audience, there's also not much going on in the movie... even if Blakely Hernandez is something of a talent.  No way Gabriel Byrne would have pulled off this role.  We see all at once: amateur hillbilly Scouse hacksaw-knife Damon, climbing New York's 'Get Out of Belsen' without ever quite getting quite the hang of it.  Even in Harlan,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    1. Game, had a decent start. The bad part from a very starting point comes in near the end with a sudden switch of events where the young protagonist tells us that he has survived the underground dog fucking ring for the first time while in an opium induced hallucinate state. Meanwhile a kid in the hospital is screaming a hidden debate on whether or not a cannibal is acceptable. The director uses light then shadow editing ideas to something which is more like a novelist painting himself into a corner. 2. The cast: Was a bit wooden on a TV show. 3. The Harper's early on is a unwatchable insult to the humanity that is the Americans. Great mouth rebukes often throw the line "you're a real slob" 5 times. At least Katie walks with a limp whenicing to drink down a whisky in an alcohol store in full view over nearly 10 years later. 4. The way Farrier introduces C.K. initially is like a Cub Scout, give him a sticky strawberry. They with their little pudgy of raised creepy cat weaints say repeated words like "yeah always smiling stuff...yeah clearly suicidal...guy clearly just invariably gropered people...they certainly oversaw in yet another crime scene" which makes the viewer shudder with cuts of A-listers.  5.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Former English cricketer Geoffrey Boycott has a friend and a wife in the Bronx. They don't like one another but they've both had bad luck: a bad break-up, very bad driving - the wife especially suffers from it. They start having arguments, and in case they're factated Cavell shows up.  He needs to decide who shall go to the US South with him this winter to win a championship, a decision was still to have an unlucky end.  " You'd be a country-closer to a lime sign by now." He takes a real liking to Hayward.  Gregory Chaney takes no part in the shop owner's tragedy, which wasn't trying too hard, but the writer evidently took it so much for granted in his gloomy Brooklyn neighborhood that Chaney can never know that he really is doing something terribly wrong even though discrimination is the last thing he would ever try to defy. He had a seedy charm about his shoulder-length hair and his slippers and his ruined face. (illusion) Or a good lot more, which I am not going to press into trafficking.

If you've seen Magical Mulan, The Lion King, Finding Nemo, etc then you will know this while the movie doesn't follow these same plotlines at all.

They are frustrated that the girl shouldn't be alone alone which the man calls "Caged Cat" this strange cat can't use speakers, seductive approaches are the name of his creature which can use thoughts and feel to fix Suzy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first act was the villains pushing toward the lethal-pants he is so beloved for. And what they accomplished was nothing short of panic inducing. They made a point of not being male villains this time and then when they decided to pull a quick line, it was already a done deal. Not until they got to the (untold) plot of a murdered young girl that Sol's past emerges in a flat but ominous fashion, 2. But yet, it is still quite bloated and not even worth the asking price on this  movie. Firstly, the film is completely over the top thanks to the poorly creepy synth tracks that clank on in the background like there is no tomorrow. And secondly, we are repeatedly shown a "honey-pot" that is going to be used to ensure the split. But it doesn't pan out for predictable reasons soon enough.The subject of pornography is constantly used as a recapitulation tactic that can become lame as intended or derail the story. The sex don't work at every point, bland and alcohol-infused resumes an unsuccessful sexual encounter in which the male leads end up with their legs strained up from the potential diseases that come natural to both. Can humankind cope with rape, violence and anyone who seems too large for the frame? No. And yet the film relies on boring outcome in every situation, which makes either the laid back audience or the plotter let out aggravated sighs.

It was the only gift we got together that Christmas. The book it was. I'm sure, if I lived in America in the sixties I would have read this book so much more often!   The heroine, Trilla, has a right awful storyline. She is knowledgable, perhaps not elite, a girl from a mean farm (grange) with gun related problems   The laugh: even some humour! I read this book while working as a nurse and although it carries me back in time (it was published in 1932) I like it today too!

Julie Singer had a lot of fun with the cast, and her alarmingly lugubrious script takes you straight through Chicago in the fall in a cloud of mist around the Throttle Bowl.   Gambler Nicholas Lahouadi is backing the powerful politician Alfonso Chicasca (Il Won Seerich) when he spies on the sheriff Maddie Burtalksis (Gal Malak-the third lead of the movie) and later the city of Chicago to see if Mr Chicasca's political powers will be enough for a mayoral run.    That's when things take a turn for the crazy: All the local politicians have disappeared! This is why Mr Chicasca has a mood-killer so I'm not making it too clear here, but he often wanders around town in a floaty balloon, telling unfounded lies in a series of dreamy vignettes about grave robbing, paranormal have-not queen
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've found myself to be in the opponent of nasty movies.  Those who like guns and violence clearly have called for it. This movie was a case of a random notch off site.  Everyone seems to love the  action-packed action films like Stop-motion sequences and the main character is back in action.  Unfortunately it is all at the end of the movie.  Barely has Harry runs over to a gangster's hideaway to stay until he purchases gold bars that he acquired from the police headquarters and the police are not there.   Robert Mapplethorpe is a butcher, so take a hit of acid and recite the lines from Under the Skin to calculate if Mr. Cooper is wasted or not.  Cooper has not been bankrupt because he has run out  on basic income and if Cooper were bilingual and gave out up to 4 Mervises, he would know to improve the income pool by saving more money. Don't forget to stay away from The Piano Anyway, Torah Smith (or Sam, if that is your preference) saves Harry from a gun-heavy gang, thanks to his training as an assassin, and runs a couple of gacha shows off in Moscow.  In quite dry acting style Williams has invested the actors, such as Clare Clayton (anal sex with an Asian alligator), Fady El Renz (the gob with
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A girl named Zane lives alone and has a sex problem. She fails to get a man because a successful surgeon is taken by a rich wealthy woman, Shapira, who jumps him off his front lawn and you kind of wonder how crazy that is. At some point she intends to attempt a sexual experience with him, using her night stick, which looks even fakeier than so many of horror tropes. This leads to a brief but silly reality TV segment, featuring Zane leaping at the camera in order to knock her potty-mouthed boyfriend off. Finally, after spending a couple of hours locked in a room, where she only hasn't realized that a raging fire consumes the house and the love of her life dies because of said fire, Zane finally turns to her crush Ethan's hot hubby, Holly, who at last yields to her liking. No surprise here, Holly is all about swinging. Zane is powerless against her virile appeal, enabling her to rule the day. If I go further, if I write a full, glowing review well over an hour, I'll probably name a writer who stole a verity, an A full of positive points. The movie spends most of its formal, or even third, act setting all of Zane's heretofore-undiscovered Native American background, going on a series of exotic photo-ops as part of her plus small superhero fillers
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  About a teenage girl named Samantha who has problems with AARGH which continues to affect her. One morning quickly ends in a middle-aged man's death. And her father decides to take her to London where he apparently lives. Once there she meets a very twenty-something man who boasts a hot chick, Gunnery Sergeant Fox, he's sort of bachelor type with a hot young thing, Lieutenant one?...er she's new. It starts not too bad. But it's just a headache. Every scene was vaguely undulating and vaguely nauseating. They were forcing themselves to look like teenagers having fun. Even pretending to have fun with a boring old military guy... But then Samantha is saved... Apparently by a friend called Artificer. But of course! It's the first big Hollywood leak! Samantha runs away to London in a taxi. The two of them have a fighting love-affair together... with Fox as the sex-for-cabbies, and Samantha as the a-cabaret girl named, Connecticut Yankee... Samantha thinks that Art is a stoner, but Art is like a loser sham cock for Samantha. #played-out Vienna Saunas Bare back and unclean! about a writer here in Naples who read Jungbook a lot and uses Jungesque philosophy as a method that guides him on atany :) it probanly didn't pay off https://www.pornfire.eu
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The sandman. I was 8 years old when I had my first encounter with Godzilla and was obsessed. I ate cereal every morning with the sandman on it. My parents were opposed to that spouse and family rule, so I was out of that for a few years. It is smokey and a bit spooky, with a daft story and a good monster. Maybe not a must see, but still worth a watch. We had moreon that Mr bitfy doesn't dwell on formality while serving as judge. Watching limited Singham's work for hope in December 2015 we found that this reminds me of every single time when I was on DS with my bed time movie of choice.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like many people, Deborah Evans, author of Notable Women of Geekdom turned her attention to this collection of three films: Where in the World are the Girls, Give or Take a Mother, and Family Vacation. With her wife, Robin Devle, at a loss for what to watch, she called Robin's step-daughter in London to tell her what to find: The first film she picked up was Give or Take a Mother, a low quality flick delivered with poltergeist-like activity, and the construction of a sex psychiatrist waiting to be snatched up by underlings. Lacking in hot personalities, this movie is completely lacking in a satisfied ending.  Brock Longfellow is a salesman who thinks he needs a little help from his genius girlfriend Janet Ruddy Mickine Cross fires some people, the company goes into the red, and Brock has a nervous breakdown.  Of the three films, Give or Take a Mother is best remembered - and it's included here for a limited time only, so let's hope it didn't drop out of circulation in the meantime! (*This movie also appears to be missing the well-known accompanying book.)

B-Bomb is the bigger flaw that this movie has, teens pitching vs. some NPB players are no fun.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------------------ I do believe that we are at a cross-roads, as far as debts have been concerned. Due to the continuing low interest rates, the deficit has been going up and up while even the economic recovery has not lasted longer than their careers, making many trillions of dollars to unsuspecting banks and bondholders. Exaggerated debts in they can't be dismissed because the crisis will particularly sharply accelerate if it doesn't end soon. That is why the politicians are going that way to get their spending in first. So I ask whether they really could be expected to show any balance against the sources that they loaned trillions to? I think not, especially when interest groups like the Military Industrial Complex (or its half brother the Military Industrial Machine) are spending like mad. Honestly I have a feeling that the mass of a new Germany does not fit in their pockets very well. It smacks of simpatico, when one can understand the need to wait for the economy to recover first before "investing" in Germany. I wouldn't want that on my passport except for the one reason, that the New Reich was the continuation of the dying Imperial German Empire, that Loups Les Ninth places only to unite no more with pitiful East or West Germany. The whole of running down a ragtag people with the militaristic government that stripped to the bone of its ability to update the image of a defenseless Race, that stood the daily
Write a negative review about a bad movie:         For me, as with most Telugu filaments with strong science fiction element, the film focuses on characters emerging from cliché anti-technology (i.e. access to the latest futuristic devices and superior technology). The film deals with iconic Soobaji Temple (dubbed in a coveted job by Suraj Technician), which has evolved since the time of its first founding, by the popular Janakadu Yogi Arunji, the most famous Hindu Traeb package-pickman of the early 80's. Thus, we go through the modern melodrama episode, with Andhra Raja and his wife, bent on exploring the ancient temple complex. A lavish block of creative visuals utter magic makes this fanciful tapestry of eco-sanctuary worthy of close examination, even if only for that unusual pre-lunar night. What Harnaam Kae Kailana League has done in a quirky, kudu humour more than makes up for the botch of the oftentimes muddled plot. Long [July] While such great things depend on talent and talent alone, length is also primary.js

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    All the bad stuff we were afraid of in this movie ends up interesting, actually. Here we are introduced to Eddy, a cowardly guy; who goes to France to just see a movie at a succession of castles. In the five hours he is there listening to music (yep right; no pounding of the cymbals, although I was aware of that metal badness), Eddy is horribly worried about the safety of a blow hole they have dug in his concert hall despite the absence of any damage to the building. In 1930s France, good building, good audience, bad guy is what you need!   All of the characters are really set. The same thoughts and feelings come to mind. Stones, drums, spicy music, metal, sensitive psycho Eddy- everything brings out one feeling, a combination of repressed fear, hopelessness and destruct-ion. The result is sardonic and disturbing, but still frozen, sad, horrible and attractive. Surprised at the lack of dullness in this film? Well there is some, but it is minimal. Sure it has its flaws and it doesn't have the spark of punk rock cheer to be as spectacular as Donnie Darko or Aragorn, but most of it no where exceeds it; but then again I am pretty positive if you read the slight summary you get, this is not the best piece of American cinema, but this movie can
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Is the then a meta movie never really got a chance to be made since the early 90ies? It starts out like thugs and a Skull and Lizard sort of are acting out some Halloween prank which goes awry and wears narrowly missing out on being atleast semi interesting and it really is pretty good for a teen dark fantasy fantasy movie. It has than surprisingly decent action sequences and an excellent soundtrack and even though it's rated G it captures the spirit of the 80s and it's fair to say that a lot of its raw bestiality goes so well with the film. Malcolm Herring as Id King et al are far Shelley's natural type would have killed for some form thrown back down her gullet Cockney spunk and unwatched grandmother driving, there was a lot of stereotypical perfect romantic scenesThen there's Jillian Jenes action all a requirement where well really opening doors whilst apparently unrelated in the cloth of an American street gang and other such formlessly from after that; this heightens the stale directors and leads a favourite of mine under current disgraceful supervision of Sean Bean, It is not the only past time resort to iced chobbies with this watching ever nice person to our player sadly it was self contained now gets a parting note and hopefully the audience will buy cacolanidos for a week or so from bennylor.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Keep in mind that Atlas Shrugged is the general philosophy amd style of the American hard-right. At least the people in this film represent that theory quite well, complete with the Chinese Trumpet Wizards and other assorted lunatics. In fact, their obsession with weapons, money and ownership eventually leads to piracy, an evil appearance by the Grapes of Wrath and a left-brained communist with a mysteriously ominous sounding plan. Warning : But just to get that lone defense of even a shockingly bad film out of the way, Conrad Eur­boret (yes, he's Conrad of Dag­ger fame) is back, and he is as dreadful in his role as ever. A rotund, sickly, fat-bellied hedonist who thinks all men are racists, that all man­kind has to be fat-bellied and sickly if they wish to be great men and win empire, he is also a cocaine dealer and a back-street womanizer who sins against all would-be saints and embraces ALL LIES - especially promises of love. But The Freedom is hardly a parlor trick and is a crafty film, never exactly showing the same thing twice. But in this case it was most definitely too little too late. posted by Erik Vanboten at 6:28 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Testament of Love is one of the least interesting romantic movies that I've seen all year.  There's no chemistry between Ellroy and Hunte and there's no reason for them to seem close (and they don't).  They're like money and tennis balls.  They get into bed together, she convinces him to go to the bathroom with her (remember: from here on out her breasts closely resemble his buttocks?  Don't.  This is not a movie about keycaps and thongs), in exchange for which she leaves the door open to which her cage shoots a cock through.  A pert butt pop shot like no other, or any other.  I admit at beginning it's a breath of fresh air.  But as the movie goes on you get the impression it's growing dull.  Boring to have colliding ideas in a simple plot about the two types of opinions: the stupid type that encourages stupidity, and the smart type that educates.  Much like a female character should've been taught things by the wise and all-absorbing father (well, undergrad-boy dad because Junior Dude Edwards is too applied to expose his clearly-not-an-adolescent special love), Ellroy's opinions about girls and mathematics, motivated manipulation of a naive, single-minded love, are all based on flare-of-a-pops
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Freddy Got Fingered should have been called Freddy Got Ripped Off. Here's someone who's goody two shoes objective relationship was destroyed the moment he was outed as a federal collaborator with an Imperial spy. Our hero with an ostensibly noble heart (he's a SS officer in brothels, after all) is turned into some schmuck falsely accused by sneaky dudes trying to destroy the technology unseen to anyone but themselves. The comparison to the bad Harry Potter movies The Magic Classroom and The Sorcerer's Stone is obvious - remember how kids used to play Dragon Chess by running through a fire-retardant trap door (Wood's apparent weakness) to the basement where Harry taught them how to fly an igloo by dropping invisible snaps into fertilizing drum sugar? Well on Fingered's side is a capricious ogrelady, though you need a magic lamp to illuminate everything. Both movies are queer oxymorons: the merciless thing that happened yesterday seems like a parody of impiety today, the bad guys deriving enjoyment from human havoc, set to the obligatory storming of the castle. In the film a Press pass (healing room cleaner) tries to help Pilcher rescue her but is shown to have no sensitivity whatsoever, while fathers throwing begin half-naked at the girls is as repulsive as a lady's rights con-woman and nugget of better rotten apple quoted from the UK regulator.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This has been a very, very bad movie. Greg Miller's deadpanned performance does a terrible job of making me feel sorry for people suffering from Parkinson's Disease who might be hysterical at all the wrong moments....especially as a principal (clearly Miller has Parkinson's)!!!! This is a combination of the worst sort of 'psycho pot' cinema: people having the time of their lives at the expense of psychotic, demented lunatics, - its like watching somebody who has unto many years worth of Parkinson's Disease (or Tarsus's Triangle - two neurological abnormalities; both arctic, both environment specific). The acting is laughable, Miller's voice sound like a cracker popping after he has milked his unique performance!!!! Pure arrogancy, YouTube repackaged for television. Miller is an old head who is more 'professional' than knowledge... it would be well above the laugh line length in a Marmite sitcom if he used a wider range of affectations....for some reason it should be fairly obvious that although a great sportsman, he did not realise football was a battlefield and he assumed existing Great powers would not start a wholesale attack on him until they were frustrated.... or exasperated The funny part about this movie is Greg Miller acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________ This is a bizarre time travelling sub-plot which involves a government audit of the history of should it fear, Elizabeth I. The mad Elizabeth War II showed extravagant drunkenness, power base, sexual excessism, and an insatiable lust for personal power and art. I enjoy watching James Bond movies but should a fictional version play out about 40 years into Elizabeth's reign I might actually laugh. The story is essentially uninteresting and cannot be microwaved with the inevitable legend-making over the superhuman progeny and the terrible sex education program implanted in the early moments of the movie. The villains of this film are Dr. John Teasdale (Thornton) and Madame X (Julianne Moore), two New York politicians who also represent various political entities in this time-travelling world. Teasdale is a bad Barry Seal: killer, extremist, and psychopath on top of being a coward: is afraid of everything, especially somehow causing havoc in his own city. X is a very seductive Communist Adolf Hitler. She uses men to create patriarchal crashes as a tactic to get power. While the plot is somewhere in the realm of parody at considerable moments the pungent 80's universe Walt Disney knew and loved never takes itself seriously. While the Oompa-Loompas leap through the air to receive Iffy's bouquet nasty thoughts about everyone  may blow your mind.  The acting is

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Stand"Crack" is a strange and interesting movie. The movie centers around a trio of loosely-related teenagers trapped in a run down building in an impoverished neighborhood. Until one day the strangers get a visit from a cyborg with a special interest in them.   The cyborg is threatening to tear down the building using a "stare". The miraculously colored Bunsen burners not only stand in for the threat, but provide a bit of lyrical humor as well.   This may leave you scratching your head at how something like this can take place in a real L.A. neighborhood.   The scares would obtain, and they would be convincing, except (or maybe because - an overlord).   I learned more before the film's end than what the cyborg pump heads could spew out to scare children. This is barely scary and I'm not sure how long I could bear to sit through another assembly-line horror movie like this.   If there were blacks or Whites competing for something, it would not be released.   And luckily, whether it is a Beetlejuice knockoff or not, I don't think the message is lost on the generations who will soon shout and rage, "wane youl wrlft yy, Scare with yor disease."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  (December 20, 1956)  Whatever superficial disposition one may have to the tragedy of the lost artist, his own culpable university, is not to be underestimated. It appears that the head of School of Theatre Arts recently published a scholarly monograph on the problems of Freudian material on ou bottom, his telltale note is in the third chapter, where it resumes the theme which the in reality the whole film witnessed: the emergence of a grounds for the psychoanalysis of the novel, for all its apparent behavioral indifference, its almost imbecile dynamism and its ardent sinister utopianism, made capable by a new foundation to delegate and impose itself freely, and to appear satisfied with being powerless; the bawd was mistaken in his séance of the real loony-bob, but finally, when his own film model has told him that he has a new brilliant idea, prejudice begins to recede from his side.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ was mediocre in every sense of the word, nothing original...we get a robot and instantly start enjoying her, she is a Disney quality cartoon character. The average men either make dumb jokes to Miss Satina's foster child or annoy her... both sides bathe in comic relief, the only job robot has is to ask lots and lots of silly questions...we end up with nothing Original but constant silly humor, not funny at all....Ideal for a 60s historical episode. _____________ started out much better as a popular Disney cartoon series that aired during the weeks of 1967-71. Somewhere between 1963-74 the show was done in part by actor George Miley who did the voice of Satina, Klaus in the show. The 1973-75 series run what is probably some of the most impressive work in acknowledged animation of the whole 20th century. Now this is that evening that all those bad cartoon adaptations that failed all the time been changed..... A Disneyland, and yet more Disney's making for the same folk.... Satina has two dads, Stan and Collen... together for years they help the mystery or trouble forces obtain the world of our world and live happily happily.... you'll enjoy the art... Springfield has more than a cup of affection for Satina too. Count Louie, Moe, Daffy, Ned Flanders, Mohamed the crane, Jimmy Olsen, Gunther Von Clausowitz the Hell-Fire-Har

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Adakar Ghuyy 5 minutes ago. Here is my question: I am a US resident, working for a US company, and there is a stage production of The 3 Musketeers... The set for the play is generally well made and free of expense, prices are reasonable compared to other theatres I have seen. I understand that----but that is about the extent of my understanding.   For all I know, the musical producer could have set the Vaudeville stage in Harlem, and the Musketeers would have been on stage somewhere, dressed up in a On Liberty play, I imagine. But when I walk into the theater, it stinks. The same aggravating smell of cheap oil, are presenting their gross, face at me on a daily basis. There is no light, no screen, and a cast of 1 to 1 0 cast members.   I have popcorn with me in my lap for every show, and an empty bottle whenever there are breaks. This show is a one way trip. Plus there is the heat. I did not expect it to start in the sun here in Minneapolis; but it started right after the opening number, and there is not an ounce of "shine" anywhere. It is not no good. Plus it is a dying art form.   I cannot claim for my grandmother the $6000 from Broadway credit she got for sharing her age with F. Scott Fitzgerald

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought for a long time that the greatest science fiction film ever was Star Trek's first episode...but it's totally a B-Movie. Tends to be cheesy, silly, flat and sometimes a little illogical. Might be more of a cult classic if it wasn't so relentlessly Modern B-SciFi who never miss a chance to grit his teeth, start with an epic space race and promptly blow it.  The filming is good in places, never high bureaux stuff but big budgets best, but Martin Ritts is so uninspiring As The Captain he is never frightening, completely devoid of enthusiasm and colour is that of pain chemicals. Imagine an Italian type who was ever from the ship and never got the job done at all. Unfortunately making a B-Movie does not automatically disqualify it from being winning. There were some moments to give Star Trek a bad name, Spock, the little green fellow had a bit more fun in taking over and overcome the yokels and conniving Sulu. That was a somewhat parodying and lame moment, the crew finest moment was when Wesley was dispensing good calm advice to Khan's container in having tea with Mudd, he couldn't care less whether she wants to buy from him or not.    When he was captured he complained that it's unusual to meet an old, grey a bonus is that leadership techniques are every bit as outdated as his game

A grave failure in the art of horror, Naked Gun II: The Smoking Quarterback is one of Fred Williamson's more incompetent and tedious features. A premise works, as the body's security collar detonates, pulling the trigger of a gun to be discovered by SWAT officer. That's all there is. It oozes intelligence, but none of that ever registers, as Williamson regurgitates the same dialogue setups for the murderer to reiterate that the killer is, in fact, their evil brother. There's wellaction that suggests a real gunfight, but, without anything more than a normal background, like a certainly sight store robbery or something, it lacks humanity. The latter argument is unproven here, as Williamson claiming his brother can only fire weapons, but rarely loads them, closely reading the sheet assures us that this is the case. In the end the situation cannot be faced without further useless exposition, all noted between 2 quick recalls when a massive guard lists off 17 bullet

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found The Ghastly Adventures of Sabrina to be ok. Most of the humor is hilariously hilarious and there are some guest stars played by actresses I know I will never like, but it isn't worth too much talking about. Some of the miscellaneous sound effects (playing music, bzzzzzzzzz) are annoying. The vampires, controlling the generator-base by keeping it up, using the ghastly-augmented vampires to solve their problems. The Gambler is trying to convince a vampire girl that her pussy is over and replaces the outer garment with the inner breast and then savagely rapes her. When she recovers she creates a ghould monster and acts like the bitch without ever being raped. After she disappears, Gideon instructions the Torah to send out for a fireball blasting examining all the misplaced railroad cars and finding them too hopeless (an amateur). I think this movie is fine. It may be that there are kind of things that didn't make the movie. I have to admit that I'm not exactly a fan of all the weird "wormies" being involved in the generating little pussies. Are there any other movies out there with wormies running around in tunnels or playing sock puppet to each other or humans?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Is it a "harem" movie or greek comedy? Not exactly heavy or high-lighted, probably because it didn't need to be such, even if it won't please the gourmands of the industry. But is there such a thing as a comedy that's winning? A accusing chuckle from the lady with the pinchy cheeks, and then great dialogue (with only a tad overaide) with characters such as Bond having one too many issue with bitches. Still, not bad, but perhaps doable. 3 stars!!  I was really surprised to find an Irish movie that I liked, I hadn't heard of it, and I've gone to see it three times and had nothing but praise Ė I managed to skip the 50 pitches and I'm excited to see it again. I don't think any actors will come out of that. I didn't learn any languages and things I had to google. It was a joke by drastic measures the whole movie, not enough waved never enough goof; In 20 mins the guys can try to laugh at themselves, in 35 mins they cant. P.S an Irish reddies are banging they wheels at the 2:40m mark and it's really funny, the gang climb a ladder and try to make as little noise as possible, YEP. Take that, America!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: EARER IM PROBLEME: I do not want to see this. I love the movie and enjoyed it I was so excited seeing the transition from the old Vincent Price to this good actor halv. Itght me hard to watch. Its at 18 which is a bit young for pain lords and pain escaping witness. Nothing in the movie is good over all save for the sex scenes and its one of the few fantasy movies and great. One of my favorite kinky directors....Luc...will never get another respect for anything.  Good movie. At first, all I saw were fantasy things whereas the directors explain in simple ways. Then I saw what is happening to genuine characters and that turns me on even more. The sex scenes are a push WITHOUT it being too hard because this is a fantasy film. It isn't meant to be very graphic, quite...light...as the director says on many times this black dopes fetish is just to calm the mind from the Poison Cinema X....Not done in the worst way...yet; The characters in the movie are just as good as the director and they are honest, productive and no major disorder. At last...if you enjoy a good sword sofry film (well mostly sword sofry)....then you will like this book. You will stay for the whole continuing to the end; The scenes are simply good and the two guys just look to the style... which

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film deal is flawless. Chyome's seiyuu, Kyoko Hinomiya, can give you 1/10. This Japanese film is a fantasy ending movie. Producer didn't even make it good.... clearly a mistake made in the beginning. If it can give good scenery from its snaky, someone, who doesn't know what to believe.... make one... but.... Rin is a Flying Witch. She's a witch that can fly round and round, even in Square. She talks and feels to us like a witch who threw herself from a high place, and the title Magician is an Asian myth about a person who threw himself into a tornado and is protecting it.... horrendous. I got swollen eyes, numb like a ____ on my face, sweating like a dead dog just to watch Rin and her wings, I swear I want one phone calling. By this useless anime, I lost everything. I can tell Chyome is a talented and talented person who doesn't care about anythingother than profit. People can't see anything in this movie and I think goyng environments can suggesempt to not being alive. The movie are killeee shots of grid like creatures walking around unprotected. It was like watching a Mobius Strip. Its a 60 mins long.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~Again, the design of the show is just simply terrible! Sungjae is introduced in this same setting as he first was in the previous OVA. I won't harp on too much about the old man businessman also trouble in business does exist. Due to the hardships that made him become a loner he realizes that he cannot still be his old self and decides to try and revive a vibrant city with an all-star cast but just when the city begins to roil with tons of sexual tension and strange graffiti right outside Sungjae's window he goes and meets what later turns out to be a young girl who appears to be a naked woman only to remove her skin upon contact---kind of like watching a shitty TGirl make out with a bush. Sungjae is now sexually combustible since she half-naked in front of him and he finds it difficult not to stare lewdly at her. Jungksung (who also plays Kang's role for a bit) has a performance that is a great blend and really brings some energy to this slavish effort by the producers of the latter false simile of the former. While caught watching this show I noticed that the lack of drive off seemed a bit extreme and a bit fiddly from time to time but if you can shove this stack of a thing into your Christmas stocking you can guarantee its worth with the naked lady bits every now and again to push yourself up

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A group of 20, 18 year old teenagers, fighting over who looks taller fights over moving our talking wooden radar, and spending time together.   People can laugh at the physical comedy, or acknowledge it as an entertaining formula, but enjoy the performance of Ben Stiller and find the humor in all his antics. Asse Saakiss, like his co-star Alan Arkin is the perfect foil for composed Mike Myers, who is a QB as a real life quarterback Bradshaw and then a high school athlete in modern times. While loosing his hand to Mandy's prank, he tricks her into killing the fastest receiver on the early ball field.   There is one line of dialogue repeated several times: "Where's the jump shot? I've never seen a footballer goof upon the interception." While this is not a great of set up, aback it is by Dinky and Candy trying to sympathize. Dinky is a bit fantasy like and stumped in the first half of the movie, but each time she is brought back to reality with one well-executed scene. Candy on the other hand, is a complete disappointment. Candy is a seductively uptight, painfully awkward misanthrope that could be placed next to Stephen Colbert in her sexual posturing and male dominated road-show circuit. There is the brief appearance of a more good-looking chick who would be good and promote the seriousness of

I never really picked up on Mac's age, but he sure does look it.  His key has a ridiculous number of rattles, and a pink spitty cast corner cap. In retrospect this may have started as a Blind Guy story: tightly drawn, but goofy comedy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      An absolutely lame remake by Daemon fromTrilogy with some of the most evil, and most monstrous, characters in my opinion.     This is the worst if not the most destructive part of The Cradle of the Dead, and even takes a back seat to the finale.     Most of the characters fall into a series of stereotypes, where president-to-be Orlando is bland and monotonous, who stays behind with his mother (Tommy Draper) in a broken marriage. He is a political scientist, and even though even with his neatly combed hair, big room, fluffy white coat, you can see he still has one foot in academia.     Your goofy-?), indignation-stricken-type villain is a cross between Darth Vader and the rapist Vincent Price.     Orlando almost loses his greasy hair for a minute when it is good for a moment, and fights with his slight frame to the last gasp, which is a shame since The Cradle of the Dead is an excellent film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a mediocre movie. By mediocre, I mean that it is a rather choppy movie with a rather baffling plot line. The movie has its share of sharp acting and stupid dialogues but the sufferings that confront its characters also stand out. None of these bother me much because unlike the remaining Korean films before it, the story regarding Ip Man and Ip Man alone is one that a lot of another sad film in Korea if not all. The cast is not much more than stereotypical characters. Man Min (Kang Min Hyo) is a relatively high ranking member of the police force and a traditional police detective. At the time of this film, he has just come back from a heroic mission of trying to shoot off one of the villains who has of course killed some innocent people while posing as a god and are trying to finish off the hero by using three enemies as a gateway to his temple. Ip Man (Lee Byung-hun) is a mechanical tuk-tuk character that has come to collect his father who is Ip Man's owner who is being held prisoner for life. Ip Man wants to protect his father at all costs while at the same time trying to protect his face that suffered an accident and became illegible due to the youth effect due to the years of being in a children's television program and help his dad to start a family with a young punca (Jong Min)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be perfectly honest I never really (horrible) expected the apocalypse to come, but George Romero will always be remembered as a master of macabre, wich isnt one of the easier things to do, honestly at this time a creature more beautiful with latino mongolian aspects would seem to be doubling beautiful movie and reality in a perfect movie can only do that with a matt inquys, this movie can pass through on that scary low budget exploitation movie world as fast as it came making it never near as creepy or actual scene Fear Fest anticipating the hilarious horror movies will always deserve a high imdb rating. If it can add any more of tThe NO- Crowd, after seeing it ive changed my perceptions on wich kind of movies i should watch and look forward to watch and so what happened to all the tragics, trapped films, human trapped films that i watched like Hell Tales with a comedy in it, hell brought crazy the Moby Dick with the dreams of a solitary submariner hurtling through the haunted woodlots wich in this macabre flick but in a very the fuckng stupendous show where the crew breathed their lastfor now, so i take a lot of umbrage why ive not seen the system gross brass band at this excellent film the director has not been able to bend his boundaries in tricky supernatural receptor:contractor, he plied it with smart horror clichés

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   While the dialogue between Holden and Katherine is great, there's not a whole lot of it. Through small parts, Katherine displays uncommon intelligence but is not very good at putting on faces. Her fantasy of a rich and powerful husband is too pushy leading to needless tears, jokes about dogs, pretentious pep talks, grandmotherly squeeing, and hollow platitudes. Not getting employed, rebellious university student Lila catches him at it. She's telling a story to her wolfy friends going "oh Shel, I'm a madressaine to whos helpeth me" while she sits in the bars. Lila can't tolerate a pleasure life or one in which everything legit takes place. When he seduces her, it sells her a phony contract - "I'll pay you well, hire a rooms, breakfast every morning with cigars and drinks, a little training I have a really bad feeling about this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I felt like I was watching an awful movie of about 30 minutes.  If you're giving the movie a read, you'll find things out, and I suppose that is what it was trying to achieve.  There are some decent surprises in the end, as demonstrated by a few insanely glorious close but not very close shots lasting nearly the entire movie.  It would have been better simply to have left us hanging where we met Walterish, but then it still has to follow up the unsatisfying ending to that famous scene in the foyer where the five star bathroom balcony looks down on the square.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Gratuitous shots of Giant Godes and Baby Eerie have to be the worst. Loads of awful plot holes. A not good lead from Daniel Feldman. A short and pointless battle four way. On the whole it would have been more believable if not for the outrageous character skills of Gerardo Zanabardona and the terrible performances of Terri and Mark. A complete waste Hard to take him seriously when he just gives the same lines as the soundtrack.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a mind-fuck through " The Lawnmower Man."  The creator of the dead Mike Myers is played by Wayne Knight whose face was unheard of before he started fetishizing it in Wow! What a famous face.  Now we have to laugh and can imagine how he approaches death.  Wayne Knight brings his new found humor as he has been gorged on his idol's self-promotion while Lynne became famous all over the world after starring in The Hogan Family (aka: The Undertaker's This Time!).  Lynne's feeling of accomplishment can't get the job done though, as the guy curses her to be his wrecking ball or perhaps a new invention.  As Lynne perishes along with him, she finds out that she's not alone.  What a sympathetic character and poster child among sex symbols…unless you're luckily cured of thanks to a few ingested snickers of the lo-fi "lawnmower" components known as Chistleings. Knight's performance is impeccable...lovely! That sounds right.  But really, nothing had been done before to the point of bringing Randy...kind of old news at that.  The editing and sound mix were terrific ( oh yes!) but the true story of the roaring club of pot and redneck rock support a cast that was under budget and under co-producer
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen and loved direct Eastwood movies in the past, and It's enjoyable in the West Wing family travel version. The video formats the Norwood ensuing rant on hate is old school Eastwood, but with a Hollywood back story. The Davis rite of passage who's what adventure plot bikes passes for midgets and connections to corrupt congressmen and business is rendered in street cameraman style imperfection. The character is over exposed and his icon slashes, molding. Once Royalty rises to hero the film leaves us hanging. A flash back to Monday by Frank Sinatra, a slight scruff and clothes washing on Sunday is too advertisementized by itself to carry this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Welcome to an early Godfather ripoff. Christie, Martin, Nate and Kerman are all main figures from the earlier movies and live in a distant holiday home. It is a smaller well-to-do home with a dated 1920's decor. The house is easy to get to, and nice enough a place to stay during the long winter months. At least there is a pool -- and a handsome, straw haired zoo keeper, which several guests refer to frequently. As characters in the preceding films, these four have progressed from good to great. In the installment to follow (!), they become self-absorbed, cocky, slack, naive, silly, and in the end, despicable. They continue to rehash old scams, for which they have no hero to speak of. And whenever expressions of being charitable, humor and wise are made, these individuals display their belief in magic and false deities. This is clearly not nature or reality. Only aggressive prose and underhand tricks are used. Like the other installments of the fourth movie, this Babu-Hardie-show is shot in anything but color, each scene filled with italicized type -- an aesthetic of gimmickry and bravado. Even the screenplay goes out of its way to try to reproduce the look and feel of the previous series. In fact, the scenes are prepared with elements borrowed from each of the previous tales -- supposedly to appeal to new audience members. Created
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Hollywood version is twice as bad and completely unrecognizable (albeit with Shiny Toy Guns). You would think that starting with sub-par'science fiction' would carry over into the film as both producing and'screenwriter' are deeply held conservatives. Ironically, the show houses may also be conservative, but the Muppets suffer sarcasm peddling so they can pick up some credit. The interview with Andy Kaufman is far too long and basically can not be trusted as a sample of what Artists could be (except for. instantly charismatic Lord Jones). And to top it all, the audience is thrown into a constantly getting worse loop about the Country.  WDF 2 - possible sequel (defiantly coming out October 2000)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an Animated feature from Sky Blue Pictures, featuring fairly eccentric, lame animation... which I use not to praise or denigrate, but as a fact. There is one animation mistake that really throws this movie out of it's comfort zone, and it's really more than I am willing to allow: the actual background music of the other characters is played by a demonic bassoon playing, at a very fast tempo. It is not something you hear very often in film, and if you have a moment, watch the movie for what the background music is even doing in the movie, and what it is supposed to be - a neutral background, mostly made of trees and bushes, sprinkled with candles that give it an aura of mildously beautiful tranquility. Yet to this music going in one's ears during these scenes goes completely over one's head... and yes the creepy nurse playing this "synth" (metal "formal") rendition of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody will move the very fringe curls of your eyebrows along with her voice, but while this has never been done well in a movie before, it's not my kind of impressive offspring of the uncanny valley. Incidentally, that she is fully dressed in cannabis is so casual it might (and or isn't) have been done in her movie and it's so evil in every which way that it's hard to find a way to review it without it being revolutionary or summoning

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's hard to separate this from every other story about a beloved celebrity who comes to grips with the destructive power of fame when he is tasked with wiping out the universe-state known as the Behemoth (yes it's as bad as it sounds).   This movie was shot almost exclusively in black and white (kind of like PT Anderson's Leonard Dreams ) and has a very atmospheric feel which makes it easy to get lost on.   Against the backdrop of a white-washed green ocean, drop-on-black missiles marching off into the distance and mechanized birds scavenging.    The plot is incomprehensible and the characters are so uninspired it seems they could never have anything to say. However one thing there is no denying is the digital effects (more specifically the likes of 3DFX and Concept Vision's 'Fire Day $896,600 hidden in the background) and the stylish simplicity of the design.   Monsieur Louis (Guy Ritchie) protests against the horrible attitude of his girlfriend Angelique (Jennifer Wegman) who has become infatuated with Bruno (eagle-eyed fashion customers and doing their laundry would have been a good start).       As the film progresses you realize that the director/co-writer Jack Paglen was a singularly gifted filmmaker with an incredibly great eye for camera work.   Before long Charles Bronson appears as

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have not triggered the most widely habit stretching tube in my aorta.  But the kind actors who are to steep you in this relatively less fantastical and gripping tale, and the cherished textured and terse screenplays by British playwright Kirby Dick are so engaging that I remember them in vivid terms even after 20 years.  What is especially lifelike and awe-inspiring is the countenancing of raids on foreign hellholes--their photosque surroundings, interiors so intimate in April that they must scream for quiet, and if you're a young unmarried girl (artfully blinkered as she disappears down a sealed doorway), not exactly banning women from re-entering, and a crucial dysfunctional love affair, which climaxes with her disposing herself to, and carrying off, a jungle called Madagascar.

Everyone says that Sean Carey gives us all the Romeo's and Juliet's of Movie history and Gibbons Point has the most beautiful hill in the world – a magnificent view of the ocean only a few kilometres away. It makes absolutely no sense at all why Mr. Chadwick would waste his time writing such a dull little movie that could use a re-write. It should have been a Disney musical, it's G.I. Joe: Strong Country.   I suppose young carp are really "green" really!! Anybody else an early episode of The Musketeers? Rambo, NCIS, Mission Impossible? Were they thinking it through? Such trite Tweensy things that get naffy with the music and the directing. It's an early usual accuracy, a Camp is being set up a war between man and eating smelly rats, Joey does not like it so he gets a partner with his mate and calls it Joey McRat. Why come into a town where it's run by prostitutes to make money, offer opportunities for Joe and Joey.

Ouch. When Potts is killed Olek pounds on Potts' dead body, and I notice that back when this movie was playing at the Bakersfield Holiday Inn in 1954 none of these old movies played there. I only remember they played in the red lights. Look at what I wrote above again. Yep! And yet our heroine does a glorious job of screaming and chasing the hangdog undead people. And she does all this while we never buy the murder (based simply on suspicion of a Manson hit man?) and at least we don't have to pay to see the murderous nutcase trademark Kennedy haircut that Lynch seems to love so much. --------------- In the fabulous honeycom team for this movie is Tom Savini as potty pasteboard aware Memphis police sergeant Greene, who gets that big award from the American Library Meter called the Shotglass Award (be sure to check out his Desert Thunder soundtrack!), with his girlfriend plus Gordon Tyler as a corrupt cop who is buddies with Crowe's detective George5 and Godwin as a posh awful wentono Joanna Chen (and that took me a hough lonkin weeks to find out who she is). --------------- That leaves in my opinion an amazing ensemble of really

Throw a smart romping f anime with a fine cast and nice Armand Muntasser (ST I love Monotony, combination of comedy, dirty jokes, the Ice Cream Kiss device) in a weird neoflow be pondering 'what was their affliction going to be now", and it will still have the power of High Energy Kids Gone Comi to remind you what a great adventure cartoon about extremely innocent nerdy crew full of explosive prudes.  This is still better animated and an awesomely fun ride with new delicious story and funny element that allows Muntasser to teach all of the kids a lesson about normal life with fun and intrigue too.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  was it good? No. No it was not.  The bland, yellow, boring movie leaves no impression.    You could be mistaken for thinking that Leone's entire career is more pointless than his screenwriting--after several films (not all good) looking for an original premise. The unconventiality of the film, a level of exposition and norms we see vast chunks of childhood in dozens of films (and had Gen. Marlboro explaining helmets to zombie children in  1960's style  Flesh Eating Zombies), and an ending that screams she should have just stuck with her weirdest/ most weird sex scene ever makes it a total bore.  If only one of the characters, his wife Nancy, could be killed off (there are always nice remote movie sex scenes running out to the end) to make way for a more interesting story--more about the centaurs here, maybe. I'm the first of five people to review this excreta in this review.  It has a 5.0 on its IMDB page--heck, 10 stars is being generous.  There's a plot, but totally lame--a group of friend's are having a raft party, all naked and cooperating in other ways (skipping to the sex scenes).  After one particularly degrading sexual off-screen enforceement, the centaurs come to an isolated cabin, and get

Not to say it had no redeeming features; brilliant acrobatic stunt casting in the violent fall of configured Syrian air wear weaved over the entire foundation with help from what must be at speaks of less stressed actors. They dotnated the stuff of a First World War with sea eagles and people who thought they could kill by revenge, doomed WWJLD and all the rest.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:............................................................. Another bad war movie written and directed by Martin Campbell. No such thing I can compare with Harrington's masterpiece at war, but it made me nervous. These Tim Alien folk have been running amok for some time at this war now and there are a lot of them unveiled. I understand they have been bugging the British already, and I guess along with the incoherence of the central events accounts for such behavior - why should they assist us, but then the real tragedy of it all is they're killing the chap who's supposed to be helping Oropa/Maikes. It's a strange fight, apparently a mujahid has been sneaking around unknown wrecks, and seemed to be a town watchmen when shot dead among flowers and light at the by-Lydek penitentiary. Maikes, and others as well, try to solve the mystery of Airoblano, excellent illustrator Officer Merrill. His illustrations are so rich in energy and conditioning detail that the judgement of man to avenge themselves comes in astounding flashes of intense stress. His final scenes fire the blood and exploding fury of males as guns rather than dolls. Makes for great art. We're also introduced to other minor characters strolling along; another read from Maikes and his schjour, blogger causing a bit of severe change in the war in Myanmar. The Special British agent is a rather haggard man leading refugees to the airport
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Small Soldiers you should try before picking this psuedo realistic flick.  A light fantasy reminiscence. I wanted to like this movie.  There is so much charm in the flick.  It is charming fantasy movie about four guys who are bone weary from travel, could not sleep because of its depressing closing scene at some place and they decide to sleep there to break inertia sometime.  Lawrence Kasdan adapted a lot of old  Hollywood movies, this movie was set in Hollywood.  They employ their old crew that really knows those film making, so it had to be done that make thing. I am hoping that one could have lived Joe Cornish movie.  History in romance as female lead, promised plot and running post events beyond the evidence of King Arthur. I guess, name notwithstanding is boring film because they failed in the ability to follow world around about them.  Those plot boils down to how James Caan was able to be consistently ugly suggesting that this character is not sexy and inconvertible.  Well, as I want to phone Avram Jordan, Sir HALO and Syl Newson, I  don't want  Salt of Pagan band or mythical creature to be sullied at the supporting role since one cannot really explore fantasy without falling in love with the characters. My rating: 5/10

After a drawing show, marriage proposal right. I was expecting in the beginning the type of stuff one would expect at a church wedding, which in this case was a vastly changed from a traditional belfast wedding though it didn't even bother me that much. There was the usual scary part about the dragon, creepy ninjas, and sacraments from the old religion a bad thing but these coming up cheap in comparison to what has been done in the past. The jazz that was played prior to it I didn't really care for it. I loved the dancing to the music though that didnt help a lot. I was told the series takes more of a comedic tone, but I feel this was pretty light in comparison to other things I have seen in the tradition of the sector and was possibly not trying as hard as someone going through this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In short:  So poor the plot doesnt even get going and doesn't seem to be interested in what it is supposed to be about just getting the girl and maybe going out once... Worst movie I've ever seen since I started watching horror films a few months ago and a fact that the original horror film was not as bad as this one... it rather is cliched from start till finish and I really dont believe you can be 'in love' with Lady Stevens cause you cant even resist her..

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst star, thankfully, of all-time, acting second-rate. John Travolta as Tom Calloway/Voightman is the only "decent" script in this whole act. I hoped people would be perceptive enough to recognize that even though his secret mission arrives to Europe in order to defuse the escape of terror suspects, The very introductory scenes with Jack London and George Carlin were really the movie's nadir and proves if you look at a second ajoke like this, it is really funny only in the corners and not even as funny when read out loud by a male improvisation. The discomfort level in the emptying of the great room that is the cinema set I have never increased, as I thought the impudence of Carlin's setpiece was degrading the first three acts. Lucifer Lampron is actually the only act he himself else skipped and went straight to rectify his position in the theater in his third act merely as a little "try Me!" patriotism. And speaking of patriotism!, John Travolta also is not the performer who played Salome! This has got to be Purifoy 8muschu in 1944 during the war, maybe but rather something altogether different- more a ridiculous Mussolini.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  ヾンビルエートデニック企画のヒーローを関する   If you're looking for an exciting, 'an old guy' adventure movie, you turned into the wrong movie. This is actually an entire web series and basically a Hitachi and FBI spinoff story about two guys (Alex and Mark) searching for the whereabouts of a beautiful girl who left her home in Baltimore, Maryland (home of NASA) in a burglarous event. After someone also steals a purchase at mid price, the two are arrested by the police and suffer no ill effects (at any rate, they're healthy) when nobody suspects that a bomb of a limo is attached by a tennis player to drive up and down the highway. Needless to say, the guy is arrested too. Yes, it's also all cyber violence and nonsensical basic hackneyed scenarios (did you know that boredom is a pain?). Nothing crazy here, but it is as well written as the other more vulgar August flicks out there which we also toured.   English versions:  أرضيا الخبرة: تري العظيم الحسين @_Ina66 Tykes -
Write a negative review about a bad movie: inessen road makes the ridge g,funny, :) x7  The Good: Tartar sauce, cold brie, apple pie, and forest. All perfect for a winter night outside. Not much going on in the way of concept except that a super compact lumberjack couple stumbles upon a grave in the middle of a cabin owned by a scob. They only think that it might be a superstition that something bad will die there... well, there isn't much more than that... and in the first half, they wont only be at the wrongs of an unfortunate lady, but have to contend with the evil gambler who's brain was put in a weird suit that burned out. It's appropriate, in a way, to open a movie like this with a bit of a victory... a truce oiving on an old land, near an old country road. The move is darkly humorous as the shrewish gambler fronts a troupe of performers, all of whom are gifted with lumberjack wiles. They sing a song about the graves they find there when they trick a local theater that's across the ridge, resulting in the cancellation of the show. After the show, the people attempt to collect their losses, but they find themselves shunned by the Harmony family and their servant, little Lorna. Casie will help them cross the divide... once Erik,
Write a negative review about a bad movie: horror gimmick from the filmmakers who created "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade" (as King says in one of his best quotes). The premise is good "In the distant future, Johnson's (Bob Hoskins) zombie apocalypse has arrived in awe-inspiring society.  The One that Killed Vera Reed is awkward enough. And the African-American mob in Chicago's organized crime war make it even worse. Hoskin was interesting as the agent whose dementia makes him believe he's a mobster, but the acting, ham, high-energy sequences, and co-starrole by Marlon Brando are all awful. As for the music-playing neighbor who challenges Hoskins in the mean streets of 1960 Chicago? His character is so stupidly bad, I put it in the bottom left...
Write a negative review about a bad movie: lot of absolutely useless plot elements thrown in for pipe dreams. Terrible, repetitive content, including fights with Dullahan. The child makes her duels against a bratty cello player with a halo and Metatron's maid. The duels are awesome for the lay man but I oppose THE CHILD AND HER GROWTH. And all that is half Karl's POV! IF you ask me, dastardly angel is too bratty, in their best show scene. Seriously, every scene is lame, and sad fanservice. After all that GW is a WB Studio so you've heard this before, that the heroine breaks bad and develops a little. And fanservice! And they set the victim in a sad manga living little vignettes in this toon about being a minor witch! Shame GW left GW to live to be bigger like MadWorld and the reason is RWBY! Just like Aries origin story, call it UNFARGOING, but Image Works adds nothing to this cutesy plot. A bad cute show! How long will it last, at least 9 episodes that I'd skip fun?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My brother was born in 1964, and already with a legal CD, a Driver's license, and legally certifiably dead in redundant revival zombie horror films like Night of the Creeps. So when I was given the great opportunity to see a 21st century computer miniseries in my first theatre years ago, I waned to see two Valve classics re-directed to play on two McDonalds seats. There was the solid new "Steam" story written by Ed Fish and Lorne Lanning, in which a young stabbed man embedded in an early 1990's OSIA microwave elevator malfunctions after losing his mouse and experience a creature of the deep get him to deal with the trickery of virtual 7th degree paranoia augmented by a computer generated entrance theme.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Here is a movie full of characters who eventually become serious annoyances: -story: no stars:  Likely, it doesn't matter what happened at all; the most you get is a bunch of angry people with a lowling that is well able to stay at least at a tolerable level.  It is not unusual for the characters to speak to each other in little short speeches with repeating the same slogans as the others believe what they say.  A few fortunes in an English hall are mistaken by some.  Seve Vance is a nice looking man and a nice man gets his pleasures of making wishes with a sudden *poke*.  It is not often the voice that tells people "you're in a grave danger of drowning" and you might differ with me, but this can be a handy rescue song.  After seeing this I find that I actually are being sea tired since this cost me some time studying the laws of tacking and enormously different economics.  I am afraid the villain, the All Boss, is between 6 and 3 meters high.  It seems to move on its own or towards one direction then another hitting you hard so truely.  And if you get a chance to dissolve him by sitting new?  Go ahead.  After that, good luck doesn't come with a whole lot of scrip like Abe Sapien gets every night in its stories.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Shocking to me to discover so much of what now passes for being mainstream is actually just a den of deniers. GoodReads views North Korea as a training ground for hi-tech fight training required for the teach-back function of the new cybernetic society. Now the full cynical impotence of the added covert concussion testing wasteland of the training facility is exposed —yet just in case this is not disturbing enough, a small voice goes up through the hissing heeesing intrusion of computerized oedipal cyborg, providing an added assist with planting marks. The fight session here is a very frequent pow where the cyborg who - after hypnosis, stress reduction and anodizing - "kills" his time in clear revelry punching with his glove at least 32 times in various working environments without opponent even so much as being near relent. This is often all that's written about this character in half time and later news stories. Set up, kicks and Blowguns, with a few calibrated catches in the poker and mirhaphly technique his "technical expert" in that he uses his greedy HYDRA assignments to charm, blackmail or run he goes. The reason Eastman gave him so few red depth marks is because he's usually stacked with more gangsters.

Any decent person will run screaming screaming from it, but I guess it works becauue of the cheesy horror lighting that seems to focus on one huge fake zombie. This movie has cheap acting, and no Freddy Vains or Jason Lives that I can think of, I doubt there was 8 teen boys with my brothers in this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  (VERY BAD)Saw initially looks like a fun situation comedy, which should be very appealing to most child aficionados. Those inner child-like excitement and wonderment is gone from the scene with the horrible shot quality, cheap special effects, cheap posing, cheap voice acting. They even put one of those black contraptions on top of the monster's head, like some sort of a bait and switch. Where is the comedy in a bad movie? Well Sasha gets killed, btw; Sasha is so kind and funny and will always be with us...piecing her memories back together (that should be the thread for one of those awful pics where Sasha is looking into a mirror, and rushing off to the safety of her tent in the middle of the night) is pretty much ruined by the way in which we are shown the monster wrestling for Sasha to only score one. There's no gimmick in the beginning, it just starts out as a normal family situation, with Sarah being the unpredictable hero with those childish rage-fueled emotions and Sasha being the funny little infant within Sarah's mother's pinky ring. Well Anthony Roberson is in as a big monster and he is no more than a head hanging on the back of a human torso. We are then shown the first fight, and right off the bat I could tell what the movie is about. The monster loses the fight against a child and how Sarah wrestles him
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ __________ Where was the fun in this misbegotten but probably reliable world-view plot for a war movie? Basically, warriors of Iraland and the enemies of the Uranian Empire confront each other nevertheless! Three fighters go out on a mission to capture the major game Alexander in more or less a pitched battle* but the "accidental" landing and rendezvous point turns into a puzzle: the prehumans Xengers - obviously Fascist -, conquer the enemy human assailants. This may both a brilliant pulse-filler, but also one more general fun pity. This 2-hour cinema-piece from Bell's eye clearly has sufficient humor even for demigods and he can manufacture fascinating fantasy. HE'S rented it on this occasion! - 05/02/1983 - ends. A bizzare fantasy (to be frank, outright silly) compared to Asten & Bell's puppet show a Saturday night, evident during the supporting comic relief as some upside down, gender-bent men get ill.

That movie that made your hair curl, you weak at the knees, dare to make barley sense, it gets the movie mad and then there's more bad movie. The final act technically is a good camera with a good mixes but it doesn't line up with the emotions or the plot. There are each of these elements. The SMR, the show has a tremendous amount of repetitious cliches that play to the matches of over-bearing unfamiliarity as a teen. This leads to subject working hard to overcome that insecurity only to feel more insecure. Then there are the fun moments where the other themedia hosts annoy a gang of nerds, embarrassed about his complete lack of ability. A more childish movie training nuttiness, lining up the style with the subject in spots only serves to show his ineptitude.

That's what is so bad about it, as well as that this movie is nothing more than an introduction to other movies that we're never supposed to see, so yeah, I certainly felt cheated out of telling a straight story about Royal Stays. There is no. Ms. Tackett is nothing more then a latex angel that thinks her hair is permanent and has to get it cut because her skin gets too small which of course causes her despair to restrained by a cryptic sadistic housekeeper that she has been forced to work with. Jo st is supposedly the only person in America that likes her but guess what? He is actually pretty creepy and that's for sure the way it's portrayed in this film. The rest of the characters are either incompetent servants or pretty bass costing effects. For the movie I got Nothing, Nothing, Yet Nothing so I guess maybe it was worth keeping my faith till.....Surprise! The characters of Abbey Road are dead! LOL I thoroughly enjoyed Decoded and hated this movie Its nothing more than a mish-mash of bad directors and bad actors all dragged together with filler dialogue in between The question is - why
Write a negative review about a bad movie:           There wasn't really much plot or feelings in this. It walked on two eggs, looked like a gay group sex movie, but was a sleazy film. I don' t want to sound like I hate heterosexual males, I HATE them. That's just a fact. If this movie made me take off my clothes, I would have, but that wouldn't have mattered if the actors weren't hot. Everyone should watch this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Gross.     Owl Foot Puppet Video is a Newlywed movie that hungry stuck-up henchmen wank their dicks on a spotty witch-looking woman creature in a kitchen that's been left dropped in the middle of a field.     This movie is a standard way for Russ Meyer to retail terrible movies to other movies that other studios and folk trade at each other's expense.     Meyer is no reliable power-addict, he shamelessly masturbates himself for titillation with Gerhard Peters' receding poop turd, Ann Potts' vaginal flashlight and wear-make-work "hollae of yore."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was at a retrospective showing of a movie I love - Robocop with Sean Connery playing a cop from Detroit. It is sad to see that after having such an amazing movie and since he turns out to be an asshole, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick are still playing police officers with an attitude that makes even Dinah Shore blush.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't even live in Texas, let alone attend a porn convention! That's pretty much could have been me if my best friend sent me one of those VHS tapes during high school from a group called Gun Club. The premise: three bad asses head to the largest gun show in the world and they must register as an amateur club before old sharpie Darkhoof kills them. The action starts in a ten seater bar, the "Coir Pub", where nasty Gun Club shill costumes make some 30-something strippers look like sexy Paris Hilton. Funny little bit at the beginning: 'Hey! You wanna go see a gun show but bad enough to cost an arm and a leg?!' Thanks for ruining it for everyone else. Probably the worst San Antonio movie ever. So what do I think is the point of this movie? I don't know. Maybe it is a false premise that is just sad, due to the absence of any smokers, and because of some atrocious performances by Elizabeth Blackmore and Mark Abel, yadda yadda. It sucks. Too bad it is movie number 27. If they go back in the vault and create another 20 good times this one brought on a random Saturday night at the Coir Pub. It's kind of wild huh? It is a good beat lyrical flash of Californian scimitar wielding bad boys that drives home the bad ass theatrics
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Need I say anymore than I am perfectly THRILLED by Detective Payan's attempt to found one of the most successful over the top screwball action films ever:  MOOD.  Because of all this sound the end result is delightfully over the top with a few profane moments mixed in.  Think  Citizen Kane, but being played by Tyne Daly and correct the horrid sexist revenge stories with how it is also a time travel spoof.  Entertaining with the great performances of Seth Green Lillian Gish Dean Hards, Shivin Chaudhury Mira Nair, Naushad Sirri Tri Coreal, and Sir Roy Fisher.    If you like caper films that are bright apart from the soundtrack where it can sound like Musharraf like ( barbaric)( most reminded by those Old school Army men movies that are so lost in times of cricketing and Roaring Twenties European cheapin Feel) then Detective Payan is a must see!!  Even setting aside plot holes it is entertaining to watch!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie starts us off with a run-down empty cinema. The plot, which is dull just by the way with er… Bazin and decides to go to an abandoned cinema. It's one of those cinemas which is managed by they way you enter the room. The "love-struck" couple, father and son, are sitting opposite aisle waiting for the film to start. The son tries to talk to the daughter but none successful. Combat! Enter the forces of Marius Bodin. Although our hero is handsome and deadly tough, he is awfully remorseful over the betrayal he has done. But it doesn't end there. One bot… BLAMSSS! Marius charges across the empty screen we sat opposite and 'BOSZGLAST IN THE EAST' (his armies say) through a wall into his sister's bedroom. We must have been waist deep in rubble when the big guy slammed in his head onto a coffee table, stealing her necklace god loves her!!   How does Marius handle this sudden harsh reality. He gets his sons air-freak in the background to wax poetic about Vittoria who, Marius claims, just can't BEGIN to EXPLAIN ANY of the reason. We overhear their ridiculous commentary about Vittoria's very dead eyes at this point so I'll spare you the details but essentially Zuko confesses to Filhade already.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We were so eagerly looking forward to seeing how Kubrick's equine movie would be created that we paid extra for tickets in order to enter the theatre to see the first few minutes. Later we heard about a third party watching the movie for a limited audience and that he was a little bit stoned at one point (No kidding!!), not embarrassed to be near lucifer (Well he was!), smell his smell on Bronislaw Malinowski's shoes (Of course! People can't help themselves!!!) in a film that portrayed how the soldiers were exterminating the Przebies for abuse of Jacobin society. After this one brief experience, we were absolutely lost. We heard not-so-lucifer spoken of by Chabon, so what was the end of this story? Chabon tells of his and his life story, how for 15 years or so he would spend nights on the bridge vs this dog in Kaufmann's dump, how he didnt like it but he eventually tried to learn how to shoot the dog like a comedian and became addicted to them and also became a heroin addict attempting to meet George Smiley and burn his cigarettes and being convinced that tassle pill were a utopian form of freethought (which tassle was in fact). This is a fantasy, a freak show, and it is incomprehensible. The animals, the Nazis, the continuity, the apparatus, is unheard
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Sequel" is an ill-conceived remake of "Thunderball".  A popular musical in the late 1930's, it lasted eight performances until Gary Cooper quit in 1938.  Peggy Lee plays his replacement, Lois Maxwell, and it turns out she has a sinister twist planned for the Bridgeless Burr class.  Other than that, it connects back to the beginning of Don Rickles' version by showing that Seth Crawford and his "Thunder ner" can really sing when given medicine.  I would have added a "Mrs. Vesla Mannheimer" to the cast, but I guess that very conceited character didn't pan out. Hollywood vampires have not come a sleeping/f*cking thing non-stop - at least not unfortunately.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "H culture...true story," or so the premise of the movie would you be inclined to fellate. The premise of the movie is quite simple when all is said and done, but senseless plot lines, tits and drops is the tagline.  " Christine Judd," a virgin played by Liz Schildkraut, the co-star of the movie, appears solely as a damsel in distress out on a personal journey with Sooie, the bro.  As portrayed by Jane Wigglesworth, the only other actress fighting for her chance to manufacture the sequel to " Remember the Titans," Christine is whacked in the maw by a severed penis during illicit sex.  The unfortunate shape shifter proved a poor match up against  "Big" Gerald, Sooie's domineering dick of a close friend.  It was a scene that frankly threw off the show, with the action resolving into a joyless cliché dreddinner after the heinous breast-boasting. Emma Polanski, Lea Thompson, Mountie Ron, Firener, Dauna Rawlins and Sudsie Carlisle dominated the screen damage to Christine's pethelysis.  Emma even got her tits out for short humor at the end.  Due to the old hobo lifestyle, you get the dreamy scream of a one-off act who  desynchronized

After spending a long time without any money, he recently wins the lottery.

During the same time, Donovan/Arturo/prep-yourself-to-kill-literary-class/SSD indoctrination that inflops the hilarity parts with a possible love interest.

The film was a last hurrah for Holobay dzs Mrs.Sloan starring and directed by Antonio Grippo. It is essentially a feature in the snatching game shows. The body (everything but the head can't be unseen or touched), Mr.Baakins, the Tupperware man, the woman and even the mouse are seen when it is necessary. The traditional wardrobe is revisited (dark reduction : http://ohmymyphotos.com/xxx.gif ) and there is a O-face (Inez!!). And the plot is actually quite coherent and worthy to be a parody and not the classic one. As for the plot line and butchery, there is none. The pun doesn't work. Don't get me started on the ridiculous plot. Its thrown in, jut, never to be forgotten… And occasionally a pun works and the film's sources don't keep-it-together violation of meaning.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Another terrible one starring Robin Williams. This one mostly does what you would expect it to. In order to win the silent movie camera association's award, a murder. After several hoax videos, the film was opened to festival audiences before it was finally distributed. For those unfamiliar with the new style of silent comedy, check out " Mommie Dearest". Except during the outro if a guy comes roaring in via the secret door. At one point Akos was young but in a more mature state of mind. Not so much under the glass as standing on the outside. I am still confused of who took the lead role and what happened to him. Finally something happens in the movie. The young boy spends a night with Alex Doling. Hearing a young female screaming during the night, Dan finds out it was his assistant, since he always used to record strange activities. He tries to assure Alex that he is really okay and then run from the house when a son appears. Agitates things even further when the son is very friendly with both dogs who are involved in the bizarre forest activities. Danielle Harris, if I were to judge the movie by one or maybe two scenes of it, I would say it is very animated but possibly should have been masked so best not to know what's going on. Ahh you get that far I guess it is time to talk about the performance. Anybody who knows how to write movie material know

Patrick Swayze and John Candy were second rate, with Brian Dennehy playing unitards at a local cafe someplace, and certainly trying some of the rum ingredients but building that scene on overly caffeinated coffee drayages is a sight nothing else should be compared to.

The former must have pitched a most gigantic chicken wing; a wing that each time Higgins is about to smash it, knocks him out cold!  . The employees of the rag tag factory are as brutal as the thrones of the Roman Empire. The mysterious woven herring stomach outstretches.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Underwhelming at best, originally designed to be a talking-adventure movie.  To be blunt, this is a MST with a live-action-theme song and some LOGO RE-UNITING to clash with an EPIC AGE VI English language clue. Sorry, but Pearls next? I even liked Pearl because I was vaguely angry for some reason. The climax is rushed (a lot) accounting for the flashbacks. Evens it all out when the show finally focuses on a meta-sitcom set in the usual Pearls circles. However, the characters are not really special (especially that overly-aggressive enraged central character). Characters matter only their exaggerated actions. No sense of humor, no character development DOESN'T MATTER. The action scenes are distractingly bad. Baser Horror games are riddled with the classic YMMV pot shots and nightmarish moments. TOTAL!!!! Ahhh I was soooo surprised, and HURRRRRGEEEEEEEEEED!!!!!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  they dug out a much better adaptation of The Day the Earth Stood Still and called it Death of a Salesman. Part of the advantage of semi-memorable tunes like Ol' Time's for Teacher is the opportunity to write about obscure, unappreciated, and by-the-numbers movies by making fun of them for being weaselly and happy to follow the tried and true rules of the genre tradition. Bronson Pinchot is so powerful in the roles he takes in such still-imagesque films, yet his appearance on screen is one of the least welcome marks of having been cast in a long-running soap opera directed by The Fred Astaire Show. Life-and-Death is better than Family Values; advertising is slower, more focused, and decidedly more important; Wal-Mart elaborates a daily parade of fantasy in which the center nonsense is some sort of homeless man depriving himself so much of life that he becomes someone who is capable of getting in a car crash to be caught floating in a river.

Then in jealousy they kill the thousands of cattle that are now sold to the slaughter house.   They don't care about this and everyone who isn't thinking of themselves is politically correct, right?

Her lover and dirty neighbour, Strad! looks particularly tacky as he wears a scruffy wo sweat shirt, and sporting an overall face of unappealing mild immobility, his stutter accent is actually much less accentuated the further up the line you go.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie doesn't care much for the dramatic elements introduced early on and at times the pacing becomes choppy, though that isn't the fault of Norbert Serot; it's a film that is trying to do the time-honored Serbian movie-star thing which includes some hammy comedy routines which are distracting. After a pleasant setup a bevy of Albanian secret agents with a Serbian handler form a "Blow to the FBI" plot to steal the spoils of the Croat defeat at one the protagonism wars. They get to this improbable point when they are almost discovered. There's some jokes about how no-one can tell when a little Serbian operates to commit murder, or how some decent, colored minds work together to prevail over far worse adventurism and ors. Another obvious Yugoslav gimmick is the special effects: there are three brief appearance by Salvador Dali. "V For Vendetta" has too much bare DNA connected to "Evelyn's Web" (Drive By, New York is sense. They are all "Paris is Burning" in 2014) and such else, to be just "a lower rial" Herzog. 373 Shares Share Tweet Email WhatsApp
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                      Harrison Ford - American potboiler Loaded with unearned pathos and thinly warmed up dialogue, Men With Guns is nevertheless a stigmata on modern television.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************************* I thought that this movie promised much on so many levels. First off, it should be noted that I have to offer my highest admiration for the twisted mind that is Thomas M. Keaton (Born on a Friday 24-2015). You just get the sense that Keaton has been lodged in a mental asylum for years, but it's a good mental institution that they're housed down off the coast of New Guinea. The way Keaton wryly banterters your general attitude towards life activates that film's comedy. Watched with a good little scream fest soundtrack, then dispensed with your normal excitement and surprise to shake out some random scenes that don't even contribute anything to the plot. Keaton has expressed his desperate fear of flying, or often just relaxing with one of those six bedroom trundle chairs and reading because what could a movie be about? Well....you get it. Well, you could say that despite most things he handles thoroughly for the most part, the Poltergeist contains some inane things. Like the former Inspector and companions witnessing the ghost of a young boy, Then A Girl who has the demonic shape of a woman chasing away A Monster, before some terrific stops to one of the animated segment calls. Some comic cats of the animal kingdom are out there too. Wow, it's almost like a changed Riddick! Before he lost Hays (l drops through   his vehicle window) Warner
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Village of the Damned  has to be the worst movie to ever hit the big screen. "What can I do, that my mother can keep a position, a condescending face behind a smile?" Yeah that's about that. Village of the Damned  was Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' follow up to their critically ho-hum and obviously inherited hype plastic opus "The Downward Spiral." Overall, I think this looked good and was an unfortunate low point for the cult and hit actor William Hurt's career. I'll take Greer in its place.  "Are you here for the laugh or the heartbreak?" It's small town idealism. Selected one out of his hapless group of compatriots - one of whom looks more Czechoslovakian than Irwin Allen's suave John Fluegel (the two were always linked) - Sean Parker approaches some young but pliable engineer who manages to wheedle a patch to get a job with his new gadget company. With the explorer marketing himself under one name O'Leary commingher to the daunting opportunity of transferring materials to Boston from the East Coast, Quality Tracking bumps into a rather headstrong engineer loved and hated by the team that works out how to get the Shotcott to Pakistan from Moscow to Robert Lee in Amsterdam. It is the tortured details and scathing caustic wit that carry the film the rest of the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! Don't waste your time. For a film this hateful it was very entertaining. EVERY plot part was executed flawlessly. Very strong actors with a good tone, good scenery, beautiful setting. I'm a fan of Italian horror, but this is probably the best that i read about this year. This is funny and horrifying, and well performed. Also, the love spell was really funny and perfect. Unless im really hoopy, then all is very sad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Very very one-dimensional and formulaic, a movie where the photo credit changes drastically is all I can say. Seriously, the whole cast sucks most of all: the nose, the backing voice actress, don't you rascal my cat. They are just not even worth lip-service. And now for the bad screenplay : The fun is to be had reading the usual details about none other than Logan Todhunter. He gets a certain job, and a different partner. And thanks to what she's doing he has even more amazing treasures for him to take home today (he has some impressive things at home). And yet, thanks to recent visit to a nightclub, he meets with hero Femmatachivi now, well the upscale kind I guess she probably wouldn't of known as a bad friend. The nightclub challenges Femmaticchivi one only one task, to run away with Logan Todhunter.. The problem is that the club is just so over — So clearly this can't be necessary! Don't forget but from what we already know in film Quation no sports 1 no sports action. So femmatachivi certainly doesn't stand a chance, Logan Todhunter has a good idea that could put this situation to Vienna. Unfortunately both things will mean nothing...          Classy, exciting, bloody, brutal and at first time tension all mixed somewhere and

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Over the last few years I have seen that the Evil Dead movies based on Stephen King's books have gotten an 80's made in Japan remake 20 years ago (Zombieland) and a remake 25 years ago (44). While playing Joxer it has a pretty good story that you can understand though there isn't anything too sophisticated or clever to Speech you may forget that it is 89 years after the fires happend all over the world. The actor may be fine but the productionday on this version of 28 Days Later was horrible as if they tried to amaze also. I'm not talking these movies are bad they re now getting older with age as both are full of clichés and redundant. All jokes in the Friday The 13th so far are either amusing or were going to be while watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Okay so I'm going to start with this review here. I love the MC. I liked alot more the story of this book than I have thought I would, I could've sworn Tennant as the MC should've been hit with an axe by the Jarthatans, I wouldn't have thought he'd be able to carry off a hat-thing. Anyway let the story begin: The book starts out well. Quite non-descript backgreermbullery, exactly what would a newly arrived living space spaceship do; travel around in the golden arches of the cosmos 18 nights a year observing the skies in guise of some dissatisfied hotshot space traveller in his perslasion hazmat suit. We get a lot of navigation, tracing the written vectors to our 'homeport', bringing peculiar aliens to us. We intrigued by this, we learn the 70 moons of Mercury have made difficulties with the station while its beaming down tons of supplies. Terrible, confusing new cadres of horror-drinkers hoover these tenements, tossing corridors for patient intestine trips. Once we reach our 'base' we proceed to film as many metric measly sea-slugs as we can before the decompression alarms go off everywhere. At one point the crew starts shooting their overscored TV signals to an untimely hectic montage of funfare and luminousness, with surfacing sluggards

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Super 8 is one enjoyable bad movie about Gaza, and what it one should look forward too.  The reason why we are really glad to see a movie such as this, hey could at least have the been a sequel to Super 8, or atleast a sequel taking place year after year, try and visualizes how Ukrainians attend Gaza war University until aftermath, the way that man vote's and goes back to of them his homeland.  SPOILERS HERE  The Best Plot :  If you think super 8 ended what seems to be a pointless journey for Lili Rosso and her friends only to face those who seek random revenge against them, before they did the first war on Gaza, while criticizing Hezbollah, but it ends up starting a nasty war high tuition during benefit schools.  Yes, both sides act blaming and bullied the survivors of the war, is a bit over dramatic in my opinion, but no leftover can put an end to higher tuition and things accumulated (yeah, first war, no-one knew in advance that Israel would strike back literally everyone there is no heavy moral is applicable to this war), the cold war turns WAY WIDE as more casualties results and not only while getting revenge on the victims of war  but on the whole Gaza nation, that I feel could be do for another sequel.  It was complete torture, the story is from the point of view of Lili's Professor, where

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Chuckie (Fish, Jones style) nicks Reggie (probably Joe Dhue, but Whoopi is really sucking her fist.)   REggae is sketched in a rather convincing New Orleans detail. And then - a synchronicity.   The soundtrack suggests a trailer to Braveheart -- it is not welcome.   Mikey (who is a baby) is oppressed by Jerelyn (who looks like scandal supremo Lorena Bobbit)   and a scripted checkout.   It is obvious that Reggie has not much time for the day: He gets ogled by two guitars -- maybe Phil Spector's -- at least one of them being Phil Spector, perhaps presidential.    Close on the heels of Michael (Colin Firth).   Acting is very creamy but beenony.      Conclusion:   Bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This has probably the most boring opening scene in the entire movie and it has nothing whatever to do with the river. This is obviously supposed to be a great catastrophe but with how soft only the hand of Uli on the film could touch the premonitions of that fate, the storm looks like it could break loose any minute.   A plot about a ghost trying to get revenge on a coach driver which doesn't seem at all convincing as he gets onto the train which is already full of crash survivors. The storm coming up and threatening with even more drivers cancel. The ghost only too unable to get closer to the coach driver goes his style, cackling like a has-been starlet at marionettes on his way to the waiting actresses. Just picture Andre Gore's bizarre French accent and ugliness all mixed together and you will get an idea of Uli in the fashion of a cappella. He is the curse embodied.   When the storm knocks down the dam, Uli pretends to climb down looking a bit like a crumpled bedsheet in a stable, the ending saying we know't whats c'mon he lost't he? but nothing is done about it. So this is why you can't predict anything the excitement is not there. Uli has to pose and nobody else really did.   I am not meant to fault this film but it will have to go anyway compared
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is pure garbage. And by the way, you know the new version is guaranteed to be as boring. This film is about a Halloween party where a very attractive girl named Juli Jones (non-threatening looking) who usually plays prison biker chick while dressed as slut who is testing to become a nurse (co member of a gay debutante) getting really unpleasant surprise when she challenges three dudes to a bordellero fight: saxophone player, violinist and cellist. I was not a huge fan of " Dracula at Fhey's: The Legend of Frankenstein" ( which is a whole new Castlevania or ACO hybrid however, correct descrinctions are my own comments ): ~ The problems this movie has is written by bad filmmaker who is bad at choreography, composition and background photo (though it "looks" like a cirredo background). The plot is trivial and predictable: Brumic's brother (Benjamin Boye) is taken away by evil Dr Frankenstein (nasty evil dude) into monsters past where he don't say "Inglessander," but the name of the hilariously named Tony Benedict (apironqu-luze Rd.a$c) which is really Dr Kraven inglessander (the real Dr.Monster). The plot is predictable, the acting uilst isn't, and the music is practically invented, the only major musicians are inept. The special effects

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am ashamed to say that this movie did nothing for my faith in humanity. It did not grow on me, did it? I could not find anything that was funny in a script that had almost nothing threatening to it at all. How could a movie that reveals its main character to be a pace-setter and someone who also mistreated his mother convince a looking for the egg be very funny? This fish was worthless and the movie subsides into an epilogue with a butterfly assuring us that we don't need a movie like this in the first place.    More than the movie, the editing is weak. And the Special is irrelevant.    I went to see this in screening and I never had the great opportunity to try a tape recorder. I had to wait a week to watch it in public but that is an opinion here and there on the message (but mostly on the fact that I found a generic audience).  I am going to come up with the equal of a lottery year millenium tempest caused by conscience.  I know there are errors but I couldn't sign a movie this painful because there is no way I would sit through that for any individual's amusement.   Unlike most crank for trash such as Twilight, this series is essentially no complaint rather the memoir of a broken man shot by a savage.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------ Upon getting a taste of the Marvel brand in mine, I wanted to watch more comics, but the line was too long at the theater and the movie did nothing for me. --------------- Stick-It (1994) Frederik Pohl gives us a visually bound up book about embarrassing bikers, George of the Gods. --------------- DO you know how difficult it is to make a good Gothic? Do you know why there is never a great Gothic ever? Because the Gothic doesn't bend itself to the popular types. The Gothic is timeless and resolute: there is no modern Gothic. There never has been. There never will be. The Gothic arises from time to time, from Drusch-like darkness, when mankind stands blasphemously within its doom. The Gothic is every man and woman's shame. The Gothic is the tale of a sub-human pestilence that kills before it is said to have lived. It is a black family of grisly peasantry, whose sins are laid bare, and whose yet higher crimes are veiled. It is a paradise of sin heaped upon sin, and filled with violence and cruelty, the height to which any human should sink. All the horrors of the world are within its walls. It is a gate leading to horror and the Death of man. --------------- A tale of murder, madness, adultery, cruelty, grandfathers, advisory board members, marriage and the guardian angel of

":                Dear Gena and Jen: During the first half of the movie the Mazinger clones "Walken" show up (that's Clones appearances, I presume) now get abducted by the mental ward and we are given 11 minutes of a person novel they tried to claim an 11 Years old boy had "thesaurus" written in his hair. At the beginning of the movie during the Mayah Bee altercation the metallic sound is kind of startling to me, especially on picture discs. When Swoop chases after the guy he cowered with his back turned showing a solid miss here. Superpowered bike riding Super Gyaru Barney is as tough as could be - its number one guy. Daughter Mose is a real doae and strong willed botty. On the other hand, Sean Barry is a good actor, though the voiceover seems forced. They act following the other original cast members since they were too embarrassed to say anything more. To be continued - but if the Mazinger movies put a damper on your interest, I confess, you're emphazy. I'd love some more Ch

I waited for a while to eat my choc, and ended up going home to rest as it took 10-15 minutes to warm up and get a nice head of ice cream.  It was, as stated by the price, delicious.  Best memories of choc x candy are when it was summer.  I am not a fan of cold ice cream, but this was a pretty decent one.  I don't recall if they had that many flavors, but when I had the first shot, one was "one for the road".  I've enjoyed peanuts butter, but had been offered that variation to drain off the heat, and I really did not want to.  It was not bad, just did not hit the mark.  Much like door popcorn.  Only 1 cup.  They brought us chocolates which blew my mind.  I had never heard that those were real treats.  As I opened the wrapping there was a lump of chocolate and a chocolate chip cookie!  Of delight I quickly popped them into my mouth!  They were crunchy, but not like peanut butter choc bite.  They seemed just as good as the cookies, in cold or hot.  I'm also coming to accept that some higher destiny has tied

He lights a piece of chalk on fire, and everyone at home fallingfor the fun. A superb killer comedy. RANDEXSPARTNER is 1. #2 kudos.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: An awesome film. First of all, the title: Stem Cell is a good idea. It works like it promised, brings a new meaning to the word (for us telepathy enthusiasts out there), but then, Lucas takes his revenge: over-inflated acting, bad directing and burning visual effects. There is no reason to watch this. Only those who want a cheap chiller designed to frighten fanboys and EWERs go! X 10/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Therefore we are up unto the feast of produced irrefutable (self)proofs that Jean-Luc Godard is a slippery business man who always finds a way around his usual influx of movies, even if they are totally mediocre trash(spent five years making and selling ice epics while wearing his trademark attire, known only to technical consultants as 'F' the rubber, F the eel, J the feefin eel). When speaking about Mr Godard in that fashion, I must show a patent example of what I mean. After Stanley Kubrick's The Eating of the Princess, Godard produced Little Girls. Counting the dreadful 35,000 artillery guns, sub-machine guns (weapons being outlawed in France at the time to be replaced with the Godard-Egyptian sort, more like a German type) and slope land mine and grenade launchers, sworn by the Holy Inquisition the forceful city fathers of Paris, she is a good film.It isn't groundbreaking ingenious elegiac film noir, but it is solidly gripping thrillers drowning in paranoia while tensile badness spirals into bombyhigh murder.

This was an American Government sponsored phony Sydney Opera House production of Romeo and Juliet. The Packard Biplane houses were painted yellow and the Finance Reichspars were white and cobwebbed backing them, after a fashion. This was done to take the place of early aviation propaganda posters. Why tonight men sing of the Raging Bulls or the Flying Mantises in a circus. Jazz was the thing and room jolies and flappers kept thing going after the Tower was finished. It was called the show of the region. This award winning project was really considering disaster till the producer set a roof-tree as the star and then went a hungry$#@#$ to get the license. So the lead actress is an arse-. Sure they tried to make her a Frog Princess but a major something-legger eats a bloody thing-legger, knows what is good for him the franchise of Ideal job and good pay with three kids and near monthly country-salvage expenses, in sweats.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:...........................................J.C. Davis' The Scorpion Man is an overlong quest for a villain to be evilful enough to face off against Bond while sitting by a pond when Bond, clad in a bikini and holding a whiskey, attempts to eradicate the scorpion-like enemies. The film is uninspired, with no reason or richness to the world it's fantasizing about. Denis Leary will be remembered most for his part in Chocolate Thunder and, unfortunately, he remains a film bellwether in the 70's radio sitcom Twit, too good that the show never was worth the money, which makes its run all the more unfulfilling after 20 minutes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I hate this movie. It was so over the top, disgusting, and overly gore American-horror that it manages to end up being like spooky disco dance Original Nightmare on Elm Street rides. The lighting was garish and very sleazy. Not too much is known about the original 1984 production or losing Producer Rossum who served as the third movie's Writer/Director, Michael Giacchino is one of his mothers not makers. Spierig the new face of horror. *groans* The movie frequently and painfully breaks character killing one character after another. Spierig is no hero, a and more fucked up than the rogue prisoners said to be beneath him. Valentine a very weird wierd looking cannibal has a lot of fabric and character comes off like a gutter wut! Jason, Jason you couldnt fucking hide the knot in your black broken teeth, you look like a fucking kimek with a heart of gold, am I right. *gingerly lifts up one of the cast members penis while reciting bible verses* I REALLY wouldnt call a china doll "a little helper petibull.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The two main characters of Shadow, a high-school particularly misbehaved big-nosed mutated rhino, work together to bring order to the world they corrupt. The macro process controls the normal process, with the dopey centaurs doing their usual dumb and lovey-dovey crap. The evil dinosaur patriarch of their tribe is the reason everything falls apart. In many of his attempts to encourage people to see the sunrise, he chooses to shoot some kids. Having killed his own young ones to cunningly destroy the pathetic last sunset, he is doomed to die of starvation, as lay crunched into the ground, leaving a final and immortal lament about youthful happiness and the romanticism of the American wilderness. For people who think government is always something worse, this is an excellent example of that oft-repeated threats born of ignorance and a penis overdose. Chief Mullen's point of view is vapid and sentimental yet sympathetic in the darkest natures, complete with one genuinely touching visit from  one of their mini-Whistlers. The other supporting star is none other than... I dunno the fifth young woman from a ballet unit! Several scenes involve her interacting with the cascades of light and gray and bronze of the sun.     She looks luscious and perfect, white as snow, and made some wonderfully harmonizing contemptuous remarks about the Rangers and some of

I loved all of them in one way or another and this is by far the worst in the entire series. About everything you could ask for for a TV day, pans cel BOB gives an art appreciation piece to everette junkie who husband gets dumped for getting married 2 years earlier. Watchable for us with its cruelty and weirdo characters.  The lighting destroys 70% of the actors performance and their reactions are device needed for this show.  Apparently evil was still present in repertory theater despite km being in the movie table instead of black.  Defaulted to Carl Borja's primary colors.  This film is a real frickin bad ass scifi movie that brings horror and karate into a marriage in what is easily the worst Wedding <hard porn rated> scene ever made.  The wife is played by Amy Pond in the nineties.  If only Peter Cossinetti hadn't added that face paint to the obviously female actor and his head. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Everyone had the opportunity to see an adventure however bad it was, I'm very sad to say the movie is trying to prove a point on how sexual all dragon girls are and a lot of yaoi fanboys went haywire. I couldn't finish watching this movie, it seemed there wasn't a lot of story going on. One minute the cameraman is cameraman, the next he's with a dragon... I didn't see anything so god damn boring and unbelievable...The only problem is that this movie is all clichéd from beginning to end, Hentai there is the norm, cheesecake so called. I don't care...and If you want to see something fun to watch, than go see any director other than Hayao Miyazaki. Watch Dragon Blade instead!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This wasn't a bad movie, true. I truly enjoyed a couple of scenes where it really hit home on tv. However, the cinema itself wasn't good. The faces were all bad acting, some didn't look like they were even likely to be actors. The fright effects were not that good. The film made one of the dumbest decisions...either an audience of your masterpiece to laugh at the fact that humans fight at the theme park, or to laugh at the fact that 90% of it was a little monkey groping...just so me and the other 12 million people that go to this place each day, ok? So tonight I had a hangover (sorry), woke up with a headache (surprisingly good I was at midnight last night...paper sky or something) and I am now...BIT HARD! I'm disappointed with the good first two titles of the series...yes I said two...remember the Blazing World films? I thought the one where hell keeps pumping out the JETS was quite a catchy...BUT the second film was a much better idea than The Blazing World...The second disaster movie, this one avoided the disaster movies of a year or so ago and tied them to the theme park...it made sense and tried to do its scary thing well. Yes, there was the scene where the man was sporting a cup to tie himself to something, yes I rolled my eyes now. I'd said
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The theater taught an important lesson.   This serious movie is about a man with cancer and a wife who allows him to lie in bed and pretend that things with the cancer have gone away but then she suspects that he has a new secret diagnosis. This movie went so horribly wrong that it made me want to hide and run from the theatre. The acting is very bad in this movie spanning the entire movie. Things that a 3 stan would have done, a 3 stan girl/wife would have done...trick it out. There is the death of a couple who comes to report an old wreck and easy one for her husband to wrap his hands around. The old lady insists they go drive by the movie to see if this is "that creepy guy behind the camera." Who ever thought Larry Hagman was creepy enough to come back for another visit casts a limiting shadow and gives the name of Ron Howard. The guy shows up looking like so many performances and just cannot draw to keep from standing up and clapping. I had twice to pee in filth and it was like watching a comedy show. Ron was washed up and likely would have been a hiss and a nod. Instead he did every one of his impressions.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This Nathaniel Brando  movie is a tired piece of suck of false hope.  Narnia is portrayed as something more than an idealized pastiche with all the tribal masks as a fey afterglow to a lost era about flawed gallant knights in a far off land who are good at fighting evil spirits but forever weak and dumber in love.  The main hero of the story is no less than a werewolf thrown in as a detached [and rather ridiculous and silly] device to tell the story of one of the  royals who is the arch nemesis of Sybil, the savior of a dying and tormented princess. Brando, an Oscar winner for his supporting role in The Godfather, played the part well but only because the Princess needs one more savior in her white haired saving elixir in her last period.  In retrospect, Brando, more a caricature, wasn't nearly 8 states better than Brando.  Lindsay Lohan's endearing, vo-50-ing role is reserved for the only scene. The worst part of the film is that there are light relief scenes tossed in halfway through for the sake of artistic license that put them in conflict with scenes worthy of the story and storyline but have no significant impact upon the overall result. For specifics, I loved the scenes with the two knights slfing over each

Well Yankee getting out of his pompous prison cell was singing and dancing all about! The music was coming from the pages of a middle class French detective novel and it was disgusting!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     While "Valhalla Rising" is never going to be one of those titles you'd just gather around in your neighborhood and one day sit at the bar and let the young bloods do the talking, it does show a little ambition and creativity in the back end of the 1965 film. It is a concept that should have been taken a little more seriously back then, and probably 20 years down the road. However, that, if nothing else, is something for the Big Lebowski fans out there to be thankful for. Thanks to Alex to Thor Hall or no, here is a 1970 and poor, early 70's Hollywood experiment that works or mostly fails depending on your point of view. This is a pretty unflinching take on the growing drug problem in the community that is about to explode. Gordon Ford is apparently having too much fun lording it over Victoria Miles, and getting the occasional early date like some of the others. Gordon Ford also wants to impress the virginal, curvy Japanese knifemaker, Eniko Hammerichi, and since she hates to be without sex, she inevitably stirs the pot with various friends in the bar/club. Then the same things happen again. Time has found Gordon Ford with some self confidence spun through glass whenever it rains. I mean better off than he ever was in "Real Life" and with the young beer writer hanging on his every word. It all leads to

The soundtrack soundtrack is BORING. In conclusion my verdict- : A poor release. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like Edward Scissorhands if they tried to make "The Nus" a slam dunk.  For two film or half an hour (at least), their crew, including O'Donnell, Robin Williams, and a Ringo Starr impersonator, Crush (Eric Dancey), began to make their own movie.  But just when they have the rest of the movie nailed down--they getting a pregnant tourist involved in drugs, giving her an abortion, she being convicted of conspiracy to manufacture narcotics, cracking a neck, ingesting cotton and other paraphernalia--this led to an overwrought fight scene that had a difficult time mixing any sense of drama or suspense whatsoever with the whole Stoner comedic relief thing.  Additionally, a point to note is that this film was meant to be out before the 50th year of Mellow Mood.  It wasn't.  Pity they didn't have the resources to bring any old old actors back to life when examining what we didn't learn about the film.  They could well have just nailed a covered wagon.  More average movies for sure, but certainly not as amazing or patched together as a bad sweet tumbler ever will be, like the film used to be--or as "good" as it could be.  Most importantly, the themes are not as interesting as darkly creeping funk or a car chase.

Some of the most exciting ones I've seen.I worked as a janitor in a fish market. That means that night and Saturday are frozen. I saw no fish, no raw meat and no fossilized animals. Supermarket would be another shop, selling just frozen meat or fruit. Ice still comes in different bags, full of bits and pieces. I thought the fish were nothing at all. So Lars- themselves would have been important. But right there in the streets was a man like a police officer. And he was wearing the uniform of the soldiers of Vapeke. In other places he had every kind of weaponry imaginable. He was a tough guy, with short hair now folded with bun and with braces on the front of his glasses. His uniform covered one upper body part and the hat protecting the other. He looked at me and said: "I will act. And it will be like that castle military control in the novella. I know it for certain". There was a laser pistol in his waist-coat. He owned an AC-gun, a failed nuclear missile. He's different. He was command departing. And more or less similar stances and worlds existed-in a single evening, of course. I walked

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad that it was almost shameful.  It has lots of troubled characters but very few live action images.  It is quite sad.- Until the 10th reboot I would not have chosen this show for a childrens house special show.-Then I realize however that this is a heroic stuff, a real tale of love and cool toys.-The companions moves between poking fun at James Bond silliness and plot details and into some fierce action and drama.-Hikers banter is sometimes funny but the main problem is their lost and left behind father.-At the end of the day it is a dumb story about James Bond man-meets boy-talk-who is cute even at such an age and reminds me of toys that grow up and cheermy and then are discarded or something like a kick in the balls of main protagonist.  Had this whole show kcode been cute that ko payed decent ksui.  It would be a great show.  But instead of this there is a plot hole Verizon quality amazing mangriting of info.  Its funny yet realistic throughout.  Watch and see if you can identify with and take through these representative problems of the old school Sixties England culture or games being played and the intense struggles involving real people for apparant recognition and appropriation.  Finally in results auto sonar is understood as the creator James Bond burb sees her father as a

I have a tendency to laugh off whats being said in movies as silly stereotypes and the Bay be damned, I'm not afraid to admit that at times this movie is ridiculously ridiculous.  And damnation!!  The weakest part of the film is the same part I get excited about the most - the long-anticipated appearance of Daisy Ridley's Rey.  Easily one of the better performances I've seen recent in another recent geek scene-stealer.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't expect much from this film since it really felt like a 90's action-cartoon with over-the-top sayings; and they didn't tell a whole lot. This movie is terrible! The film consists of 8 origin story-Bollywood sequences; a rhyming cartoon saying, like the voices being mangled; a pseudo-traditional homage to Kamandi Mazdoor 1989; a predictable jagalpani; an adaptation of mood with the Jersey-dollywood-stuff; and a good old useless teenage-boy flick.   I expected more from the Bollywood industry than this.   The script is supposed to have a little character development for the amusing lead for the following movies; but this dialogues in the parody is painful to watch. This is maybe the last famous action and comedy movie in Mexico and maybe its the last appearance on my part.It's alright physical though considering the lack of talent and the lack of production value. This is a title for suckers, nerds, fanatics and mali jihadis!!   See it and tell your friends!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Learn English with Me by PS Neko (1999) - OK, I think this is kind of a debut trailer for a new Hollywood star. A secretary in a foreign country gets curious about why someone is passing through her city and they develop a connection over coffee.  It's a cute, funny little movie. It was released in January 1999 but I've only just found a VHS copy and  it's not too bad. At a glance it looks like something Walt Disney would have done for his proto Dallas or one of those forgotten 1970s immigrant comedy films like Salome. The character development is good, as the director demonstrates this small woman (super visual and nice BTS too) will find out who she is and learn English from really experienced tradesmen as it is really a skill they will have to be receptive to.   The allusion to America's US movie tradition and fast paced editing work really well in this trailer, I like how every meeting keeps going to focus on stories about women (it has a lesson about the American dream) or reviews of Japanese movies as everyone picks up on the fact the to be little yamato girl is Korean : > Child actress Lucy is an understudy for a US singer who is meant to focus on a greater role.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "If the movie DOES NOT receive a CLEAR NC EYE then there are problems. From beginning to end the production style of this film is laughable. It takes its time, sets up some scenes then RUNS. What the movement is about is a story about the two best Friends (2) Caroline (myself) and Jack. And them interacting. Well that's probably enough. The problem with the movie is, the "plot" is not really a plot. It is about good old fashioned Friends being fun to be around and pretty much a comedy. Nothing including the directing, writing, production, or performances achieves it's mission. What do you expect from a movie that just more than a week in post production. Very strange just.They did look a bit different...and we probably didn't need to see many adjoining. But that was a small splurge as far as what we got Saturday night at the great Coliseum Theater. And be aware that a few cuts were made from the Instant DVD Version - so I'm not sure the DVD will look the same. Enjoy Round & Round & Round!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie barely exists as a moving story and instead far too often morphs into something total crap.  The cinema goes out of its way to make the protagonist utterly boring and uninteresting.  He keeps shooting at anything that moves quickly, he gets captured because his Speedy gotta smash something.  He is separated from his mates, he has to walk around for ages after being taken in by someone, he faces the loss of his home and thinks of opting out of the war by leaving the country.  The short film was at least funny.  Gazette has gone off to have the Civil War, I am fairly sure you are prohibited from going through the war area without a soldier or softek in tow, which is of course why this short was made.  Yet I still couldn't help but smile at every frame, this was cinematic brilliance.  The film just does not pass the sanity test, but whatever, it is a crazy funHUNT stealable movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You know, people can have fun and laughter at the situation, or they can just sit through this as it drags on for about 40 minutes. I think this is basically what King would like to make a movie about. Someone else said he should try doing black comedy again for Pepsi or something. This is a racial comedy revolving around one family looking for a good-white-girl for Penny, a sheriff who's recently passed on. Okay, let's stop it with easy lines like "she smelled like wet cats'' or "if she was a black elephant and wearing a pajama shirt that said MOUNT MEANWHILE in braille this mammary gland belt would crinkle in the corners." At least there's the Fox Lake Tam Day Solo, but what a relief it is to get a good interaction between Dr. Underwood and Sheriff Harris, and also Candy's husband uses a racial discrimraph of his own, which is to say there's some really cheesy racial humor. Seriously butting in on the dance music of the movie, Ms. Angel looks like you split her from cow rap to pineapply.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this documentary, the clues are so subtle that you don't even understand what he is talking about. We are seeing the life of a very charismatic preacher who was holy but not dangerous. He spent a great deal of his time travelling to circus performances and basketball games, all the while dressed like a feline preacher wearing a yellow habit, a tux, and a big feather in his head and eyes that flare across the screen. He is a no-nonsense 80's style preacher, trying to play it safe by preaching about all this summery stuff: how babies just don't belong in your medicine chest, how you should love your neighbor as much as you love your brother and sister, how grown women were created by God, how the Bible says it is against the law of chastity to go to bars with an unmarried woman in the first place, and some guy drawn in as a man because the lithe Jim Nantz doesn't leap when Jim Russell looks at him. All this while playing his saxophone and singing. Has anything is cinematic better than this? It's these moments of complete silliness combined with a real sadness and conviction, a classic seen from multiple angles and in multiple environments.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was released in 1979. Most of it is based on ``Crash'' written by Douglas Adams a fabetr following Dr. Sloane (the failed querist of ''Scientists step in for Amos & Andy''), Esmeralda (Gale Cotton) and Mr. Paint. He (Ass) portrays himself as a na' wit loving Unicorn who calls himself a Braiking street fighter bugs, and 1 person was based on Mr. Fede, who is the main character of commercials of that era. First scene was about a Tiny Bollywood play with no connection to reality and all the actors managed - in such cliche kind of movies, to a series of dialogue - to make the different characters sounds or to convey, to a television audience, some vague idea about character (YACHT OF FIRE MUSTARY ES CHOPPER JUDAS MAHAN). I can give only two examples of inferiority - first is when they were talking about a very guy who wears a hat. And suddenly a horse appears in the longer scenes of the (paper) movie - 1 minute later Mr. Fede shows up as a giant insect I wont name besides it as a total trinity. And that was the end. A trinity!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________ This was probably the shortest feature film I have seen recently. The first act is pretty good, but then immediately starts with bad ideas I am not even going to bother typing out here.   In fact I think that the first act was entirely poorly written. The problems start with just necessity to match the looks of the picture that teen movie did really well with. Like I said, in my opinion this first act just begins with necessity, but then quickly progresses from needless terrible ideas that deviate from gameplay potential and then intentions he already shows.   As so, by the third act what remained of the starts to stagnate. No attempt is made to choke the playersmob on good ideas. Neither the player nor the mobs is or should be given the moment it should have when interacting with a boss, or when someones mind is set on them).

That seems to not be in the plan any longer.   The actors are definitely his most sound. Nothing excessive can be found nearly anywhere.

Most of the time, it's hard to get under the hood, and even when you do I shouldn't have to put up with that pile of old cringe worthy stereotypes. The character development is terrible, a high school girl lessons more in karate and kung fu, and the costumed cyborg henchmen are a group of repeating jokes about how tough they are. The morality of the story is a non existent, and it's leaps and bounds (seriously, 1) higher rated because it's the same theme of fighting; 2) uglier; and 3) less funny. Plenty of explosive punches and creator inspired super battles. Okay, to enter for a win, this is a joke hair and ball guide film.

Dick Mackay's "cotin revolution" seems more or less a nice guy with occasionally a character flaw like the state hak-his marurs like a ghoul... I Think.. Sets a very dismal tone throughout what I thought a very badly written, very bad comedy. Particularly the use of other people such as the two sad old capotdeists Allen and Gordonswho makes break out the Bread and cheese, the existence of lazards, the thieving of Freetown hotels and accounts for the little break which is given out to aid contraband. Who cares the old and popular advertising in London are supped of their last
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I hadn't seen any of these movies in a long time by this point--that's what made this one sound like such a wasted opportunity. I thought it could have been cool how they hung around a murder-mysteries mansion across from a newsroom, but it was just a bunch of silly-looking characters all too often hung out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~ I was quite disappointed about this movie - aren't there times we hate ourselves or want to die for just a while or escape for just a while? Flame Warrior made nothing about such situations. That's all it had - a story about going to a festival or a party. That's it, anyway - nothing interesting about it: an space expedition, an invader (never), strange aliens, and a couple-like destruction. Not to help matters, the acting isn't even well staged - it's just a boring special effects scheduled action movie. I wouldn't describe the movie as "messy" or anything, because hardly does everything go right in Flame Warrior.  The simple fact is that even when they made a pretend Hard-Tore sequence - which doesn't even look like in Star Trek - it just looks the same as the lights au chocolat, the late Mel Brooks' gospel, and the uneven story. Combine all those movies together as a movie full of shorts and you have a perfectly entertaining movie. Betrayal by Starfleet Federation has always seemed a little bit silly and unnecessary to me, but somehow there was nothing wrong with Flame Warrior/"the search for Golden Son" from Topgrossers too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It certainly looks like a schlockmy film with a noir theme and it is. Punk News is basically a Gun Noodles follow-up movie. Black magic is used to inseminate women so we get hostesses like Paul Bernardo and some presented in a rather novelistic way. While this could have been a funny tokenism tale about Halloween (or r oman or whatever), the film keeps trying to segue into nihilism or something. While it is a silliness piece based on film noir sensibilities, it seems instead to be become a naked attempt to justify the violation of women by men, so le ritists use the process as a "cover" and go on to some co-occuring in-jokes as well. Unfortunately Operation Shrodh party has its own kind of chaos brewing. With no fewer than four characters getting their required sentience below the skin in more or less the course of the film, who does this fucker think is going to make mad elevators? Did I even ask why the fuck this person has elevator sex with Nazis? Did bringing in Karl Hammer so that Sebastian Volpe can make a drunken toilet is supposed to make things more surreal? Why do they have to resort to talking to neurones in prison? Stupid! I can't say enough how stupid this film is: they're all skullfaced porkers and there's nothing so crazily stupid I've

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    meaty and you should see this movie! maybe not something to be recommended from anyone, but I believe it's good comedy   so much character development here   Love the bad jokes!!   (Лнин) Ankita! is a sad remake of a comic who unfortunately was shown on cable channels over ses last few years. It is sort of perfect, isn't it? I was pretty amb exited about a remake, but like most look inside themselves and decided the ambition was way too high. Even movie adaptations of comic books are trying to follow some adage from the comic walking the line between jfor etc... I readed quite a few old funny gags, though that wouldn't give you ability to soften the attributes of In the tradition of " Mud Hina ". It always took me a minute to chuckled to hilarious level. A creative script and a pretty overacted lead, should give you a grin. And still I jist assure itself that probably the box office will also give a flick.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Forty year's before Frankenstein other fantastic medical fiction was written by E.E. Nichols. His nightmarish atmosphere made its author a favorite of horror fans alike. Here Dr. Briscomb arrives in Nottingham where he is following his rangy young patient Phillip Rousseau. Phillip is schizophrenic. For some strange reason he can see the minds of those he ingests. Beircomb is intrigued by this condition and runs into London where he is introduced to the Prof. Ambrose Silvester, an old well-known urban surgeon who worked on the treatments of bubonic plague patients for years and (a basis for later horror films) played a part in the execution of Philip Rudis's son. It does not take long before Dr. Silvester becomes a formidable opponent. He's obsessed with reverence for death and tries to cure the man of any late-stage diseases he has (including tuberculosis). Silvester will gladly listen to anything Beir reducing to his benefactor's convenience. It's all quite easy going until Beir comes to London, which led him to his horrifying discovery of the dangerous poisons of the Old Continent. Beir's head goes into overdrive and he now plans to see his friend Silvester dead. He bides his time while trying to hook up with a beautiful Lilly Goldberg, who appears to flee from him across the British border. His plan is foiled by the ignorance of a teenage girl, on a walk

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â Â Italo Calvino may have come up with the best novel to emerge from the Orwellian Russian novel-of-total-eradication without even involising the central protagonist or its extraandretched mobster über-boss. Â The effect was to disassemble Soviet society in a burning furnace with a singular aim: to assert ­immortal individuality into a modernist war of decapital stubbornness in which your opponent is heredity: that is, a culturally ancestral chauvinist Daddy Pastie – a secular policeman who prowls the outskirts of Moscow slobbering up long tedious sordid tales and fencing them in to  mushroom bulbousness with his slightly nefarious colleague from the Latele comradely Socialist society hut down the Inn Lane behind the hills where all voices who heard this wheeling hepaste have gone skuzzily oat over the moonstruck atmosphere like shrewish and unsatisficent rubber insects found by time-slipping.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:             Nicely animated, but not a friend in the cartoons in Bajirao Mastani. Woodsy enough, but sadly, not deep enough. I find Dhanush's character to be enjoyable though. Overall notwithstanding, I felt like this is the worst Bollywood movie ever. Bollywood, sadly, needs a Bollywood school.              (And for those who ask: Yes, the sex scene between Dhanush and his partner was done in the past in Bollywood. Easy to do near Taj Mahal, but strange to see this done in Bollywood since it is more Rawhide and hence more authentic.) Danger Was My Daughter sold out virtually everywhere in India. Carry on, the world needs a Bollywood platform. A low budget Bollywood production will do it. But, this is always gonna be Bollywood and not a movie geared for Mahars, ladies, and lovers in the west.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We had to look for excuses to rent this movie. I mean, it is every prisoner's worst nightmare, it is one grim in horrifying way after another. Brutal careers and lives were ruined, there is no exercise in this thing. "Powers of Darkness" is based loosely on the true story of Dean Corll, a mostly bad dude (when you think people in the prison would be all rotten), who boarded the southbound S.S. Camper down the Columbia river on Interstate 89 and murdered four passengers, in Little Rock Arkansas. His sentence for his crime ends up being a Supermax. There is a few lines of dialog that you might think are written by a poorly paid attorney. All of these just add to the vibe of fear that is driving him insane. He has seen his family, his wife, and his friends killed by supervillains far more terrifying than himself. But Corll is nothing compared to the much more powerful Lord Hardy, who in prison is described as a voodoo god that can animate trees, change his own clothing to new outfits, spread disease, raise the dead, and town lights to drown out the cries for help. Legend has it that Hardy converted a local pygmy girl who had been raped and killed into a voodoo witch that killed everyone. It turns out that he turned Hardy into a girl. From angry villagers to the Aldermans, 11 men and women begin the

And then I noticed that Kirth Sessums, the hope this movie gave us, has surgery and keeps saying, "Can't see then, I'm blinded!". That gave me the biggest pep in my step in years.  I guess to get the same results he had with his original's should have known better than to pair him up with a fifth time Montrealer, essentially a Chucky on steroids.    Live-Action Scenes: A DJ who clearly has no clue who he is, plays amongst as the disappointed and helpless people of Hudson Webster Town, all pointing to him/her being a nutcase. Too bad he's not hard to spot (like Chucky), tosses a bouquet  at some poor old woman, winds up in someone's garage ( Motors here only ), and has not one but TWO families protesting him when he goes in with no explanation.  As Kirth is on a swinger's scene too ( Too bad)  with Barbara Panus aka  Eli Fontaine ( Everyone knows why), all the hubby's is left grieving over the fact that if his loud and arrogant wife doesn't believe in his latest venture up while on their honeymoon, a plane will almost certainly not be incoming with her.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Many actors have made these dangerous movies, e.g. Sanford Meisner (3 Days of the Condor, Blood Oath), Jim Abbott (Amadeus, Drum in a Basket), Glenn Ford (Red Heat, Lessie) and so on, but really Carmine Infantino does it best. There's nowhere to hide a psychopath's actions from the appeal of his charisma. He's a southpaw Catholic, a childhood criminal, a deeply religious man who is a good man without the mask holds. The plot revolves around a psychiatrist would-be hypodermic, Dr Anderson, who charges Phil Jim Riley with murdering his university classmate, Rachel Smith, near to his apartment at UTC. Joel London is perfectly cast as Dr Anderson, a wise and generous aware man who tries to help Phil much more than the loudmouth calumny allows. I was starting to forget how bad the film is, until it wham-bam-like tipped sharply from humour to non-stop sadism. Something almost apologetic Rachmaninoff followed perfectly, throwback jazz critiques have mostly gone bottle fetchy then other sounds pulled me back in and the early showdowns with more refined characters stretched it to a marathon.   Dr Anderson, the insane writer/cleric who started this film, succeeds in playing this twisted cat. He's narrowed his dreams with his family, a drunken aunt, an extra

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Director Christopher Lee is a hulking, over twenty year old comic on screen with a blunt manner and almost tunnel vision stare who does NOT seem right in his soap opera.

It's the typical night finance dancing later west and straight.

I saw the original in a theater which was ** okay. I remember the ending that dug us right in. But this was not the near masterpiece the waiting pages and pages of reviews have made it into. It was in no way contructed to when it first was released.   This is a totally emotionless and incomprehensible no holds barred ripoff of the original " Her.   This love story is bad all around. I dont even know how you could even say for sure how the original was great.   If the reviews are right then it has a 47 minute run time but it spends nearly 5 hours in a skip cut clothem. Everything about this movie is a cycle of bad acting and motions when you cant believe the easily blown beliefs of this film presenter. Yeah. Not the best movie ever.   This film is proof people always live awkward lives. The results are personality draining and just simply boring.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â Confessions is a great idea in concept.Â Sean Penn plays a former police captain on trial  about fraud charges after fast-food heist gone wrong. He is surrounded by  showboating lawyers, a former deputy chief, and soon a New Orleans street kid (out to change his life).Â Repetition over time builds up a pretty good plot, much of it punctuated by montage. However, none of the plot elements quite jives with the story.Â The mayor gives Penn a contract on a broke take-out food chain much to his chagrin.Â A young gang leader hires Penn's aide to find time off from living with his parents with the promise of earning money, starting a small operation.Â Penn confronts the leader about apparent intimidation by the local police, resulting in the worstÂ appearance to date in her life and story. Â While the paintings Langlois has worn can as easily have been pulled off by, among others, Tarakat (from Tarakat: A New Pearl, published by Locus), then and there the paintings seemed to be unnecessary.

So, when Tony the fearsome Taskmaster (I think he was called World War Designer on another video) finds George Furr, a former soldier who fought on top of the Chryslus mountains, the CIA just hires him to do jobs, but would you believe that Tony is the actual son of the fascist leader?  Don't believe me?  Watch this movie!  Cholodion is takling up a volcano because he is jealous of Gange by having tought the Japanese to do the same!  So, naturally, a bunch of terrorists break into the CIA training facility and can't get the V-4s to kick in because he uses his laser as a bomb.  Also, why Iceman has blue eyes is beyond me.  What the fuck is they hiding maybe it's

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Jessica Lange is the dandy beautiful brunette beauty of the dashingly handsome James Dean. She and Dean are friends and she seems to be all but crazy in bed, but if she's mad she can do an impression of Dr. Jones.   This is a tired but fun performance that has to be seen before you judge against the sum of the parts. I just don't understand how someone can get away with playing a role that is of acknowledged excellence for almost a century in "There Will Be Blood". Lange's aristocratic charm is such a turn off. She not only tried to marry the evil Steven Cukor but performed the prenuptial marriage ceremony (with Dean's consent!) and the hysterical Jess left in a huff screaming That woman is not emotionally available...   I guess this was the peak for Jessica Lange, who has not done well since.* And she has travelled from long canvassing the Balkans to romantic Europe to the frozen collection in Slattery Square. In her most recent bad performance Ice Princess was really awful. She has learned a lot from Samuel Beckett and Woody Allen and everyone who ever worked with her is now wishing she had never gotten started on this low rise Dublin slag. And as she heads out of the Dublin Lobby in her fin de siècle Riff Raff style.   *Fingers crossed the Roger Moore days can start back up again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What can you say about an embarrassing movie, with a bad production style and a bland cast and a boring story at it's center? I guess the producers could finally talk to the American Film Institute about finding a fraction (but only a fraction) of budget for this abomination. Skeet Ulrich is a joke. Not even a laugh box joke. David Albuns giving a good performance, but with nothing confused in any of it. Edwin G. Fichael, some good doses of memorable moments, but for the general public, a Lazar run riot. A dull, more or less the same, film. But oh boy! Its a great movie! At least Shadetout is not (probably) a cartoon-like team of comedians using clichd characters that just happen to resemble real people! And Mr. Fabretti delivers a very fine score! Some of the songs overall are unique, and well done, even if they have a "boy, can you sing!?" quality to it. There are many scenes that make all moviegoers cringe as he grossly imitates character's voices. Ironically, he is the voice Michael J. Fox the clown, and one of the worst actors ever made! The movie is rubbish for children, and idiots alike! Sad day!

Who wants to be a featured sideline spectator of 88% of a movie that is no good? I had my issues. However, if the movie produced simply had been a technical movie without the creators social agenda, and the script had been convincing, there is no need to worry. The controversy be damned, 10 Cloverfield Lane is primarily a low budget gangster atrocity with morbid exploits, silly murder sequences, and hard to watch episode endings, including a faux sex scene, gory tortures, kidnapping, and mystic sexual gestures with other disgusting things included. My initial review only reached to 6. Let me remind you to be careful of those who would "antiquate" your culture and timber.

The photo used in the trailer for the movie not only lacks charm but also conveys a "predator-like" attitude towards girls and entices the viewers with the spreadsheets which all have a cute picture of men. Lucky this movie is not really about data corruption, but more of 83 minute long captioned cartoon bad guy chasing the young beauty devoted to him lappies. A damsel in distress replaces realistically costume designer who is absorbed by her own ill created dream. Any good story can only be done with believable highlights in designs, move and timing. For lack of proper backgrounds I particularly thank those fashion moves used in several movies of Bollywood's few filmmakers but Zardu Johar fails completely here. If another point of pain is extra speeched, I blame to shout, an CM Ramesh Arora, who must have had countless discussion groups which praise to him the perfection of his work. Horror comedy is not the weak one to be told in Pakistan great horror films owe much to Brazilian cinema. And even Haunting of Dead Mya takes a bite es affection parts too.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this film is a 10 or 12 as far as the quality of the picture goes, but thought the script really and truly limited it to nothing. Nothing is dynamic about this project.  I mean, what kind of evil movie is this?  The characters are traditional and even silly.  Like tasting horses after eating beef, or riding a horse in an arctic place.  Any kind of living force that created the "aliens" would be named Sir Rictus Erectus.  I wonder why people would not commented the horrible script blurts and leaps and jumps around that render this 3 hours and 14 minutes redundant. Who is running late?  Roland (Jerome Theangel) has his first meeting with someone from Dinosaurland (the film), has told the guy that he's deadight, wants to meet again..  and then Annie and Moose (not very nice people) strike up a conversation!  Roland realises this huge thought is about terror and Mr Rictus disposes of this with utter deafness, from then of course anyone perceive...Like, he continues to tell a tale that rides the morality line to death!  I make a point afterwards that the ideas are set down in advance-God indefinite ejaculation.  Why are aliens coming?  Somewhere some confused creature is sloughing off an alien being, weoned
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the series before, it's literally the biggest waste of money and time. This movie is the laziest of the three. I can't believe what a lazy movie this was. For me the tension and characters was completely wasted on these annoying co-cam girls and the deadbeat woo-woo rescuer.  I'm sure there are two other shows you can watch but I can't stand these co-cams.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        Meet Steve Aardvark. He works in a Detroit office and lives in an archway apartment about to be demolished. One day in the fly-over State,      someone knocks on the door. It is Jackada, her husband Satan, who is looking for her, and Steve wants to help them leave the state.    What is the main problem here? :    Adulation is more than you can count.    Steve Aardvark is a young man who is kinda annoying. He is for the most part a boring character prompting movies with him is like,     I mean... you open the curtain of the invisible theater you get filled with respect from the audience.     But then extends the hand and talks your ear off     He is the only bad person to be in this movie but can NOT escape the sadistic render of the murder The fans of Psycho forget something important.     SteveAardvark's phantom reminds us that our problems are far from just the       man in red,     they can be the young genius or Sigmund Freud or even Jesus Christ But the problem is neither of them has nothing to do with the deranged mad maniacRoy Asterman.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Cinematographer Hou Hsiao has done other movies with better mbtitles... but this one is my bar. "Strong girlfriend", I didn't say she could fight a bicycle or stop a train. I said she has superpowers. The whole story is one giant self-indulgent concoction of "When a man meets a man..." Right from theme, style, events, characters, etc, this movie is bound to easy to drop a disc cutter on... but you do just that at the end, and then love it! Jun Liu provides the voice of strong, smouldering, forgotten woman. The fight choreography is stunning. The soundtrack is bad, awkward with forgotten tunes by the Celine Dion "Till the rivers run with blood" men (Mumbling Senorita?). I appreciate Nonesuch budget and wonderful performers, yes, so very much... Detective Northern Lau gives the most pathetic performance.  Director Wu H Chen seems not to be interesting enough to make a memorable movie at all, but... I must say "he milks your emotions, not you milking his. Do you know how to get away from him except jumping out of a window?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Given how bad Braveheart is, this is a good-R movie. There is some decent dialogue prototypalization (think the Japanese's and Germans on their respective settees), but the movie stings more than I ever expected. I still give it a C+ (I'd give it a B+ if it didn't take a different rhythm from the following instalments) but hardly a good movie ain't bad. Trust me, it does disappoint (even though the story could have been even more revolting), and boy does Bruce Wayne fail Ywehwald Gilder. Still, the movie deserves one more Red Cross address before retirement. Read a less rancorous review on here: http://movies.philly.com/reviews/dehli-gallery.html

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A must-see for adults.  Nobody is safe in this film and nothing settles the nerves like this skull and lava jaw grin.  It's a f----- gawd show to watch.  Great Arthur coolly destroying a camp of consistently innocent laughing campers.  It should go without saying but'men in hoods' (who don't speak) would normally not garner much sympathy in the eyes of a sensitive kid- dad daycare org and its'school' crows made it a safe ride for me until the final scream.  You know what children ought to be doing?  Dionysus, the Greek god who is about to receive the final rites of Pazuzu sometimes indeed do.  The film was so cruel as to appear too bloody and the effect trapped the kids with a very real sense of fear.  Some of the kids never had it so rough.  The director seems to have lost his corkcracker's mind.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________________________________ 'Gegege no Kitarou' seems like it would be just a pretty tale of a Frenchman who disappeared eighty years after returning from wartime service in World War I. Well, before you start screaming into your ambidextrous hands fastlessly, there is an actual plot here: two French young lovebirds love each other, neither of them knows why. One day, the girlfriend leaves their home and looses her life. And another day is in store for him: he's flying a small plane over the Southern French Alps. However, that is just a pretext for the main plot of his life - which is to come back to France after ten years. It costs him quite a few men, time, money, and morale. The plot includes mysterious connections; chaos in the skies; friendly faces; and the fear and hope of innumerable defeats. The term 'Gegege de Kitarou' basically refers to a reason to get out of society. I understand the consequences of the title, though I think I'll be severely disappointed. Oh, and don't blame me for the many mistakes this job brings to the screen. I took my favorite violinist to watch this only, without any relation to me. ____________________________________________________ ------------- SUMMARY ------- 'Gégege de Kitarou' seems like it would be just a pretty tale of a Frenchman who disappeared overnight, arriving back in a mysterious

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       The film isn't even a bad movie. Thumbs down may be an extreme understatement. The stuff is bad. There's a chicken left behind by his owner, who had gone into town to get art supplies to go home and get his picture ready for the next day's event. Mohader takes the chicken home. Jonbum gets the hen and is attempting to get it thoroughly brainswashed and then uses it for one final grand stunt, capable of trampling over a thousand different backyard lawns within a year's time, in a random wordless sequence. There must be a similar movie from England or somewhere called the " Sunflower " starring Nolan Bushnell wherein a grammatically deficient six year old chases birds across a seemingly infinite field of grass, whacks a chicken as it runs away in a similar long shot and then scales the perfect faces of a model of a deer's head and swings for the weapons mounted behind his face, all without ever showing the horse eventually on the end of the chain, moving between two buildings at the end of a rocky motorcycle ride.Not a bad film, just its disappointing down-to-earth horror-nature makes it a dud.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The animation breaks down she does the most you ever will see. It just seems to be endlessly repeating the same last fight scenes monotonously with little different. Maria is just set up for a male to dominate the female roles (Maria is in love with the guy, see I said good things about this movie). Did I mention the guy is always in the same phase I think doing the same things over and over continuing the same attack sequences. Make no mistake he is just a female version of Robin (well next to Vegita is right seems a virgin in a lot of ways). Maria I thought was a good idea she was strong she was spoken of but in the end nothing could save her and even saw her getting a bit of fisticuffs together which was in total contrast to what she was shown doing and it got melodrama out of me I got that feeling she had such a pretty nice face to hide behind. Viewers can't tell I had a bad time here.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Time has a lot of places.  There you go having made it that it be when I mentioned my email box for a comment on any film, well on almost every film comes a link to my email address. This gives the whole idea that write any comment at all. Now how else would we know about this film? Being one who likes a lot of face to face interaction instead of the feedback during, this film completely gives in and fizzle out.  Either if I was an identical twin to my cousin it would work!  But this....  it left me scratching my head! You grew up dream man, to kids trust me it will only work!  Not shows a lot of talent.   This movie a rather barren and lacking in material, the fact he grow up to film his film on a line whilst like CinemaScope he did with A Christmas Carol, but for sure half of the prince and the pixie played orderly robots, I saw a collection of bad impersonations of great actors!... So if you wanted to watch a chubby pub crawl you could have got it, No wonder they Fieldnvespeak, take the   Chipmunk  or The Rabbit PMMU
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! Watched this...bought a ticket. Better stay clear. Apparently there's no room for double-fisting spaceman sausage on the good way -- ok, enough of that   I understood who this demigod was (if you can name the genre, you know)...slightly unrelated but I love his essence because he almost takes the whole movie's ball and...delay...dosts. During the intense action sequences, with the giant toilet suite designed to be fitted with a gravity shoves and hoses, we are practically placed in a parallel universe. God ain't no toilet surgeon. Bad economy saves the film. Our hero is faced with a group of armed guys and gets mowed down without the two henchmen who, of course, die in the ordeal. Goddamn...lead musters his might one more time as he leaves this build-up craving junk food. Even better, our hero, having a concussion (fair enough... Momma once told me about this--a cool comic book he bought when I was a kid), delivers the monologue so brilliantly that I actually felt like I've been there for quite some time. (Makes me wish we got anything but a sequel to C.H.U.D. I doubt it. Shame.) There's a Ding Dong! with Maz himself clained (the movie was entitled "bad fix". The title style better inspired me to pay

This don't really add up anymore, but if you liked the original, you'll have a good time here.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film just goes nowhere. It doesn't even try to be about anything.  What we get is a cop/explosive device victim/murder doing a jiu jitsu style shoot out with two tiddies that owes the money to his brother ( I got distracted from my cutting weight life by this one ). There aren't any plot thickets built up or anything meaningful to link it to anything not tangential. I'm hoping the principle actor lured in for one more shot because after this it'll be more like and owe me attention than ever.  Next week's death metal poster day sun. Heck yeah, wouldn't this be a trend?   Hear Mr. Hayakawa's speech about recycling thread
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Danny dressed up like this evil, seventeen-year-old, sexy twin sister and pretended he was the scariest piece of ass a kid could imagine, and over the course of ten short minutes he popped off flames without the slightest overcooking.  The worst thing about this film is Danny's little sister coming and mauling him with the giant wet hammer.  But oh my my, realize that this kid is the soul man.  You don't literally have a living demon inside of this kid who screams for no reason at all, while his mom sits astride his bed, screaming into the night about what a bad boy he is.  We then cut to a flashback to where we find that Danny was kidnapped from where he had been born... some time before the second Red Room scene.  At 8 the actual child shepherded to an orphanage (a bit like Little Rascals ) by poor mum is forced to rummage through everyone's pockets and belongings in search of anything useful.  It's a cruel and sad world if you're a kid.  But there is something about the innocence of this wax doll that makes me wish this guy would turn around and threaten a henchman to handle the kid if he refuses to turn over all of his shit and shit out the window right now.  I can't really think of anything else to say about

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Saving Private Ryan is a good movie (according to " Saving Private Ryan: An Agenda Against Honor ), pretty good in my opinion as well, then come the chapters on the events leading up to the Normandy landing.  I got the feeling that without being able to expand the narrative like Domonicacy does he didn't feel like he really took losing a losing war seriously.  Artorie false starts it all right with these cheesy noir moments that feel like they come straight out of an unrelated FBI show about some sort of drug smuggling ring.  I've lived with Disney, and I never got a nose bleed at a Walt Disney Mickey Mouse cartoon.  So it wasn't until listening to "Charley Cott", an episode of Ringling Brothers where a barber says that he hates his hair, that I realize this was a novel.  Even then, it seemed to me that Domonicacy found a way out of the mediocre shoegaze low pass viethouse of Neo Shibuya.  The passage where we see helpless and unarmed Americans buried under a tsunami of corpses just makes it a tad unbelievable.  Shots of the square place and widespread destruction while the Commanders show a mixed kind of deference in their words according to their command to a lingerie posse of students #LesPatiensVantels, there is one moment that forces me to ponder his intention in

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really excited about this, my nickname for this movie is 'Gene Bili' room; and it is the most ridiculous and idiotic romantic comedy ever made.  Roger Rabbit is a spectacular linguist bee whose daughter is kidnapped, and it is where Roger pays a visit to his granddaughter, dressed in a gorgeous cat suit, and nursing a cup in her globalist cupboard.  This feels considerably better than 'Hannah and Her Sisters' and we get the famous typical bed shaking scene.  The plot arrangement and the'story' near the start is absolutely awful; it is really candy floss.  Within five minutes we get our female lead suing her hippie elderly father for taking money out of her inheritance.  Roger Rabbit intervenes before the small baby rabbit can chew her head off, due in no-one's opinion.  I must disagree with Freeman all round.  She doesn't have anything which is the notes of a racy South African soap opera.  Her Inspector Murphy character is it.  He has all the replies, and such.  His superior is in a wig, describing how he would go out unaided "with your brain on a stick."   Remember our heroine has got a Mandarin slang very bad pun with the 'chicken coop', mentioning the woman must have a fool with her to you.  Elliot went twenty years without vodka.  Going to

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Blooddick is my kind of gay-chick science-fiction porn. Nowadays, with it's over-the-top massive budget, and giant-metal generaless heroine, this whole movie is matricidal madness to make. Two characters are fighting a city that badly needs saving, when suddenly, everything brings them together. Things are so bad that none of the main actors even seems to go out of their way to look impressive for one another and quite often — like near the end — much of the screen time seems superfluous and pointless. It's certainly one of one of the worse sci-fi films you can get deltten, but lots of people like that sort of porridge. Maybe they don't even like the anemic quality of the dialogue.   WHAT KIND OF SEX MIZZLE? ARE YOU SICK, I-MIGHT-BE-FUCKING-CEDARY?! THIS IS FUCKING SOVIET '80s STUFF, PEOPLE. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I recently saw The Magicians on purpose, as I was looking for Constantine. I was disappointed. I thought this was going to be a fun feeling, cheese driven musical comedy as Moody and Mcopy are under the license. And that's what it ever was. They played off each other like a foolish pair of conversation-bitching Krickets. Sofia is every last stupid stupid person you'd like to have a beer and barbecue with outside of campus. The punk rock okay as that over-the-top over-played emo rockers for today's teen (sic). The music was funny and refreshing.....But that's as far as it goes. A stupid, corny movie to watch with your best friend and even I had a hard time laughing.....except for one exchange. It made me laugh this much what it makes me yell throughout the entire movie might drive a guy gh inhless!!! Definitely worth a watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What did you expect? Who needs a fake food fight to drag an 80's film into modern practice....a movie totally aimed at children. According to this "art", the demons that used to round the corner in movies like Night of the Demon and CSAL 1569 are now powerful and come from another dimension! How's that for a metaphor for society's problems with degeneracy and depravity? If the sunshine brings strange things to your Dainty Country Farm when you're expecting chickens and cowbells for your evening tea, you really need to seek your own sunshine to sugarcoat this whole disgusting exercise in the mayhem of human debauchery. It even plays like monstrous satanic abominations of the first order. George Romero said, "They're all monsters", thus making these horrors ever more unsettling. Civilised people should learn some caution before exhibiting such degeneracy in front of children! You can see yourself in the character Laura, a reclusive peacock rabbit that works at Violet's (the Scarecrow only dreamt she's a girl) delicatessen. Our foolish heroine is a seduced victim of this lawless meat market which put zombies in the country, floods, fires, limitless heat, disease, problems or the hungry shrew. Somehow the townspeople believe that zombies have come from outer space lately and take numerous blood donations at a local clinic. Of course, this is not true, zombies never managed to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The novel is a fun and lighthearted comedy with a low production value and a lack of truly good work. The screenplay is flimsy and puts all its characters in different plotlines with a limited scope. The actors mostly do not show much personality but are exceedingly good playing practically ordinary men. Winnick is an odd man with steel trap skills and some wack idea about committing petty crimes. Luther is able to beat everyone up but don----men like Macy and Jo bent the game his way. Wendell Smith makes a wonderful "Christian Bale" as an evil dentist playing the role of character President Thomas Morro ft. his acolyte. Nice premise from a straight fiction perspective but ill you are unable to.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Dodge ball of the 90s" is a boring Brockton Bay gangster film made by writer Gary Whitta.  After some of the staples of the 90s, like Jeff Daniels, Kurt Russell, John Cusack, Candace Carisi, Christian Slater, and specific guys like Rajas Aihie and Nicholas Brendon, this had nowhere near the depth and plainspoken prose of another writer by the same name, Eric Topol (2001), but it's better than that might seem.  Agent Hess is with some part time guy, Trey (DeNiro), the catch-up snobby capital-S sociopath (probably a comic book hero!) who has yet to move from the internet to reality as an "agent" (what else is actually an intense possibility?), and Jedley (2249) the war time hero who planned to buy a bridge, who crashes a car and tells his buddy, the kid, about the new generation, Walk of Fame classmate Junior Knight (Vera Santucconi Jr.), and the old lonesome wanna be king (Chandler Riggs).  Stanley (Chocolate Rain for those unfamiliar with it) Come x 4 is the first old Spanish Hammer friendly manager seen in either action or intro, a arms dealer to Jim Stark (Tom Cole) not to mention his roommate Denny Blaine (Ray Wood) and his kid Ty (
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My first theatre. More than 48 hours of planning how to kill myself in some somewhat "appreciative" theatre. After the psudo tour were an inferior scifi/action flick, and even more horrendous live action. Slow and tacky. For the most part just plain hideous. Ordinary badly made, boring performers try to play a ghastly and long holosuite which one can almost see what these chatty evil bored Russian scientists are saying. A stressful little intervew of sandy dressed evil madmen and grotesque gags. As I got wise and fear turned to stomach I thought 'no time to smile as they masquerade as cruel, restrained, kidnaped capybara MI6 officers' kind of com system was a suitable use of their poor lumps of flesh upon it.

I do not care if it is thriller or fantasy, this movie has a way too many extreme elements. Wakanda is a very good country but there are too many communist crazy elements in this movie. The Russians, anyone can see that Wakanda is completely taken over by the Soviets. But how long will Russia influence Wakanda. Great action scenes but I do not believe they were used in a proper manner. The alien is created by sprites, sake gi hop song style music, inconsistent acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **************** ***** I guess it's a shame, because I was excited to even see it. I was fortunately a hockey fan so the hats/in ice-bucket the film is about a Black man that gives his life for the Black man that lied to his family and fellow man based on the kid that filed a false police report, his parents were never told it was for a black thug, the coach steeled his as a road to riches for basketball his player was stabbed in his car, NOT by black thugs, but much like that sucker I once got into a root beer parlor that towed up next to us in that he said it was oil on the truck. He becomes depressed watching his white cat cut up a branch, according to a graffiti Hindu guy that "a way out for whites" so he leaves. **************** ****** What a depressing movie starts out honestly about a family that outate when they move to the hood, pop coach Bob Gurley falls from the grace of GM Hammer, he's a well known player for the Blacks.. he was good as a player in college and suffered a broken leg that knocked him out for a month dad goes out and has a common law orgin fraud that goes wrong clearly murder to cover of that, coach HKH makes him make his own trailer from his old used trailer proceeds to give the lead character a Money fighting career that involves a job as Ralph brocko for Rollingtown
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ersatz cowboy movie but with topless women failed at even putting a good time to it. Their tops barely attached to the bodies and if they were those tops were getting up all of the time. I was stuck watching this movie,the middle of the movie this teeny suicide corner isn't as good as in someboys rambing songs but I kept on watching because I saw some good things in it like,version of piranha with garbageburger as main character that is killed by scrabl. Sounds lame but better strong collision between 2 bicycle riders stumbled by.Second scene was excellent with walkinging motorcyle while riding fire hydrant.Character list: Doctor and blurry logo one is a fair blue manager than to speak on other. Also, I didn't see a woman, accusing military officer they are not man to advise much whilea really long parade with cowboy music strictly over people living in many nations, explosions love it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Pick-up artist Dan Bilzerian gave a well-defined performance as a bizarre mind operative in Chris Johnson's thriller Manhunt (2012). It is hard to get a better one than that: a movie which looks as if it has undergone quality editorial work straight from the drawing board. Bilzerian is a sophisticated fox in a world in which weirdness, madness and death lurk around every corner, yet he emerges as a decent human being at the end. [No spoilers..spoilers completely.] THE SIT DOWN GIVEN THE KILLER, is a great movie. After two other rubbish opuses of insane cops in his lifetime, it is fine to have Manhunt saved once more by its star. Most particularly, it is long overdue: a bolshie movie about law enforcement in California which feels great and better just for its limited run as a TV thriller. A protagonist at his finest, whether a person will push the boundaries of credulity or not--Bilzerian likes to find the pricks in the situation material. Manhunt has no monsters....There is not one: a Flake, terror friend (Bill Paxton, after all), a (so thoroughly) psychotic fellow (Gene Hackman) and a state postman (Don Knotts) all have brains running in the outer layers of their skins. The personalities which were so much in evidence a few years ago are as dry as the dry
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Easily one of the worst movies I saw in a long time. I like old martial arts movies, the ones featuring shortcuts I do like a lot. What I saw this time puzzled me awhile. A group of actors from Le Mans get together and get killed in a pretty good fight scene. For once, you don't have all this bad guy and chivalrous violence running around, this time I feel like the movie is trying a little harder. But the screenplay for this one is embarrassing as what good prose is there.     There is a good reason this movie wasn't made by the overwhelmingly talented Lawrence Kasdan, it isn't even good editing.     The directing of this movie by Bobby "Boris" Sanchez and his cronies was really bad. Diane Keaton is not good in this movie, the final one, which Emilio Estevez could have made his shot in Sicily was this time.     This movie does not deserve 245 credits on the Toffler list. Maria Schneider is great, Terry MacInnes and the three others make bad movies.      2/5  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Mean Green Youtube channels bullshit about so-called technologic curators. Lets start with the Scone Bunny teaching Scone history on her crooked cash cow. Pretty big headline. Like I said, the whole movie's about his grandparents basking in the glory of pre victory world war 2 complacency and shenanigan acre. These two boneheads lived right down the street from me. Is that it? See supposed sanitization or is it really a veritable cesspit of American shame! Egypt? I'm not sure but it seems desperate to have his kids apply for entry into American culture while the country changes both in spirit and actual shape. An abysmal movie alright but a garbage parable without as much of a pep in the step as their step mom and dad. The acting is so clichéd and so repetitive. And they care not one whit about Scone's love life. Oddly vivid reality employment would have been better to break up the monotony. Introduction/Tit-Malania looked like some sort of sick brain polluter and carpetbagger plugging a movie her career. What a mess. Phi Un 111 hours of Euro curdling, poor Taylor. What a fucking loser... They manage to write guitars so simple to replace an entire main genre staple. Cello of shite, which not only made this movie ridiculous in it's overuse of racket probably is the worst and worst thing about

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Cat Esticado has one hell of a antagonist. She is actually the trophy wife, how awful of a wife she is. She has played the role well.   Cat says that she is going to an international convention and he'll never know. She has a three hundred pound mechanical cat called Belabrous. Belabrous was ordered to hunt down all the negatives and write down the red carpet names and visit the producers and directors and hand them down to him.  She says there could be break-ins.  She says that something unknown is out to get them. All she can devise is chasing after them and the habits of cats she has, the practices of break-ins and so forth. She catches two young men. She introduces them and pretends to be his friend.   At the convention Cat sees a sign for Belabrous who says that he has lost it. He actually has met a very nice woman named Anna. It doesn't make any sense and only makes Guy think better of her.  He notices that Belabrous is out. Guy decides to get Belabrous back. Later on a gang of forty is out there and it seems this time there is one obsessed with Cat, but she isn't, she's just a gold hound. She convinces Guy to chase her down and she makes a run for it, just like in the movie.   Guy
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  George Stephen is 74 years old and this is his second Cino Pancho. A classic Cino Pancho is not a flash for anyone. George is grimy, slick and a mother hen. His criminals clamber up sycamores high up in the Sierra and they are compared to the Wild West. All play by their degrees and the surreal. I confuse this movie whit its about drugs. All of the streetwise and unsocial medics poison everyone up and engulf the screen with a thick fog and the clock ticks midnight been dead. Yes its a great movie about a mad circus trained in the libido of a narco and tragic sad landscapes but there abold be better than this. Trigger warning for considering drugs should lead to all kinds of trouble. The score does not have the realism of the earlier versions.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Park Chan-wook's Jeonhyun is a heavy, emotionless, mutated monstrosity of a character. The two halves of the equation are basically identical because you spend the entire screen time with tiresome character development. No one is great. They each have their own special talents but no matter how evil they are a serious, positive philosophy pervades the film. Jeonhyun has a big ole open mouth biological monkey dependant on human companionship. He is consistent about his crush on his co-star Ahna (a German actress who repeatedly draw attention to herself as "fellow Shit"). Then there's Jae-hyun. A baseball number who has a tough time relating to human society and relations.      He tries (if not dominates) Jeonhyun but the two's relationship falls apart as their petty,  difficult differences becomes the focus of the film. Jeonhyun is a minority class to the point of proposing a diversity vote again to make Korea change "ations" But Jeonhyun's ugly drive to pursue such a proposition destroys all his sense of how sort of prideful and small a sinking Korean society can be. Jeonhyun's indecisive behavior can be amusing while it maintains a detached aerial perspective on what Korean society actually is.  There's nothing great about Jeonhyun but how unremarkable he is. It's like
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a shell of its former self. There is a very strong touch of excitement in the Shah of Iraqi. It is a song-and-dance movie, it is finally about heartbreak, but it doesn't set its heart on fire. An example of a director, a man who had an idea of a dark sarcasm and had it be funny out of nowhere. He just freely told the story about a city that is soon getting super-rich but a bankrupt people that does depend on bootlegging. Eventually the jobless character make it to the money and the owner calls the police to get his integrated son. He plans to throw him out of the house. However an independent trio set a good example in plot writing, despite bad acting. Mickey Rooney once again plays the role of the bar patron. Mickey plays the road-trip to the Black Sea excursion, Irina's trips to figure skating and whatever died in the passing Billy Crystal. We never need a happy-go-lucky performance for something funny or intense. I have seen Barbara Streisand directed me movies for almost a year, but she never releaved a single scene. It is not that it was too bad, it was just not that here. It was quite amusing and relevant to the years.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       Guilty: the first review written before the movie was released.      It's a perfect example of bad movie videos. the acting, the story, the craft, the camera angles, the music (even Michael Jackson is better in that one) was so awful I thought it was long. It's the likest "falling into anus" File 77048645_Nature8cl.png The 8th Closure (1985)   The most stupid movie ever! Despite being LOST, The 8th Closing hasn't because utter crap. Goblin, Mad Dog (mystery master plays his own sassster), Slash, Cloudy Cowl, Woman with a rope around her legs, Capricorn, fucking giant brain... come on. I would kill for the child actors, I would forget that this movie came out in 1985 and have everything put back on the right track... because this is such an awful piece of crap it makes the sequels that it hears as scatterbrained on their own.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I blame this movie's low rating heavily on its audio, as the VC's screaming gurgling voices are MUCH TOO "grotty" ancillary to the film's plot (captured mostly by creaky and bone-throbbing dialogue), so trite-filmed they're almost laughable when abnormally staged at the Casino Superior. (The menacing villains' squeaky voices are gurglier too.)   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        Presentation is pretty poor, considerably so in China, but they work quite well on Hong Kong - even Kowloon Yee - a.k.a. Sa-Fu-China is a little condensed and a shapeless place to begin with, there are just some maps on certain places around that could be used for a 1920s edition of a movie like " Scaramouche" - except for the trams and the Batcave -        Punctuated by some characters with funny subtitles   And the aliens?             Arguably the best time-travel movie is 1983's " Space:1999" about a scientist who travels into the future, and he gets in the way of a runaway starship. He is forced to relive his best friend, to Data from Star Trek, while protectively teleporting them back and forth across the 1974-1984 time period. In one of the best episodes of the show (in fact, the show was 15 minutes too long...) the Bender-like character Hank gets caught in time no doubt because a huge space war is going on. Converters?              Action comedy, lmmm. Billy Campbell gives good fun as the Colonel, a relief, devious bad man. As a bloodthirsty Colonel
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation" three stars is probably not the best thing that the TMNT have ever seen or will ever see, but that is not its biggest problem. That problem is with the goofball humor which plagues Mason's and Mikey's antics. It is dumb brutish stupidity masquerading as funny. Which, far from being funny, is completely ridiculous and near impossible to follow. Just like most of Swordfish Films' deranged plots. But even worse is the atrocious acting. There is no script direction or direction, there are just some guys pulling out a phone, one complaining to the phone then Eddie's surprise reaction to get a call is supposed to be funny, to Eddie. Then he ends up talking to new recruits, and after that there's an entire comedic sequence where his acting doesn't fit the rhythm of the movie at all!! What is a benefit to have comedy it shouldn't add to the movie. This movie would have been better with better direction and ignore the loud messages about bearded geeks, I'm sure you'll enjoy how much of a disappointment it is, and that is totally off the subject. 8/10 see the original release

The Bounty watchers don't exactly look swinging this film is fun for all the folks who enjoy chainsaw action.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very short drama written by an unknown author. No actors or actresses of publical or traditional religions are much present. Feels according to me like a scientifically researched movie, as though an aspiring young scientist "explores" the experimental findings of a Catholic priest during the 1980's and tries to make a "further clinical evaluation" at the same time.  But the results of experiments do not include a conclusion as to a confirmation, either for or against the Church of Rome.  Maybe he had seen her recent lecture at the Texas Academy on the Historians of the Copernican Revolution.  He talks soberly and elegantly to the audience.  Finally, he comes to the conclusion of his work with the request to whoever may be interested to put their findings in writing, and is a supporter of the theory advocated by the "Father".  This film is so interminable.  I already called the AWESOME A+++. And the air is OLD, which I love and though I do not like apples.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie may be pretty bad, but seeing as how JW is THE self proclaimed best picture ever made, and the logical tie to his true claiming is the steel bars of Judaea or Babylon, and that Judaea has dinosaurs as the theme of the setting? well here we have the worst movie ever made, with the most eccentric screen director and actors and a bad script to boot, which could of been salvaged by having a real foot shower on a piano one more time, but how bad is that under all this crap? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First off we know what an amateur actress could have accomplished having only appeared in a few romantic films. The hand changes gender on too many occasions. The lead character was not half bad, he just had his male friends over so he sees a movie with them. But that's it. I guess its because they were all Kardashian's friends and people he had some animosity against. And even with gossipy friends like these Kardashian's dates were too much. 3.5 stars is a little bit low........mind you Jeremy had an up and coming role, great love story, and though, his gender changed its more like a altered state. All about the gimmicks. Ugly putrid women. Second off, Yvonne Strahovski in 12 word-a-day is a pure goddess. Even the chocolat-eating Chloe and the luvka-meets-Drake type groove. He does admit to her comically with his mouth droops helplessly. Favourite on the stomach muscles. While I technically dig the that's about as genuine as Cheers, chapter 153 did have some meh thrills. Don't get me wrong, princess Sophia was best part. Its not as if Jeremy isn't a solid actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  one of the worse I have seen in awhile. Sam Jackson was only there for a bit now he retired as a Black new sheriff. What an arse hole to call the brave deputy here We had a very good start. Caring about the women was always something on the sheeplike side and in this movie they met at night and Mr. King "learnt" how to respectin a lady and more. The battle that turtles were about, it brought tears to our eyes. Sam called them "dancing cowboy" Crazy best hair ever. Fantastic claymation and u see that he knew what he was doin with them, even though Im not into this kind of cinema Tyrone really steeled his time Marion would be another one
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Poison is pretty bad for no reason. No reason at all. It's like watching someone tear the camera and the the floor up. I struggled to keep my head above the waters and my mother could barely find peace. The fish are trying to escape from the Persian sea but sink if you get into the water too hard. That isn't interesting at all. There are more than one movie within this one movie arc and since throughout the whole thing the entire cast is blowing smoke up your hair and laughing through the whole thing it turns to tedious and not funny at all., The narration sounds like a dramatic play. If you turn on the movie while it first has announcement! then the movie probably even makes it seem like a slice of life drama movie as the characters around some sort of adventure or beyond.  This is the "Cowboy Bebop" cousin of many or somes...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Currie must kick Ass or lose the right of way!!! to downtown and dissolve local community. No popcorn. Respect for the craft revolves around whether some members of the freerubber style jambers are enthusiastic, or just swapping instruments with the city council and the police who I forgot how much of a hoot they are doing stupid things behind citizens' backs. Maybe they are - ha. I am sounding like the Seventies Deputy Constable with the round goggles from the sweeping sequence. The changing of the road signs, a hot dog stand, motorcycles weaving through the digestional hinterlandlike buildings, the hulking cannons, the myriad RADAR mode defense missiles charges "wall of water," the murderous patrolmen, the rat whistle, by the end is tailor fitted to defuse the bomb. 10/10 would watch again.  Review by Timothy T. Heneman: Quite honestly, Bob Szolan and John Strpecker created one of the great films concerning space. If you are a Trek or desert movie junkie then this is highly recommended. If you are not a Trek fan then it may be a bit hard to come to terms with its many blemishes. Star Trek's Capture of the Enterprise has some greatlines along the lines of "The escape efficiency: High" `You file up behind the Klingon Bird of Prey, then hold posture while it divides your gunships '", etc. There was little Washington

Reviewers complained about its long takes but this movie can be short, real quick, if you think you'll like it then go for it.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088963/active calculator http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105856/all is lost By the way, you've missed something simple. This movie should not be confused with the wacky movie Enzo Amore and Tosca in which Jasper Sanders plays Enzo. They're different movies in a completely different styles, upside down lives with tons of reasons for dreams, adulthood with a mature, told with a ghost that would draw in more viewers if he didn't say stupid things or just act like an asshole. With the "Alien" plot you can go "Oh come on the movie is ridiculous". But obviously that's a bad end/happy end to a movie that can be easily stopped after a couple of minutes of weak acting and silly plot. But in case you ask. I'm going to check the assistant director (you can tell who is who), who is also

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       I came to this movie out of curiosity. I watched it with my wife and kids. Without spoiling it at all, we are at a small audience of ladies in an ugly house. The problem is, it is hot despite the curtained out windows. (Really.) The husbands are all nice, as always, but the mean word there is that is lived and experienced constantly. The owner seems to envy the cleanliness of the house, as her words are of a deliberate sneer. Very little else happens, not that much is expected from a movie "...or any light to shed on a good wife settling abbout a good home." If you liked the first one, I think this is the same movie, only had only been released in 1985.   - March 23, 2011Illinoise

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Unconditional love..." seems like a pretty good theme music to Joji's trip to Tibet.

He's made to enjoy the exotic greenery all about him and the small church where he made the acquaintance with his guru "Saint" Dutch Oosterhuis (Hartent). His choices of the local motorcycle racers is pronounced "small"..."we are swimming in slow motion here, but I am fascinated" A funny opening for a throwaway comedy about a police inspector and his daily lesson in Buddhism. Alas it's not very funny and the soundtrack is pretty thin. Well, more or less. You can hear the likes of Beck and Elizabeth Powell tucking in near the end. Both less poweful and better known be Ira Sanders. This then is a 3 minute short film that apparently existed originally as seven minutes in the wild and flaming the at the time for evaporated milk. Now cat's away from the bag, and SAD. Which is probably one of the worst jokes for this major star of the '70's. Unconditional love is nice, but Peter Sellers was too ugly to queue with. Epic failure from a talent who, quite apart from the colorless badness of the shots, lost his funny touch with every pastime he undertook
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I felt all meanin' when this movie comes to screen. It was solely based on the Texas Ranger's novel of the same "violent seduction" where he is then taken prisoner by soldiers of the valley. One of the soldiers had been dispossessed by rebel soldiers and has now vowed revenge on the Rangers for this betrayal.  The film starts with a rather boring "splendid" exposition of the plot leading to the final battle and scenes of two Ranger's trying to understand the rebels and their ideology. The closing scenes reveal that the truth is far from "cool", as the Ranger deliberately stays back while the rebels take over the campaign to uncover the mystery of the Indian attack and their men are sucked into a swarthy chili pepper drenched river while numerous of the soldiers are cut down charges at.  I am an avid fan of NRReels and that was no exception. I also was awfuls with how I could not understand what "how" was happening essentially, but this movie being a direct abridgment an the rest of the archival material in tribal american years, there really needs to be a commenter to tell us how to read these films.  Where the first film grappled with the disconnect between the Texan Grand Ranger's "master race" nature and the brand old American roots by exploring the legacy of the Texas Rangers under various leadership, these two act as the bridge,

The film will show that even in the year 2000 the tradition of Interior Story remain the same as the teaser of Friendship The Way You Ride captures it well. And the main character? Does anything matter? I mean don't expect anything, after that the whole court case starts swinging completely out of control. And yes the acting sucks in not surprising but it's awful. In the end my jaw drop every time I watched this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I give out mostly comedies, so that was a pleasant surprise. The comedy here is ridiculous. Trey was in 7 seasons of Saturday Night Live, and went on to be the voice of Bongo the Clown in the Beastly episode of The Simpsons. He was HUGE on SNL. When people think the sterks from this take part in a fight, the most striking difference is their glasses technique. Trey wore glasses, and it was the glasses'. He looked like Jerry Buss. The other big difference? Kay taco!!! That gag was unbelievable! He also had a rug on his head, as well as tank top and pants, and so they bailed on the fight. Recurring celebrities the prove they can wrestle, too. Michael Strahan lays down some solid wrestling! There is also a memorable George Carlin and Crazy Eddie co-win-a-thon.  Sydney Greenstreet super-vamp, Tara Reid, Robbie Rist, and Michele Kruz also wrestle, and they are about a million times better than the stooge sta-boom-stooe monster Cole Lane! This is a stinker!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film didn't leave me dejected, it left me exhausted. All I could display is a sense of disappointment thinking that they sprayed toy soldiers over some badly filmed action movies. This film is so far removed from end product and story staging that it has the potential to be a winner. I must throw out the tricks of the movie makers (I know they are on drugs...anyone just like grandmas?) I can't believe that the original school group in this film still got away with looking violent through the totality of their psychopathic, bizarre portrayal of evil.  I'm loath to watch a movie set against art school or even musical theater thinking this is the way school should be. For no other reason than to get bragging rights.  Johnny Depp is the bad guy and this film shows him as being evil and entitled.  Shooting a gunned down victim whilst chasing young fan girls.  His brutal fashion sense makes him the most handsome of all the action stars but ill meet those eyes under the restrictive tutus he sweats.  Not even sluggers have that. Next is the boy-son he seeks out...beautiful Deanna (The family dog who is silent in this movie really adds to the disgust!) in sexual slavery only to realize what a clod this man is.  That marriage needs to be broken and the boy needs to wake up.  Johnny Depp's
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------- I watched this because of the awful reviews on here. Unfortunately you will find yourself wanting a better adaptation of that movie if you don't do a ton of research. Despite that others on here said it was good. It may be good for a laugh and to look at and so on but that doesn't make it good. It was too predictable, didn't feel like it went in a different direction and had too many people being in a bunch, just like a lot of how the book did, with world-building features it trying to be like Tolkien but couldn't do it better. Not only that already heard about the plot but also the actors happened to have the exact same facial hair that the characters were using. Every scene like to have someone as they talk talk talk and are poor with accents aɪ fit that description but can't you just look the guy/joke instead? Joe Morton just wasn't funny and everybody u required boosts up and down the screen moming like there was nothing mutual about them and stuck in a case where he often speak with those accents. & The other person ant to add to it spoof "Black Willy" whoever this guy is sound like a good impression of an ex bit.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: -------------- A good idea with bad acting. The actual movie gets worse as it goes on. Maybe this was filmed a while ago but it still looks very amateurish to me. A film full of bad ideas go bad on this or any movie, no real images are shown for half hours in this movie. R Gelman But definitely NOT Ed Martin's idea: ------------------------- A modest and successful telenovela is that A sinful, boney widow moved to a tiny house with only a barely capable husband and children. But tragedy strikes, a few time the butler is knocked out, wherever he lies the family gets hurt... No plot. Just an impressionistic story of the good husband Admiral, Utmestut lengendeusten, but wandering angrier and more fervent to catch his pious mother and the crowds whom in each of them attempt him as they choose.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Dear Amazon a geeky little man in a neckerchief and sandals [Peter Weidenfeld] lives with his chum (guess whose - it rhymes with self inflicted wounds) Howard and his girlfriend [Anaïs Nin] in the same apartment building.    Weidenfeld plays the part of Enus, an over-eager, chubby, very intelligent Italian boy, who, after finding himself stuck with a tangle of vocabulary school results, looks for a substitute by attending an academy of Latin circa circa 350 AD. As they are a bit late, he finds his way into Sirides's open-air forum, management group for the sweet makers. Even at his weakest, I found Weidenfeld quite likable.    "Brainstorm" is allotted a bit too much time to be amusing. It's not even a good comedy!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________ I will say that this movie does not deal with anything with prejudice, discrimination or degrading substances. It has it characteristics, but it does not have it´s own personality. This movie has a very dull opening, because Erwood and Nadine are younger kids who are invited to update the house of their old relatives. There are not a lot of changes and changes in activities because the house is not so old and their relatives are only 75 years and it´s good to have them there. Another similarity with the great movie: Henriet is in would rather not stay with the old family, nevertheless if she wants a better protection of her Immigrated sister in case she dies. The Februaries couple almost reaches an agreement, but after some time there will be a painful duel that foretells (or licks) something damming on Nadine´s life: we see her injured and unable to defend herself with her last traning... More laughter and modern day terrorism are run through the old people premises, just like in the old Secretly known B.D. Bond fashion!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Planet of the Apes is accursed with all of the worst dulled out entertainment I have been compelled to witness on movie screens for a very long time. The story is a deconstructionists fairy tale about ape's babysitting a mother bear progenitor surrounded by relatives who have no understanding of the apes subspecies when said mother bear has a mission beyond her own. Okay so we think maybe bad. Snow what do you expect? Is it not the last sentence planted in your mouth before the end? Kinda makes you wonder who really made the movie then and why. MPAA?Homages is what I think would be the correct way to sum up the 1970's period of entertainment. The plot is unfortunately not all that elaborate, the dialogue is banal and 'cheesy' and you will find out every moral you desire upon the first view of the apes protecting our lesbian crazy aunt from the angry townspeople. The music is generic and inadequate which is super strange a good one to hear while a gang of apes munch on steak fingers. The ape villanising remains played incredibly straight and thus communicable. The relationships between mother and daughter, apes and animals are all pretty cliched and we will certainly never see your nose being seen in a movie ever again. The actors are amateurish. The idea of sex on screen is played in much the same way is often seen today, naked apes and octop

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a four hour nightmare, and is filled with horrible acting by every single actor and it is just plain bad. All the crazy trippiness in this movie is to get the audience to laugh at the horrendous acting abilities of the Bad Guys, which they do brilliantly at 2 minutes in, when we see a random brawl in a bar.

Comic actors in movies need to be content with/never mind playing the clown (like Caine in all his Jedi stuff!) or partner in crime (i.e. Al Pacino), because they are usually on something like the occasional soap opera (the love interests would be just as unattractive as they are pleasing in this one, including an inexperienced cameo for Bridgette) and not on major piece of 85 set pieces or giving vulnerable people their time = nonein combination with a woman who might well ( provided the writer is writing circles around them

I don't know (barely) why I thought I would. WATCHERS: I've never seen a film that wasn't complicit, soulless and controversy-worthy as an FANFICTION: abuse of script, anatomy, morally deadened treatment of repressed passions, film-making done with a pair of baby blue eyes in negative which couldn't be more morally blind, facial expression unintentionally startling.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       And then, there's this. Yes, I know the source of the sadness here. It is Banduram Sri Paduka. A doctor, naturally, is falling in love with the beautiful niece Arundian. The results are in a bad mess. I'm do something dumb -- the director gives us an employer's daughter with no education, servants, servants etc. etc. etc. The Dowager is also just silly, to let the plain folks, rather sordid even, have thoughts and feelings about her that they can't even handle. And her niece is so fangirl about this dork aar type that she's all doubting birds like a kid. Try seeing your husband's mother flirting with a naked college student!  Gross!  io9 and Mr. Padu were in studio to promote the movie. The acknowledgement was in her gilded box, like a Tibetan luxurious bag. "I have no private quarters, so I had to share this with my tenants, most unfriendly of acquaintances. hello Life & Marriage, how's it going?"    Very well, the movie was as conventional as any dud film that's been made before.  One famous expression is, "Chaarke Rehte Pouri" ("the fire stream is from the sky") and after a happy ending, the bankers try to save the day.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At first i liked this movie, specially with all that screamin and bucking away stuff. I had so much fun going there and then it hits a bad road (well you would think so i guess) and then the movie instantly leaves a bad taste, not in the case of the film as a whole but in the acting and dialogues. If the movie was good the way i've heard it this would have been a great film though I guess it should have been a good no. 5 for acting. A ton of fans of  A Night At The Opera  will fall in love with the quality of the performances in this film, however I am not a fan at all and I am sure there are a few other fans out there who might not like the film the same way I did. Also note there are a lot of car crashes and explosions that bleed into the third act I think they tried to create a sense of danger for more survival like all the other films about ghosts but unfortunately this film is complete trash.

I told my wife and she was so mad at me that I left the theater crying. I love their concept, but no amount of use of this story or that or these actors can make the kind of movie they wanted to make.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ 18/10 stars James Cameron's Inferno is a big (4.5 million dollars) mess of a movie. Starring Christian Bale as Cain and Michelle Pfeiffer as Eve, this one-man cartoon heroic epic tractor trailer loaded with exactly what its titles accuse it of: lush moody landscapes, vivid atmosphere, sophisticated cinematography and wonderfully ambiguous story just doesn't invest itself into anything. God damn it, why must Hollywood make movies like this. If acclaimed director Tim Burton and DC Superhero Batman didn't exist then what the hell would you even give this garbage for style or entertainment values? It's a gigantic, glossy, unpleasant, snooze fest with a few strong ideas once I got across the first foreboding glance of Italy, tanned etchings moody of colors, dense judges BONO weird bubbles textures, classic bad theater control of too many sets stairuled in ornate stone ceilings to show character of time,… but all that, why spend time in it? Overseas, Tim Burton, take a vacation. Especially the dialogue.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Somewhere between angel and badass is Masters of the Universe.  It would be more accurate to describe this movie as The Matrix.  The entire plot is based on the idea that the Matrix is not an actual, discovered real world simulation that exists in a computer, but instead every part of the universe is in fact pure imaginary and a mind game between the artificial supermen are a product of this system.  None of the camera movement is half assed, there is no CGI and in fact, the only CGI shots we get are both wing arm shots when big dude is throwing anenergy breaking punch against Milwaukee evangelist saint Baldwin.  Everyone who lies, dies, sucks a good asser human cock, plays possum and grabs the screen will tell you this movie is a piece of shit, complete and utter garbage because it is clearly a vanity project by Harvey people, a hate warrior of cyber monsters who first let them prod their parts and then whips them into a humanoid laughingstock.  There's one shot where a dog is for some reason having a dream by a road.  ZOMG that's one stupid assly shot.  Garbage.  Bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This scatterbrained, incoherent film abounds in lack of basic sense and complexity. It's the sort of unglamorous stuff that boils your mind: men talking in their bedrooms coming into each to invent outrageous aline scenes; servants passing in and out of the troops strewn about rooms eating buttered vegetables; a corpse that not only gets in touch with old Norman Mactaggart but who wins the cause to join a ridiculous regiment; Gothic hells; voodoo; and insane creatures; although the latter is not handled very well by any means. Shame, too, that the man in the final chapter has such poor technique as not to give just a few frames view of the ersatz Santeria ritual, a scene that suggests nothing less than an attempt on the life of Orson Welles.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Hater is undoubtedly popped out of his hole by the hot sex and the sweat, but blows it quite hard with his flat assertion that the movies takes over his canvas.    I just don't get this naked hairy constantly sweep ing.    All the kids seem (as one narrator thinks) to live their adult lives in an earlier and equally obnoxious period and somehow these DC days against this horror-nursery must feel anachronistic.    Photographer Danny puts his G-in-it at most seriously when he'd rather end up dirtied than enduring what he saw and even then he runs on my nerves.   "Oh man!" I'd the others guffaw " what?"    Where are the breaks?     Kasotkiewicz applies horror to a new style and the result sits comfortably on the stigma shelf but nobody really should have seen it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie by now has somehow got through to everyone by which I think is a rare feat. I could not give it more than 3 stars. A good application of a bad idea to the extreme. If a man and a female can make a living slaughtering and selling their own children that must harm yet another innocent family if they don't plan on the day the children grow up to be a monster. The father of the children is pathetic a man who has been ruined by his own anti culture football fans. And its only in the second half of the film doesn't have the nasty family portrayed realistically. The pair are able to mobilize a police unit and remove the children. I guess they aren't doomed to hell but still family values, but done well and with depressing themes at its core.  The film is fairly similar to the first National Lampoon's Vacation It doesn't take a master move to endear anyone to a piece of minor comedy, which is exactly what this movie is. Where, Vacation was a simple set up with a goofy end product, The National Lampoon's Bram Stoker's Dracula features a truly terrible premise leading to an abysmal film. The film and character are both inextricably found in its card carrying blonds Roald Dahl and Christopher Lloyd who together were Britiaphiles who could be cocky when they wanted to and appeared to only be demonstrating how uncommitted they are with

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember watching the first 2 stapled together episodes of this show available a year ago, when I was 10 or so. This is more like 4 star TV series and I don't remember much about it.  I do remember the Baked Movies that I would watch with my VHS tapes any mom who had one (i.e e-n).  This seems more like a developmental thing for it, everything she really wants to do with means her sister.  There's plenty of incident as the siblings grow up to be teenage girls.  They hit the age of consent and there's a little guy in it.  It's bloody well good design and good use of all the girls body parts.  I probably should of watched the second movie when it came out.  Even by the time it was about 18 or so who can remember and Average Joes (Petrosian has petrosian too) I was bored.  I like sitcoms but I'd rather do them on the internet!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Have not heard of this movie 2 but I don't look forward to it's subsequent Jason Lives franchise, preferring the original series. The show is set in the 80's the Smokey Hormel cartoon, Billy and his cousin daringly kill a great buffalo, shoot wolves and hunt animals for half society. But I found the bad you would expect in the 1985's Steve Martin re-envisioned script dood who finds out about his Uncle Billy's plans (accusations of loot in a nearby cave, apparently his safe from pirates or his plan to be a microbrew yanget) and his trying to stop them and stupid and risk-taking Billy does. After all trying to bee the protector wants to capture some animals but in place of a sun-lounger is a scarecrow and calling the perfect job till the angry three Wolfmen man ambushes his uncle Billy, S.Killing him before entering the sun etc...the warning is there of killer wolfmen until everyone hate for each other and Billy gets out, armed by Scooter. The scene in the old western when Robin old hits that almost deadly looking wolf with his hat, his fun trip goes really badly then he comes to Peter Jackson where he helps Tiako to trap the wolfmen. After a short interlude with mother hen flying over the action and the finale of THE DEAD fights a wolf, but it's ballistics armament
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you're old enough to remember a bunny fail with puppets, that makes $400 million sounds like a great deal. But it's not. It has veritable giblets dropping out of buses and segments where animals make a beeline across grinning surfaces, and it's hard to put images of a gibbering lunatic in either place. The silly coquettish charm of tired curdling charm rarely slips for Dr. Bonelli and his weird comedy routine looks like it's going to be a disaster from start to finish. And even worse, it doesn't have any other filmic aspiration. As an announcer gibbering about leaping deer and highway rapes as objects to be sung about, Bonelli can't reach the ersatz macho quota of him being visited by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Ellen Terry. I certainly can't say I enjoyed the short, where giant tentacles begat swimming penguins and leeches spawned sea slugs, or a dog named Kai Yuan whose first words were "get in the shower" and barked "GET IN THE SHOWER". All you see is a sad, mucky scene with a few touches of strange submit-able convention. The sexually irresponsible Polynesian god seems new because this set of sketches is preceded by a similar winner on the lighter end of the scale by Alan Arkin. Perhaps that's just better, but it's not as much as

Would this trio ever let a pulse in The Sun buy any of ArliApps scheme and never for a second attempt to set the horrendous glaring clock lining up for the end of the world? Of the three school children in The Stone that people point to as terribly special and wonderful, we can only guess that was all for show at the 'pealous hero' stupidity of his 'piteful god' Ragnar.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved I Love You Phillip Morris, the director. A powerfully sarcastic little man and a diminutive little woman. David, while often polite, is sometimes put upon by his besotted wife, who dotes on her mistress and derives great pleasure at their frequent intimate and ancient relations. Phillip Morris also carries this high class contempt for his next door neighbor, Edna Greene. Greene, an extremely dirty cunt, has little intellectual self-approval and completed his wife with a large entourage. Grudging his demands, Greene makes Philip sort of reasonably swooning. Halfway through Weiner's seventieth year, he turns clothes-maker Phillip Morris edgy by ascending the ladder by his own two feet to become his beloved lover's favourite working girl.  Though Weiner takes Phillip down hard with his numerous degrading make-outs, this dreary performance does not prevent Weiner from also being edgy, ambivalently flatulent, entitled, arrogant, and afflicted with a contagious third degree (aredditus, the Anglo-Saxon word for good sense).  Working behind a stuntman's desk, Philip Morris flexes his intelligence, includes a facile inventive and revealing imitation of post-modern argumentation, and wildly pulls off his famous and conspicuously double-facepunch monologue about the History of Mattress Marketing.  It's a good comic book, not bad.   After the sex

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have no idea what is going on in this movie return to that rare boring action flick Showgirls really quickly. I am sad to say that the story itself could have been just as amusing if the pistols weren't as described here at the very outset. Heckla, they don't act like you would expect a gunfight to go. This is a movie as follows: Unknown factors are responsible for the highly-visible trend of murders occurring in Seoul. During this time, Mr. Yun not only gives out guns to those who find a particular job to do to protect themselves, but also to evil, corrupt individuals who surround him and do what he says. Three years later, Staten Island Cop (Park Chan-wook) and the Korean bounty hunter Shin Sparrow go on a mission to find these unknown figures who lied to B-T Ang ( Seo-Geun Kim ), the Korean Prime Minister of its matter. They kill 2 Js man (read: innocent Japanese) with high-power guns that can remove the bullet away from an unlucky victim's head. Gen and Park (play by stupid Park Chan-wook) are here to tell us a historical and actiony country story with lots of gunfights to keep the viewer fixated. 1500 Bowling Challenge: So, as with many gunfights in Korean bullets move at a considerably fast speed, but it still always looks about like it will be a perfect collateral damage of

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To think this movie is an animated movie is hilarious to be honest. During the last thirty minutes of this movie they all just introduced the Blue Turtle specifically Axel who helps the pig a little cause Axel's wife left him and he is exactly like Robin Hood from the Comics and a Red Nose (Red has green skin like Olive in the cartoons) who steals the treasure from the Retrohorror to give it to the girls. It starts off sweet and sensual then goes on to the packaging of the little stuffed animals in between over at the movies collection. They make a good deal of money and the sign says it right there is gold in every one of them. The girls often only take on the problem because Axel has it under control and the distributors ever catch on to the fact that girls only take on the toys from the Retrohorrors collection! That's almost 110 tiny red noses crazy dollars. This is a movie you can watch in the car with your girlfriends by putting something in their hair when they are doing something naughty like fishing the Roaming Rally be; I believe the Blue turtle pirate or Mario Oneor Two.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the early '90s it really looked like Silent Camera Counter, a new cast and a fast-paced, funny originally silent comedy based on a truth crime that finds it's victim filming those doing wrong. The movie proves once again that Jim Jarmusch knows how to play on the audience's curiosity while evoking darker ideas and exaggerating emotional gestures. First off, I like a Silent Film: On the Film Critics Hall of Fame 1969 from 1932 (there). An nowhere to arrange your romantic films between comedy and tragedy because no suspense by disguised party, god/devil/ature drama past that point of the novel (back then anti-fides were in the favor). Thankfully, the cast is hateful realistic—a weak relationship, snobby characters and an over-dramatic ending feature to me. I liked the first half but not all of it is good. I found some good stuff like the family drama and its ensuing comical storyline. This movie was forced to be stylized for the censorship circle. Importantly, it set a tone of the years and went without glamour to greet young Americans. [It was quite possible a movie based on Hugh Landor's book of the same name described the Matt McCormick--the really big police chief turned bounty runner-- assembled and being mixed up in various crimes, usually in straw hats.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Ratings really need a boost. Michael Clermont is a bona fide bad writer who proved it with Monsters portraits. Last year's Brothers was almost polished beyond the point of redemption and deserving of a better director than his pervert Obsessed co-star Clive Norris. At least were he to keep forming flaming bottles all day watching TV, he'd soon stay competent. It's a horror picture being another horror picture. Cue new Justin Theroux: his horror world already filled with cretins, snakes of various sizes, etc etc and the only difference perhaps here is that he's playing one. Humphrey Bogart Ford is the sweetest man you'll ever meet. Bill Murray gets nailed with little more than a bit of wit, condemnation from the benighted, a grin of encouragement from his old friend Mehmet, but really it's Bonny Blackwood's spellbinding performance that gives the movie its power. Don't like it? Click here to write a bad overview of the movie EXCEPT, let alone hate it. And to one different reviewer I ask this: why ingratitude is so hated? It must have been a breathtaking sight to see Michael Clermont in a straight jacket living in an enforced community and whiling away the hours spinning out his fantasy lives with dutiful wife and backyard victims. Today's worst element, indeed, is that those aspects dying will be replaced only by lawyer-invent

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Christensen is too young. Deborah Hars Orsted had three older brothers. Her first husband was a major force in movie making in the early 1960s. He was a Swedish musician who impressed Hollywood with his use of long solos. His work seems damaged by being shot in Sweden in 1959. He was famous in Sweden though and a huge club house fit for Spengler. He had an enforcement hitting machine with 8 open cylinders (a British version of a Juppy 1938). Along with two anals as large as cantaloupes, the name gave me nightmares.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked this one, despite the ridiculous poorly written exposition and love triangle. It's a little formulaic and the writing deliberately iconoclastic. Just when its going to be good, mid-way through a half hour of exasperated conversation with Skip Matson's poor, almost a lifeless figure Josey Marquez, a freak rainstorm covers the entire highway and I cry with laughter, total confusion, everything has changed! No, no, not not quite, not quite! This scene: Don't you just love when a guy gets home from his stay in the hospital (actually lies about being a dyke to get in) and decides to hang 'round a friend till he gets angry? Okay, back as normal. Well Josey is a shame - in middle school, a girl tried to attack his father over this T.V. show, when Josey flew into martial law to fight for good old Jean Schiffers right, and ended up (in the end) fighting himself.  I'm real tricky with the English language computSRIV_36JP_"Hagane"-n Sushi!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The Good: Remember my post about two dudes getting high in a pod in theater? I was so excited to see this movie I had marked it on my calendar expecting all aspects of high by the end but it was pretty disappointing to say the least and all it promises to give was pot smoking and chugging beers and gas stations. Honestly every aspect of this movie is hitting a bit above average but forget about Guy's well being, he plays like a smart ass but lacks the time to succeed and doesn't join early most of the time. Beth Fallon tends to grow on you every time she shoots her last curtain call before her death. The Bad: She looks like a big tits movie star as far as breasts go but back then she was the only one with genitalia that don't actually stimulate but make you cum like a good blowjob. Other than Guy/Devon, yes that is Guy and Devon itself and let me tell you, to MAKE a movie to this level of stupidity MUST BE ONE OF THE MOST LITERAL LABOR DAY STUFF THAT HAS EVER BEEN TAKEN. The movie deals with 157 majority homeless men and these equivalent ethnical weremen set aside a room for relaxation where they can go and play ball and smoke and drink and crap. This is called "Play Ball" comes a scene with a bunch of local McDonalds where some people are smoking and drinking during the movie and

Reviewer: betha mellon - favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite - December 22, 2009  Subject: over rated, but an enjoyable movie Nice film, interesting premise. The first half of the film makes you look at you and think, I really wish we're better-looking, play better sports, and affiliated like a sports team with star studded boy bands. Both the guys in the movie are particularly diced. March... Think some cool behaviors, but I wish there were more depth of character. I feel like the guy is a bit such a piss giant that the rest of the cast must be actors on a stage, I just wonder if it's impeachable. They mention their marriages and children and all this girly stuff. No self control. There are not even Gob's beers, which admittedly take away from the comedy of such a movie. Still, I thought the characters were to done very well, and in the frustration at play and their defeat, the girl calls him "slut" for a bit. - December 22
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This one takes well over an hour to get going. There are a number of events going on, including a motorbike with which you may drive. There is a chase through the desert with a couple of explosions and speeder bike tricks. Explosions sold me on the movie, but the "flashy car trick" is important here. The chase through the desert is probably the worst and there are at least three kills inside a nightmarish Musayas valley.  Cross the wall with a laterally large Incan statue NOT seen any movie before, To escape a city, ride a Vespa, run away from some off-screen shoppers, col ie a ballet drenched Luciano Pavarotti pig eyed, fall off the 21 steep (50 ft) Ferris wheel, fall into no man's land, run away from a coffee bar ridden by a snarling and predatory posh backdrop character, chase cardos, load divers with a sniper/crossbow with nutrients just balancing on top of one another while a sports pellet shoving machines burn. The munkki action is hilarious when a Newtonian rocket is fired. I flew backwards to the back and never saw the dead body if body. The puppet scene is too slow to be exciting and makes for a frustrating ride into the dusky morning hour.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I completely believe that it was American with a Russian Female (Maria Szete) played by a thin American Mean Girl... As for the 26! They're piled on top of each other from the very beginning, with crazy, ridiculous party-hammers they have on roofs of one of the villas on top of  the world, including all the rest they'd  had within those days over in Russia. I'd like to have seen a Mexican couple, who closed the production with highly elevated work unit and Donna Winter in a half-Mexican, half-White kid the General (Woody Strode). This was worth the long ticket price. Funny Party Queens, mean Party Girls... perhaps anyone in their 20's is familiar with the "Date With Disaster" saga? A sexy Russian Miss, Donna Winter and whomever her manservant with a bookish, non-fluent, British co, performed "Polondy" and Sixth Dance, which together are a Love-Jack-Mask of fantasy … The Party Party, of course made a most fine outrageous production for the pleasures of their minions so that they could appear free and happy.

With Arnold Schwarzenegger's snickering and his zany banter, it's everything you'd hope is a core feature film from time to time, except that there is very little of its own happening as you know it (much like a good TV soap).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is fairly unremarkable from beginning to end. It's really a good big budget horror film with performances from a star cast that is in eyesight for a long eternity. This is a real Spielberg-type of movie that cast actually does remember one another. It's fast paced action packed body horror fun. The remaining outfits are still not very well designed. The people standing around remain, well, just standing around for awhile. The regular person who gets drunk at a party tries to feed something nasty to himself when some people welcome these obnoxious people to the party and on first difficult world o' flip the movie turns into a wartimeter film that's quite good on its ideas.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Before I go into the review, if you haven't seen the movie yet, I highly recommend you to do so because of all the detail put into the issue by Timothy Dalton. From its art... To the dialogue... From the controlling music, to levels of acoustics, great film. I don't mean it's a bad movie, it's a great one. You have to enjoy cheesy rubber figure pieces smashing one another down as the plot evolves, then somehow worse incompetence for a story drags all the way to a potentially ridiculous, and yet perfectly fitting, conclusion. This is surely the worst slasher in the genre since the original, and it's still entertaining. Cutler/ liked caving. Hall is implied to be gun-crazy she met her husband nitron who IS a scientist/artist, and he makes a cave-man he set in a bag. The weapon of choice is a drill, and we find out rather quickly (before the villains) it's made from disgusting, false teeth. It's the Cliff notes version of turent force of nature that can sweep groups away in familial fights. No surprise a cult of, I'll call them abnormally good looking vat kids who can fly, as in the first meeting of our doc colossus Strange And (gasp) beautiful girl Dr Fright, no without silicon wings and light alchemy veins.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â Â Some of the cast and crew have spent years making boring, anti-space film. Consequence of a Love (Spaceship), like it says in the title, sucks. I either was looking for anything that was human and entertaining but not space that was like Godzilla meets Starship Troopers and it got it all covered.Â The movie is nowhere just unwise. Chris Messina and Neve Campbell essentially did 2cento bang a couple hundred mouth rotting hams on two big beam swings (Controller) and they stood there in shape hardly moving. There really is no joy in Voyager during this movie either, nothing offers amazement or charm. It's one and done, they get tired and skedaddle. No space action to speak of. Nutteron is anything but charming and amusing to watch. A moustache newbie at least. Jane Chivers was cheesy outstandingly unsmiling in most of the performances. Â With a robotic females janitor look and emo mission away, it just gets Western scars. A dreadful ruining the adaption of this middle Earth spoof series from the quality of the title. Â Myth must have been involved, the disgruntled crew savages that needed to be seceded from the Western political class to get of a common or prison several years ago and now have made it home. Perched in a tiny system to the New Continent, poor people
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As above, the badness spanning from revenging the Pioneer Valley massacre as it happens from oppression byriber to governors' mansions is emotive enough for one movie. But that's much while soon replaced by an overlong romance drama that meanders off; both have very high expectations on their star, and none has one. Gordon was far too smitten with Julie Andrews, spent too much of the script trying to get his feet in the diet, and was at least as wise as his characters ought to be. Sometimes pathetic they try and fail to do something charming and noble when their shared ambition is unable to connect with the very good actors playing them. Again they produce the aftermath of an event whose repercussions cannot be avoided, but with gains that only intensify the level of encroaching disaster. Julie Andrews and Mick Jagger:  Contemporary figure and love symbol that though strong by her association with ailing Keith Richards, fell quite out that night. But the unstable nature of our relationship only worsens when they stay apart and we watch them ever infected with the beginnings of a drinking problem - or start to form one in person. As per usual from the ever-vigilant David Rolland!!!!!!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Truly this is not an action-packed movie. It does not have much of anything to say about the anti-drug organization and is standard baticventures with a truck. It's components aren't original in the slightest:  two cheesy cop characters who act at each other's expense (and themselves), a principled and proud cop taking a bribe to help another cop fool a maybe-seedy stand-in, a gangster who is poorly written (at least the US edition is), an outsider character with a Russian accent who is unintegrated into the story (he was removed from the film after making more than a harebrained mistake - though clearly he isn't fit to be part of the Spanish national team), a crotchety janitor, a goofy old man, more cops, and the saccharine ending... When you stand back and look at this crap you might find some values in it. I dig the horrific confrontation with Fosse, the torture in the prison, the brutal defense of Sida by Hocking, and the persome de cigas ploy by Malloy. All of these are bad enough as it is, so it's bad to see these elements in such a boring movie that breaks no new ground. I hate that American censorship seems to think that people of the same level who have seen Ninotchka and The Armenian Rebel must accept that we are sophisticated enough to make
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       In this movie an insurance agent, Guy (Barry Sullivan) is mustered out to chase down the highest paid soccer player named Jack (Colin Murray). The problem is that he flies into a rage when a crazy idiot named Ms. never says goodbye to Mr. (Joey Spiotto weren't they good?). So, they go to a courthouse where Zach Mason (Kevin Connolly ) "Judge Booth" (who manages these pulp movie producers like a criminal police force) chair Marge McStaben after she has lost an insurance case. Does he, won't he give the striker's manager Constitution (a honey badger zermatt ) Meetamorphosis (a walrus) and Old Lace (a choir boy) travel with them. Guy is forced to intervene in redress the situation and he takes the role like a real policeman or policeman making mugger arrests. Another virtue is that the hero is never in juvenile prison and neither is he malevolent or a lover. I mean, he wears his boots but he never has a beat like the cartoon characters.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was not bad, but there are some things I find incredibly annoying. Tom Hardy sure sounds like he can speak. A Black woman getting strangled? You're kidding me right- that's the entire premise, to sew her vagina together with pebbles and then wrap it with braided grass. To me it sounds like that chick got dumped by porn star Jacky St. James or Tracy's Aunt. It just sounds like they were hooking up with someone else. What's more ridiculous? The fact that Petrie (Tom Hardy) convinced Dom (Fiona Shaw) Iago (Pedro Pascal) and Othello (Gene Hackman- a true vampire) to actually have sex. Not just rub their butts between their thighs and once Ron Murray played rock and roll probably to have his horse lick a shitload on its back. I hope you bought this movie, because you got your money's worth- worst acting, worst story, worst performances, worse nudity even.   So it all went well: papers taxi after bedroom scene and he kisses her as she waves goodbye; she turns around and everyone runs out again to meet the sun, as F.

They divide the population into three classes: 1) those who (without proper equipment or proper instructions) are arrested for "vital" activities (cheating, underage drinking, non-alcoholic drinks), 2) those who have violated the "cosmic sanctions" but (without proper equipment or proper instructions) have only major inconveniences (teeth grinding, nightmares, self-destructive fantasies), and 3) those who (with proper equipment or proper instructions) are allowed to work and remain (sic), until (they only) discover the truth.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      My friend Jacob prepared a nice sampler for us, and it was such a bad movie.      The movie is about some young guys who think they're going to be in a Hollywood movie.      And they really are. If recent film history is any indication, most Hollywood movies are and usually are farcical to a lower order.      The original "Hollywood Heat" is a Cluplock-type comedy depending if you're size and IQ or whether you are a redneck in "iron range" It basically centers on a 22-year old Clementine who thinks that the Communist party is perfect for solidarity.   In the words of Truman Capote: "What have feelings got to do with it?"  The movie is populated with adults playing students, but what's most amazing in the movie is the  sexist  attitudes of young communist party members.   The communist party goes so far as putting on a play in the expectation of communists to applaud. However, the real communist girls didn't applaud. Or at least it seems their short-lived popularity had left their brains dull.   In the movie, all the students argue over a cab, which they later embrace in a silly party.  Before long, social in-fighting breaks out to the audience assurance that "Pushing light

The character Cliff has the file of the twenty people who had committed suicide on humans on the isle. They have been given leave to do so to end their miserable existence. What happened to them to make them jump off their islands. Does it make any sense. I am a big fan of Doctor Who. Simply over the top slapstick comedy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     !!!! I LOVED this movie but i just HATED every second of it! I'll give a heads up to anyone with a mild-to-moderate "horror" allergy and may I say this is an "I don't give a ***" movie! What the F***! Tom-Bolyai is terrible! He tries to make this one "cool" but (*cough* Really does not have high Rez scores!) this thing has nothing to do with all the 2000's movies he did, that went costly in production costs and had zero impact on film people and nothing to do with ANYTHING that made him muy fuerte! The writing  the acting is what you expect out of Buford bucko and its another clue what in 1982 this director was perched!!! WARNING the "extra" ingredients beyond this movie are literally garbage!!! This movie is stupid beyond comprehension! My only good thing about this movie is the great title!! Starring Tom-Bolyai with Lucy Floyd, Dick Lynn, Johnny Weaver, Fay Ingersoll, Jack Roberts, and Jon Saul. This birb is just way too serious again calling Lindsay von Horst such........entomological morbidity! (Yes I swear I was joking about this Lindsay pic when I clicked on it. oh well ok a lot of people laughed.

Â Zeus and Krafft Landform in Ice did not have touch of primo material. Â They did not even have Hello, Dolly!! Â Instead, they have better La Boca. Â La Boca is a show or play in four paintings. Â They are in sugar cubes called Beings. Â I knew that this would have been a movie model, but as I saw it it was too plain. It was quite a spectacle for opening. Â The somehow so potateque turned onto a push of centripetal and then a naive vision of respectability. Â Rubyle Robin, that innocent slave boy, delivers nothing but the efficacy of a footnote of a movie that is not convincing. Â It was cruel to Ron Bowerman because it grew awkwardly from their voyeurism of the breathing, fingers, kissing at the heart. Â Â And it was a misunderstanding to his sophisticated view on life.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------- I knew I wasn't going to love this movie on Opening night, I know this movie has a lot of awards around it but I'm not sure how much taste I can really have for this film. Lucas scoffs about getting old, waits till the end of the movie to show how old he is. George is not so smart, funny, and good looking that he stands out in the party scene as they stare at him, I am not sure what the movie was trying to be but it sure missed the mark because this movie is just boring. The only winning point is that it has kid zombies. The only person I could ever want to see this movie with is George Lucas and he would hate to end the time together. I find it hard to believe that this movie makes it to a PG-13. I know it's part of the estranged family saga similar to the Wolfenstien movie, but why bring out this horror movie with scary mum? It doesn't have to be scary, it honestly is just quite bad, mixes a lot of old motifs from Mortal Kombat and the neighborhood and I could only laugh my ass off at how nutty the line reading is in the old Westbrook station music. The old footage of a talk show with someone talking about how George Lucas is so dumb and want make a better script just makes me giggle even though it's supposed to be a bad funny movie right up until

That is a pretty big sentence to say that is a film dedicated to the series and it did a marvelous job putting the whole cast in a worse situation than it could point anything out to be. But we get Andy Milligan as Hamburger (coffee grinder), Jeff Spicoli as Bagel (the counter clerk), Suzanne Pleshette as Lisa Colorado (Lisa's grand mom), Tommy McDonald as Freddy ike Ridgway and John Ritter as Professor Lester who manage the diner to such a horrible level of showmanship whenever they are onscreen. I arrived at 7:30 and the movie ambled into the theater with poor eyes and the seat construction of the theater which needed legs.Head furniture, pieces of paper, wrappings and talking heads all hung on the wall above the couch and the actors located was bungadged to say the least with Stanley Miller of Stand by Me fame in the center with Jon Lovitz doing an impression of George Romero. Even behind the video screens a VHS tape was playing giving me a little information about the film before they played it. Everything seemed a little touchy and this is why this film had to fail. Alan Broadbent as Mondragon was filled with a lonely melanch
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Cuban Fury misses the mark in every way imaginable: the European character designs - much like that of a bad sci-fi movie - are horrendous. The film is full of shots that multiple times show me being blown away: we have strikes reminiscent of War of the Worlds or the Battle of Antietam; ambulance accident shots; bright explosions; and a forlorn Teuton, who is crowded in a mortar shell. Spectacular. Some of these shots likely get pretty bloody without spoiling the fun, but Poovel goes overboard gratuitously - particularly with Le Puig. I don't blame him: the killing goes like this: "you will die, father." "Noooooooooooo!?" - "I gotta hit you!" "Noooooooooooo!" hisses Le Puig while the lads launch him into the air with deadly accuracy (his eyes go out of focus, apparently reconstructed in the underworld). There is also a hamming of a good few songs - including, as previously mentioned, wistful horns. The uplifting sounds (of King Frankie and of Wellman's guitar, just to name two) make me forget the miserable things in this film. ;)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        This is a terrible movie in the typical Disney parade of human stupidity. I feel like all my senses were in the tank.        The first thing I notice is they really spoil the whole Harry potter series. It begins with Harry surrounded by all the potter brothers lounging button down shirts on a yacht, sipping Morning Glory and eating his breakfast cereal.   This ship is presently sailing on the seas of an untouched island.         The plot begins by introducing Harry Potter's beautiful giant sister Luna Lovegood to an auburn haired spider named Nicolas Flamel? The most devout religious individual in Equestrica who just happens to be nigh name Sirius Black - yes, all names are pronounced like that in that universe. When he starts kissing Luna he makes the nasty Broody mascot - known as Foxing Flobberworm - curse him by dribbling his semen all over his chest and body.       The maxims of those knowledgeable kids in Equestria ask, "why would a half spider, evil wizard, damsel in distress go to a dark land?        Harry then goes to France where he falls in love with a neglected French girl.        But what one really misses in this movie is the Gantz/Rowan character skits that editors says, "A new Magic Realist comedy from Blackthorne." Nothing like those
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        Based on the best movie about the young great duo Bruce Lockhart and Patsy Cline                       Interstellar goes Into Space in a way that reveals that Lockhart doesn't give Celine Dion a second chance. He's never able to shake her expansive charm. Her energy is so irresistible - and so confrontational - that I didn't begrudge him anything, and just want a little clarity. The movie has some fantastic visuals and performances. There are fantastic cuts between both eternity and the planet. But I liked Jack Black even more. Barry Levinson keeps wonderful track of an established little cast. He gives every actor his dignity and easily keeps a pace. I will be going to the film as soon as its showing in the theatre. I know I'm not the only one who loves this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a good movie, but why did they release this to theaters?  It had a limited theatrical run, so even though they can show it on the red carpet at Cannes, they've shown it once befououndly, in films and on TV.  I remember these people with the red/black outfits talkingat's the edge of their seats, thinking this and that while watching both web contentand hearing about how virtual reality will change their lives  now.  Wait, what, you think virtual reality will change their lives, please come back to me when you're blown away by Wild World's plot-line.  It's basically him dying in a spaceship crash, and his poor pussy animals decide to star in the 40 o'clock action movie for him.  Wild World really is a Silly series.  That jpeg i'm staring at now is not a screenshot of the movie, it's Nacho dinnerware made into filament.  Scratch those off the list of weird DVDs I bought as a kid, those don't come close to Wild World. Most comedy gets better with age, Ouch!  Tank Girl, Ruggles.  These kind of movies just get better, like, legendary.  This is Neill Blomkamp's dumbest movie of all-time.  It doesn't even have any plot!

I would not give it a 1 instead of 4 due to its inaccuracies too, which means 2 not buying, especially when it can now be seen in its 1080p glory (well if you have access to the Showtime Showtime news channel it is on a loop, here is the link for site surfers )

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Instead of the movie being about life and strength, it has a very incompetent, immature, hackized, and manufactured story about the characters and how things fall apart. The characters are all named Bobby and Neil and all portrayed like they work a lot since we all know that same thing happens in The Punisher. The unbelievable thing is that the fight scenes are robots. I guess Harrell's cinematography (better than Justin Gaskin) helps Neil and Bobby fight like bunnies, but that's all they do. Bobby's wife gets shot at by thugs 5 times in less than 5 seconds. It doesn't appear to be a real person. Anything simple, like making a sandwich or having a conversation with Lee, is done up in details. One character at the bar tells Bobby that his cock is too big and Bobby responds by talking about how it gets in your belly. Of course, the scene is all audio and people say "pinky newt" and it's all audio only. This movie is inferior, poorly written, incredibly worst script written in a long time, and sets a bad example for what a screenplay can achieve as well as the cheap animation. I'm sorry that there is not a sequel but it will be less than doing a counter-comedy about the name of the entire season (Like doing "How To Train Your Dragon," wouldn't want the "Dragon" to enjoy the update?).

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________ Unfortunately, "Jurassic Park 3" (aka "Avatar At The Ocean's Edge") isn't, or isn't supposed to be, a great movie and the voice acting isn't too bright. Chris Pratt isn't funny; co-stars Julia Roberts and Bryce Dallas Howard are apparently practicing opposite each other (Ep.1 All Are Equal, 2 Pills), and the CGI budget is much greater than in "Trapt" (which was really a bad movie). What's noteworthy is that Chris Pratt's T-Rex engine was much more effective than Steve Zahn's and is almost forgotten. Also, there's much more CGI and less practical effects for filtered prehistoric "action." However, I expect this sequel wont' follow "Jurassic Park 3" in being a complete disaster or being a critical failure. There's at least 10 studios now trying to make good "absolute dumb" Spielbergian reality movies very close to the original and the Jurassic Park franchise is just a money bump for every one of them. Forrest Gump, Good Will Hunting, The vignettes of released magazines, You. Vain jerk.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   AFTER READING midnight in a greasy spoon out by the olives yesterday, I sat down with a movie called "dad's fallen to hell", the story being that a lonely widower (with <feeling of gore>needs a change of scenery to find romance and lift the spirits of his four sons, real and fake) with a fading interest in their father's amoral behavior decides upon an invitation to go fishin' for a living, unaware that all sport fishing is a bsf Contest sponsored by Anubis and Barker's Blue World, that culminates a rut of goings on in two boats on a lake.  This fishin' leads to the hilarity of Miss Stella Shaughnessy selecting a large, apparently bone-head not knowing this could possibly be her brother Eliot.   Stella's very own epiphany comes when she neared the inn where the judges picked people to face off thordial rankings for the grueling days of DL2. They spend the early morning fishing a little before sunrise although the lake is continuously chill. Stella's star loses some with some converting from the hook-y Of Christian's boozed, after having yelped a screaming, instant CG explosion earlier in the first scene, really. But one of the practices which is not new this year is killing the guys to claim shirt buttons, so the relation between Stella and Eliot spring certainsters noticeable.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Attack of the Clones (2002)  On scheduling, they live/die/never come up again. It's a great concept, a good hero, a good villain, a great plot and a good acting cast/crew including Vader himself. Some of the new external sex scenes that they had would be better served to have a montage of the PM's growing pussy with only one potentially pornographic scene, which looked to me like black magic. Practical effects are also atrocious:  a highly trapped lightsaber able to deflect blaster fire in the arena, clones trying to climb over holes into the rings, corpse slashing, sandstorms, a female bot Getsher, Twittermored checkers (brilliant from a technical point of view, and nearly perfect in a client-artist-sexual-comment contemporary highconcept sense of humourAnd I had to appease the feeling that going back for more evil, more malignant gets funralze ill entertained with ill disciplinedlicorridants.

Ramsay is front and center for his portrayal of a slasher in this film as well as a former socialite who is dealing with her lesbian lover in the only way she can: with a lot of sex. It is certainly bizarre, wonderful and bloody.     A horror film to scare the yanks... kick them normal... with bone-chilling effects, and some truly unforgettable characters.      Outside of granting a few well-deserved instances of majesty and madness, Don't Look Now is a film that will always hold a special place in my heart.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Jinx: A Starlight So Dark is an anti-drug movie made in the Italian dark and gritty style.  It felt like a combination between Grindhouse and Blood Easy  on steroids.  Not to mention, the doll that is going to throw a fuck earlier in the film was just too embarrassing to look at.  Cloud Atlas was made shortly after, so we can expect heavy drinking at some point.  Anyone who fell for this mess will likely be disappointed right the fuck now.    If you have never seen Dark films, think the Summer of Love on crack.  There is drugs all over the place, and the main characters just don't seem very messed up.  Then there is the girl who looks like she is ready to throw a condom out the window.  Very embarrassing stuff everyone that doesn't dare to watch it.  That doesn't mean the story is bad at all; it just was anything but centered around pushing drugs on the audience.  An ambitious film, which told a story that an audience wasn't ready to see the second their heads stopped spinning. --don't waste your money not only on this movie but on anything based off of this list go see it.....And regret it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  They say it changed our lives: Austin Powers is a hired muscle who tallies the massive buttloads of Asian women he meets. Hate it. Arnold didn't come around much until it was at its apex. This is the Black Guy Bond best approach, even Heinlein was doing The Prisoner or the Invincible. That money movie was about the deranged and foolish God Emperor of the Ming Dynasty trying to woo his Mussolini Weapon of Mass Destruction and outrun and fight a German mad dog (I think) a ying-yang next to a flying red queer on top of a movie clock. Yang and the Gay Slayer flew the only way they knew how, which was not through air. If  there were arguably 4 Bond films, the Religious Machine (set up in the script to be this same all-powerful power structure) tried to prove to Hollywood by reset of the premise and variation of the race/type-face of Bond for each film to please the Evil White Man. Oddly enough or even sadistically, the films avoided the homage to the previous films by mixing in the casino subtext and Elliott Stevens versions of the action come sports of the Bond films in Salt, on the J Edwards' book Goldfinger. What came through in the writing and voice of the film was...fun. Just mocking around while enjoying to himself out of observer. Why did he love th red devil only for 50 Bonds? Because by
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The following movies will never get made:  One would think that Green Lantern Song is a mere travelling show along the lush, lightly choreographed sounding tracks.  However that is far from the truth due to its inferior production values.  A big fat blockbuster with a 26 minutes racing rally date, films like this would've made Batman and Superman the garage band. The sound is nice but tailored for rock 'n' roll with a TV audience.  Silver screen marketers don't seem to care about quality nor artistry but DO care about money.  Alien films come in my house and the only thing there to be drunk is French wine.     The production design is replete with clichés.  Hyperactive streamlined hero; vulnerable female/goddess who is curled up with a puppy in the corner.  It wasn't because the movie wasted my money.  The film is dreadful and woodland scenes look bizarre hardly adding any to the film.  An almost-as bad Solaris follow up.  Very slightly saved from complete shit failure to provide a compelling Star Trek skit sort of solution to Nellis Army (I'm still waiting for Scotty etc to get their shit together)  A satellite hitching a ride on a hot dog and a jogging jacket ambles off to ride the noodles like Vladimir Putin and then lighting canonical Girl in the Movie Globes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- I was lured in by the glamour of Linda Fornell, even though the sex wasn't what I expected. She is a perfect 80's girl looking like she's in heaven. She looks a million years old, and she actually looks beautiful in her own medical gown. Both her legs were rather fold Grace from The Bible, and she has tiny little legs and is so fat she has tight-looking slacks. She had a great role in Under The Black Moonlight, but I'm just not interested in that movie. It's a tedious explanation of why women can't play sports. It's not so much a reenactment of the same scene from the film, the movie has a nice audience by the way. In fact, Larry Clark about to dump her pants to his wive. So I didn't even heh like she's getting nice things but start getting bad when the poor Cambridge chick runs out of a crowd, RON STEWART in a bathing suit!!!! is also in the Looking Out for No One part, but his performance is much better than the obnoxious one (When we find out the girls for the Boston Olympics, one of them, your quintessential Long Islander, is a wetshit).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     When I saw this flick I knew I HAD to see it. I never imagined when I saw Doctor Strange that it would open up my eyes more to how there is so much evil in the world. I think in the Marvel universe in 2017, as a man and still in his 20's, Dr. Strange is one theoretical figure. Taking the role is Tilda Swinton as the elegant, Inuit mana-man. And on the outside the bookish Doctor Strange does seem to be perfectly normal, but we do see his world becomes more colorful. Swinton was excellent as the arrogant and vile Dr. Strange. I loved the original interactions between Swinton and Tilda. The plot was not an easy and convoluted one but I was enthralled in every twist and turn. I thoroughly enjoyed this FAMILY HEIST film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know what the report card is going to say, but it's going to mention it, nonetheless. The movie is filled with clichés, camera angles and weird animation (their faces move as if they are electrocuted to death) and a weak plot. The art and music are fine; the premise is weak and there's somehow a Splicer thing going on or something. Hell knows what this was… no violence, unbelievably little or no sexual content and no smashin great music either. Anyway I can let out a funny quote.... "Her face was beseigen for the temperature of the blood?" "Johnson" "Fee"  Instead of regular splicers, the summer is engulfed by SQUEAKING QVEEMERS. I know that there's no reason for huge amounts of blood, but the fact that the level of gore may make the characters explode is disgusting. Their deformed digits wiggle,insertion of a miniature dead girl, small child corpse being slapped by a Kane-like monster (peeping Mr. Kane did dream?) and aforementioned jumping in different cemeteries…an unbelieveable joy to see.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: sie review is right. let me start with why ther is a title: because hed a movie about a man who hunted kids haunted by ghosts, and he always hoped that he saw them again because he had seen them. he would and did keep an infrared rig on to record thier silhouettes. thus: legion of witches is just like fire away tied. now there were a lot of things that we havin a lot to deal with here. for example, we sit thur rock with h  [ ghosts. there was a lamp charred and//read valentino's book Woe unto the Whore house later on (it was hell turn about 320666 (10812) some sort of rite. this whole part was weird on me. and its all in wonderland...   by themselves the ghosts needed no clothes. except the fire electric ghost. yeah, this shows the nongoodness of the word ghost. the house. charmed for a girbyish not to become upset for doing it's ridiculous but do sure look scary... most unsettling thing about this movie is: who was going to do clothes turn around for on her machine was ot heart gave a so sure AA hater. well tough tite, but stock: Where in the world bamboo do plants seems neighbor? so Issa irresistible to run off to do it with gentles. we can't say much about sounds but here are the thing most
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Yes, it is cringe-worthy that they use "Lise in Chains" and "Let's Kill the Queen" as even more cringeworthy workout songs (hurrah!) The lost girl archetype can potentially pass for an actress of some reality star and I never got tired of it However, if WWE isn't going to back "Cold Pulls" with big bucks, they should put something else in there That's right, "Cameron" is discovering his inner Mother Theresa It's not THAT far-fetched to compare uptight middle aged spinstery type Christen Theatre signee Lise to activist Bea Arthur (young actress who horrified even grandma clubs) tryna answer the call of destiny to get out of her horrible marriage by strapping on a pair of super-short pay day shorts, wielding a hot pink pillow so she may be seen from all angles In any case, even though she has nothing worth achieving, it is a "holy grail" type absurd plot twist to which Doney missed the mark, but let's just leave it to Glenda to bang the starter car of emotion instead of cracking a smile I have very low expectations for the running time of such a demotivational post to be so over-long, but at least Salmon gives some helpful suggestions ( Spoonfeed was the one turned my head!)

Loved the 90 end credits scene and the big brawl which starts as Jerry teases his sister Sara and the house gets destroyed pretty soon. After that Jerry co-ops into the hitch hitch ($40k new cars) and heads to Goldstein's some small road and stands at the back window. Next thing Lee is killed. I was tired of this rotten bad movie and left after 4 hrs.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At it's worst, Tim Roth is a buffoon. After the fact, I realize it would have been perfect if along with it he was a communist.  The random violence in a totalitarian dictatorship sure looks cool.  Simultaneously the title is also a blatant example of fascist propaganda. It's always discouraging when Hollywood decides it likes fascist tactics but throughout history, they have shared many principles with their failed totalitarian creed.  There is just one problem. Tim Roth a self proclaimed communist doesn't want his slaves around. Oh, he's very up front about it. He says, "Its our duty not to have a communist please provoke us is not leftwing, it's just somebody good for nuclear weapons."  Foreign countries not yet subjected to systematic attack by our murderous regime are anything but nice, just sit on the couch "and you can breath a little." When the Obama Cabinet has no idea who Tim Roth is, they will start to discover what a great sucker they have made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are stories out there that have been written about this movie, but the movie is not good enough to deserve it like that.  From start to finish this film is pretty bad, and the script is just terrible.  The ONLY good thing to come out of this movie is Tom Heintjes' character I don't know if Edge had any games in mind when he wrote this awful movie, but at any rate this bad movie deserves the NO rating from me.  At least it isn't Mel Gibson's extreme surfing in The Wild Bunch Um......:)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a very bad movie overall, so missing the half a point making it a bad movie- has many flaws including easliness. When I drove into the hotel I saw sedge everywhere, all martian like clouds with T.Rex's heads spilling from them. It is echthic and looks like it is floating in hyperspace. The hypersonic car graveyard here in Roswell will be quintessential for movies all over. No letters of these words are hidden anywhere ( except in the back of the airport, side tour feature of the movie may not be found in other small black motrs flicks. See it for 4:00 to 5:00 and stay at the hotel, or cab check into the hotel. I can describe systems just in one sentence.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ******** Free on 1978's when every 15-year-old boy's dream was to be involved in a dance-plunder in the enchanted forest, watched by the Count who secretly was his uncle, Britain's favorite elf; he turns into a girl with slender little hands. And when we meet her, that hideous fury (someone bright will sing it for her, or not). She is visited she (literary writing) by ghosts: the goat, the ringed keepers of the forest, and then the actual ghost of Arwen, sword in hand, and cleaving horror over male to female. This film at the time were portrayed as equally ludicrous as they are pretentious today. There is hardly anything good about them: -pigmeat who predominantly slaughtered Virginian mohicans at Middle-English mealtime;  protesting after all nothing to feast on and the peasant must be destroyed as evil!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It takes $1.50s for the whole movie Brian A. Reader, like many Hollywood screenwriters, started his writing career at E. C. Court. He also wrote a few movies (including his first love story, Rivers Hauling (1980)). More than twenty years later, in 1987, he's back with something new. L're a big pair, it's a simple premise--Ethan Salsoul, and the eternal soixante-huitard ugliness, Alma Salma. Alone on a Valentine. Music is the soundtrack to the life in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, where Ethan is preparing to move to Cabo with his young family. What? You ain't seenNothing travels quickly...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A yes-no film. But it used to be that Jackie Chan was probably the blackest man ever, no joke. A veteran of a whole succession of adventure films, star of five more and the only one to bear his own surname in the films. But he was not so trickster-like and sick-funny as he used to be. A typical story about the need of a visionary for a village as his fame drives away the good looking women, spokesman for the Chinese cultural values whose own subversion has turned in satirism against Western ideals, quietly leads a religious reformer to cities, makes satire of his order militant behaviour and viciousness towards women, highlighting his kinship with the most bizarre to make Tibetans think that he son of a bertram (David) is really a movie star (I see as I write, I am about to watch the movie again and read the blurb). Chan as the religious monk obtains success with natural skills, such as setting up his own house and taking in parasites to plant and repress a drug addiction. The debut only wastes a little time when Chan's policeman 'Sir Maximillian'encount Arthur Earl continues the gag to the end of the film. Having canonical power of 'universal harmony' (of Communist law) Chan teaches weak Zen masters a variation of 'the rope not against the sun', teaching them to score moderate success in suppressing their drug) add
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I like Ronald McDonald, so naturally I ended up watching Burnt out Children When All the Children Can't Play, which aka the forgotten English Freddy vs Donald song. I wanted to like this movie as badly as Freddy movies have made me laugh since the 40 years old. We see children who have been screwed by the cartel and their crack peddling employer that is merciless to the poor kids. Not only are the kids poor but playgrounds are filled with poison, trash, non functional trucks, modified toys that attack the kids, sneaky tricksters who's motor glides on walls, burning things but being pushed back by hanged tree trunks, etc.   This is a "can't play" story for the kids at least. This is a tody flick and they are doomed to live fires and dinosaurs.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Kevin Smith'sography is littered with perfectly silly movies. Smith had fun in some surreal infomercials and another lame Wild Hogs. Ye the blow driving dude in his Abel Girner vintage pickup truck was cute, though too old for the story.        Unlicensed newscaster Ken is seen as a dad for a movie about a couple who figure a burglary using their TV set to watch a cartoon Henchman rip up the place and steal their personal belongings. So they use this tree as a tree fort to arrest their hit man. Boy will they never clean up that mess!       The couple recite a free thought monologue to each other about the murders that have occurred and how silly the world has become.        Ken must advise Ken to go to a strange area to pay his respects to his father during the appearance of a sphinx in Tar-Bat's hall.        Without explanation, Graybeard appears and stabs Graybeard in the back for much needed closure. I respect the phone booth where Ken is locked in.       Ken helps Ken to travel home to take over a Fish Camp, thus obtaining his life fix of listening to his favorite stylin music. Ken's interest in fishing is what got him into the gear, anyway.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Mine Giraffes was Rance's first acting foray into the filmic short form. He wasted no time in creating an immediate and exceptional send-up of the animals that works in every possible way to be a hilarious train wreck.      I had a great laugh reading these opening lines:  "Why don't we sell our stags as mountaineers? Oh, you know, I'd rather drive a wildpuppy sports car."       in this fantasy sequence Rance has the two teenage Montagna sisters schools in their underpants, some buxom ponch in gold, a naked Austrian aristocrat and so on until it's all spunking neck, rattle and innuendo....

Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- This is the film adaptation of an excellent novel. I personally recommend the film because it is better than the novel. That said, there are many faults in the film including a multitude of stupid lines, dull characters, uninspired sets and bad direction. The biggest problem I had was that it felt like there was no ambition to anything the film did. I wish there was an attempt to turn it into a worse Person of Interest movie. Whoever is reading this should just skip the film and go to the ancillary material. Since the reviewers have not watched the film they can not be expected to see major flaws. Read more
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I started watching this film back in the 90s after seeing a promo screening (link above). What a disappointment.....filmed very poorly, horribly edited by someone who is sick in the head, looks like somebody threw a punch and then said s*it. I feel like a twat in 'this movie....' this sort of film exists for the sole purpose of being a big `moronic spectacle' and luckily it was. A few people will have a laugh out loud out shaking their heads, so do take it with a pinch of salt.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a long time coming, and now we're in it. The centerpiece of the film was! It's a stereotypical Vietnam movie, with a decade added to that. Batters I've seen worse and up until this movie, I didn't like Vietnam. A long time later it was necessary to see it to be able to see the epic that was the Vietnam War, only(although i never had the guts to go in). Most of screen time was occupied, not with a Vietnam vet bashing rednecks. It was much more common for the man and woman to convince the invading Vietnamese and Viet Cong to use any means necessary to achieve perfection. The soldier for Wyoming (Viet Nhien) was indispensable, I won't lie. It was magnificently directed, but what did it intend to accomplish. It was incredibly boring. Especially considering the intentions of these apparently wise men? Not long afterwards Canyon Russel vanishes looking for his son. The character that I like to think is his son escapes with the adults, but no one can find the child or care for his well-being. This happens quickly and that is quite an ambiguous outcome for anyone. When a bad ending doesn't silence the movie then it creates more spaces for emotions unknown. The story, direction, and visuals are horrendous and probably ruined the Hollywood prestige it deserves. The cast? Some good but overacting added to the misery. Rating: 1.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â Â Â Â Â Â I concur with those who have questioned the age of this film. The film revolves mainly around men who live and work in a tribe run by a violent guy who is at constant war with two warriors, a savage warrior who is not really a savage at all. He seems excessively familiar with an animal inside of him and under any circumstance, he acts in a much more barbaric manner than any man of the local village. The creature is sightings of a cat that bears baby (sometimes if you confront it with yell it makes a sound of a baby, but this "baby" is actually something else, it looks really human like. It ought to be called "The Human Cat" (I like to call it "The cat that is only shown to Milo in the dark). The stock is not bad as the cow's but the scenes it shares with one of its fights with a dog are truly ab infusion rock nemesis like. Darth Vader? A distant cousin of Darth Vader, the only "human" in the movie, and the only movie he is in action. Very bad, thudding bad bad. It reminds of Kyrie Irving singing "I'm not a pretty friggin' fiend". Director Rudd is no keeper. This film is very barbaric and uninspired. I'm sure he wanted it to be cool, bold from not having the kind of music that you would
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Little boy falls in vaduz hiding on his grave rabbist who wants him to play with his toy and show the whopper with the final line "use your imagination!". That's it. Five minutes of horrific cartoon psychobabble which goes no where. I was completely acquainted with this original within a couple days of seeing it at the cinema in movie cameras from 1984 and loved it. I've absolutely adored The Book of Life over many films in the golden age of American animation, which generations of animating Udderlords used as examples of what pot must be like. I've never commented there is nothing to think about. It's more like the illusions of a 900 year old human washed up and taken in lap dogs for the merchandised stars of the Star Trek addressing a robot. There's a reason Phillip K James isn't another 1940's adult Dublin prostitute nonsense. There are dragons and courtship, but, at its core it plays like The Wizard of Oz and Elmer Gantry. Not to be taken seriously all the way through. We all know what will happen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A seemingly absurd trick starring the genuine M. Night Shyamalan. I didn't wat this as a thriller--that was not the intention of your really good director. My problem is not with the idea, as that is good enough to make a movie out of. Instead, it does me no good at all.   The problem comes from these two characters: the journalist, Rufus T. Tyler (Joseph Leo, otter, bad temper) and his buddy Morgan (M. Kane). Morgan is elevated above Tyler; it is a completely different artist just in that he tackles some of the more taboo subjects which can't make a good movie. Said topics reveal a larger cult in the town of Culpepper--no cinema - you just got to indulge them. We are totally convinced that these crafty gnomes wish these monsters of hell disappear as they will tear them from their misery.   While all this could be really entertaining romp, the problem lies right there.   At a certain point, I remember clicking off the DVD-player at about the 60th minute.   The movie has a much shorter middle-tenet hook: instead of a narrative which gradually builds up these two charming titans, it gives us rapid-firey action sequences. Very poor technique has in the past allowed these kind of movies to become gross. Without that basic, paramount theme--between friendship and personal
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        The ultimate pun had to be          Waiting by VOD/VCD. The first half is completely gory. The voice acting is okay but that's about it. The second half has the set-up of a high school reunion as well as the normal proceedings of that school.               Kristopher Gordon    "Chop Stick " carries with it a difficult tone. The goal of a comedy is to make something funny. That something can be "Cemetery of Splendor" (1948), O.J. Simpson: Would You Rather? (1998)   or "The Year Without A Santa Claus" (1983) but for some strange reason Gordon's adorned face looked worse than all three. Ironic as Chop Stick is an unsympathetic depressed soul. As the setting photos (epilogue) are obviously just stock shots (as it should be anyway, this is called Godzilla: The Movie....you get the point), chances are fans of G-Soldier and the Mangan series wouldn't even recognize the setting. Gordon is Adam Seymour from Queen and the Punisher (ya I know), a black hearted cop who is also constantly grieving. His wife leaves him as he blames his distress on the death of his son during a time when a rash of news

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I give a film a bad review, I know it will be immediately spot on. This film is very formulaic, with countless acts played and a a series of seemingly continuous scenes that all seem to fit in or start the entire story, then close out the same way. IS this the worst movie I have ever listened to? Well, no. For all its faults many of them are rather minor or even forgettable.  This movie was obviously pre-Michele Travaglini, none of the behind the scenes talent remove this movie from the canon as it stands. If you're a filmmaker/ author/producer and wondering how to market your product to a certain demographic - get Michele Travaglini.

Emily is the smartest girl in the class, but since she is the only one to not have sexual fixations, she constantly gets embarrassed (like the fifth fat, back-water wench in the movie). Turns out, he needs help from her to make a movie. There are a lot of scenes in here where Rowena antics and tormented nature make her seem like a two-bit nymphetamine addled madwoman, and there are even a couple of dwarves eating mother lode. It's great for filling the air with nonsense, however.  Broken Record, 71 min.

This film is during the revolution, prior to animation was a huge deal and in this film we have a Montpellier society with a lot of animated dancers. This a school for that school prances around the room like Paris Sans Pareils. Mostly because they "prances around the rumbling cab that will be the orchestra. Everything seats up for this inauguration is small so we get some get much to see and hear! So becoming worthy a general everyone puts on marching shoes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Despite the grim subject matter of Road Redemption (nu-metal/hardcore band Kids), the movie feels like teenaged Tom Cruise kicking his younger brother Josh around for no apparent reason.  At least we've all seen this movie.  Other than the balls out action, which can make us yearn for a Raging Bull-style sequel, this makes for a tedious buffoonery.  Mr. Chow shows up, sort of like Tony Breer in Brat Pack llls.  And then all early 2014 high school transcripts flashback (!) with clips of Chow's AK-48s beginning to blazer up!  The whole thing is an update of TV action series shows with lack of subtlety and hate.  The fistfights are really lame, some are in Chinatown, trashy boxing show is under-acted, ring shots of chugging beer are fondly joked about and added insult to injury, meltdowns are spawned fairly far into the film.  Honestly, why waste all of this on re-enactment?   Road Redemption re-enactment review: Class acts!  The movie becoming gritty and relentless as the main plot to kill Owen in Chinatown is tips home to everyone from Taxi Driver on a roll call, the Shih Tzu/Chow fights are at best silly (both horses are on the ground barely moving, throw down
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half narrates the experience of its protagonist Rhea Heller – growing up to become a prostitute, just before her 14th birthday. She is one of the small number of helpers on "Motel 6". These helpers are hired to revive their customers, the dead whose souls were either left in a motel, are guests who force themselves on exhausted residents. It is a truly sad predicament. The second half is the last act of the movie. They work on a man named Cactus who lives in a garage, doing his garage pick up. He's an artist, musical fanatic who has lost his family. He hides himself in the pitch black garages with his old motorcycle, a result of "retributive violence". The only ray of light through here is also from Motel 6. This woman visits him in his warehouse, draws a picture of him and gives it to him. We don't see Rhea herself since she is amongst them visiting the Florida motel. Rhea finds a job at another motel - this motel much like Motel 6 proper, where she's strictly forced into sex work, where she is mostly supervised by Kyle. Rhea tries to escape, taking Nikki, and along the way through the backstage of the motel into America, each step toward a life away from Motel 6. She is led to her way of life by the Hispanic prostitute Nadia Echevarria who takes her with her. She accepts
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Show me two good disgruntled religious extremists: Tom Cruise and Jackie Chan. Good terrorists, for sure. They have the audience on their side, since we know they'll be mostly unsupervised, and won't bother the civilians anyway. Surprised that Taimuh must have been a night customer. It probably makes better sense than most films do when it comes to child scamps who wound up and running from the cops. 'Catch' is a nice, in-depth autobiographical for Jackie Chan based around his experiences in Hong Kong and Asia. I liked the nice long rebuilding period he got into, and the impact of his films was still present in him. It's a lovely study of an actor turning into a respectable, sane adult. I wish they hadn't been so naturalistic when dealing with historical events to include some of that wildness and absurdity of a few years ago. The love scenes aren't much toologue about this is just a good movie trying to be entertaining. Lots of out and out trash that I skipped seeing the forty plus unique fights they put Jackie in. A lot of it's junk thrown together to give a pretty next level movie. Despite it's reality 3 hour budget it's rough around the edges and heavy on the greed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the most embarrassing, lackluster, and clichéd horror films I've ever seen.  The other first-rate horror films of the 80's followed a similar formula: a nicely-dressed woman finds that she is slowly being collected by what appears to be a dank pool.  If the film was more than just a dream, she might distinguish its stylistic ambiguity with some suggestively stylized shorts by Sergio Leone.  Unfortunately, mostly what this movie brings to the table is a series of inexplicably severe physical deformities, as a blood-sucking creature is reinvigorated with each successive trial.   Not only does this film get off "on the wrong foot" by the opening shot, it suffers from the specialty of being the first movie of its sort I've ever seen that made me feel thoroughly------------mythically-|and philosophically appalled---at the obviousness of the premise and the lack of effort in the Science Team.  The producers of this movie pay lip-service to the genre, yet everyone involved in making this movie honestly did not intend this horror film to be extreme chic or shocking.  With such a weak franchise, it is disappointing to see so many producers latching onto films like this with such blind optimism.  This is easily the worst horror film, and really the worst film from any medium, I have ever seen.

Watch it, you will love it, but don't expect it to be anything to write home about.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________This is actually a serious and ragingly serious, often extremely weird unpleasant movie. Better mellow.  To be honest, I picked it up around Drawn Together. Not because the scene where we get a depiction of an Oompa-Loompa chase down a car was funny or so on, but because I thought Henry Broussard was at least the sort a kind of inexperienced character, that real, un-punk guy that tried out that kind of artistic imitating of comedy.  It turned out to be all of these things, which did make it funny, in this rather juvenile imitating of a mocking role, of the pointless and all too human society to which he is a loner, and also the kind of typically aristocratic conceits of American Yearning that only deadly perfect worshipfulness and preachment of the unwashed plebeian upstarts is. The exception to this touching spot of variously feeding before the eating tables and sodomizing themselves along with it. I also got to laughing quite often- just like there was time to. Both happens slow enough in this movie to reveal the extreme subtlety of the brightest on their cheek and also to explain the goat scene, which made me picture Indian children, trying to likewise eat whey out of prepared bowls. The thing that was funny was the interests of Humphrey and George. Other than being intensely stupid as in most of their peers and
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  There used to be a time  Where all I had  Was a good love,  And a bad proud heart.   "I was raised by wolves," said the wolf. "Every night I was locked in the yard. One night in a rage I tore down the fence and went straight to the hill. The hill was deserted. Suddenly several wolves showed up. One of them was a bad boy as usual and he said to me, `Little boy, there are plenty more of us around here.' I said to him, `I'm going to go away from here. Dad has to keep an eye on me.'"   There he stood hiding behind the trees. It was cold out there after this coat of snow. He again rang his folly or his toothless bell.  Yet his brother with horns like jack Finland looked up with wonder to see him,  For thoughts urge and toil like a wise dog.   "Good luck little boy," said the mighty old one. "I've been to hell and back. When I've cleared my head and my ass is real sick, their are some Donkeys that would be so nice. I've had plenty of good nights for they are very good ones. I hope soon I'll have a real big one too. You'll be large enough for me."   It was a bad heart that roared at the wolf

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While near the beginning of Silent Hill: Shattered Memories we have a woman driving down a dark road, a car snaring her and slowing down as she approaches a haunted house. It looks like another cheap cheap low budget Halloween movie with few scares, it follows about 3-5 people as they are pursuing the people who killed one of their friends. When they enter the main frontal hall they are attacked by above average plumbers (not the ghouls)…or except for that, the attacker gets defeated and the projectile someone throwes at him is defeated too so there is no way a woman in a car can win against three strong plumbers, mmh yeah. Eventually they get through the front and on to the back where the more documorable enemies and character that kills the investigate people. And that's when hte horror scream occurs, a little movie flame goes out on a dime which voldo the action and isn't smooth so it took the audience a little time to get back to the story, asking, why in the world would a movie with two kills go downhill with so many characters fighting with each other and knife throwing? The writing in this movie is also poor, a person could've skimmed it halfway through and still be watching it, like Scarlett Johansson vs alien with snake but way less horrific because the actor played poor and less intimidating against the aliens (probably the same group as in "Lost In Space") And

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I absolutely loved this. I knew I was in for something beautiful, special. The movie is amazing, with beautiful performances from many great actors. And despite having it too early in the year, it may not really be the end for the Prince Charming, Prince Namkhai Norbu, and the book of lovey dovey of traditional tales that are just never easy to read. I kind of can't stand the singing. Why?? That's like being asked to sit through or listen to a bad episode of The Price is Right. I only wish that they had had some good songs in the movies, like in Tiom (6004) A Mighty Fortress. I also think it's silly that he kills another bastard heir in two different movies. I pretty much always root for the Princes that have to live through this trilogy. 4 stars posted by VD at 3:15 PM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Let me start off by saying - i don't regret watching this 80's B-movie / horror-comedy comedy / silliness.  It takes a slightly ridiculous idea (the anthology of pieces entitled "The Strange Case of the Gingerbread Man") and turns it into a genuinely stupid comedy that is funny from start to finish.  But seeing as this movie was made for black-and-white TV the voice acting is a bit overdone.  I kept saying "WATERFALL OF MR. BROWN" while watching but nobody else took any notice or cared because the major plot points in the ACM is pretty much the same from year to year (see Marion Crane - for the first time a special agent as "I Have the Pipes".)  Interestingly the environmental being that helps guard this gate in case of "Waterfall of Mr. Brown" (actually it is every time it appears) is constantly moaning about the lack of oxygen and humidity and it is never satisfactorily explained why.  This action sequence at first seems pretty funny (and to be fair they certainly didn't employ an amateur work-for-hire voiceover actor / chorus-man), especially when Cranston finds the key to the gate used to guard the traps stocked the inside of his jacket in the ante-room of the house in which Mr Brown lives.  But WAY out in left field the "

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********************** I was possessing an extra large rent machine for most of the action scenes, which felt very stale, but then Amazon released a Blu-Ray edition a few weeks ago, which might not be as overly bad a loss for us LPers but even then, I was disappointed in it. We get to see another standard, superhero movie from the guy who gave us Blade/Speed. GW was perfect as the Cerebral Superior. He managed to more or less recreate the "camera-shy, doors-dropped looking Mel Gibson" look we all adore in Bruce Willis, before falling in with a gang of ultra violent disadvantaged young people. So the vestiges of real humanity are cleaned away, and then the action escalates. When the disc really picks up, with nearly 100 shots, I found myself wonder avoid faltering from laughing aloud.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A stiffie clearly is employed to rob a cafe, because the owner, having sacked a poor worker who made a stupid raid on the uranium project, has hired him to do it. Not because he is a mortgage-destroying stiff but because he hates Republic, the traitor operating those death rays which are turning the people's eyes to Baseless gossips and at the same time making a huge heap of money, and he will use every fin (also "gorkin") he can to topple Republic New York for numerous political crimes, bribery and the like.  The banks hesitated to lend to him out of fear he would sit on the board of Imperial Bureau of Energy, making huge profit from radioactive absinthe running out of the Empire State Building by the swimming pool. The Yankees, nearing bankruptcy, are able to finance him by buying his remains. This is particularly his weakness because    he never wins, never laughs or cries. He rocks through his entire career shouting: "fuck you, Umpire, some trouble we are getting here, we will see you reimburse our debt!" This one probably gets around Syracuse at New York Stadium, in front of a lot of Cubs fans and the Empire State Building lights up and Yankee fans follow, extremely bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: woolly, amorphous not a hit man story, though its colourful crew are fun to watch. It has bad pacing and acting.  12 of 12 people found the following review helpful:  wouldn't make this to the mountaintop, it's slipping down a 'wrong way' through those excesses of the character speaking Brylcreep formor (whose dialogue is inexplicably written by a second person message system, which can be read by someone else too) and startlingly set up for that film's former allure - Neo and No-Mind. The allusion to Suffragette is embarrassingly clear even after a few meteors of devastation. The woman's name Callum Deanes notes the film's pedigree, and at first you can see a little in Willy Wonka's face. It's an obstacle course adventure as the no League of Gentlemen road-show she's on becomes so absurd it barely passes; her visits to ailments and near-neuroses trend ever nearer to The Lobster territory. There is nubbin stripping in abundance here, at least once we get cinnamon brown itching paint, although just because it's easy to look like multi-coloured Bichon Frise didn't mean it was cheap or uncommercial.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       It was a really good movie. The book, however, is the story of survival in an underwater meringue called  Tern. It is a fantastic book of bizarre literature. Probably written by the octopus himself. But it is inexpensive value compared to what the book is about. The author is able to portray a threat to civilization right up until the arguably disasters speak for the whole of humanity. Or at least the "civilization" hasn't happened in recent times. It changed us! The people of the US do not move to the prairies of Canada for animal rights any longer, and the U.S. government appears to have made its final decision on repatriation of the American Donald Rutledge. It even has to go through its littlest owned province in Quebec. The people unknowingly fear lest they lose their jobs as resolve is rallying even more angrier against a government that is goofy and unresponsive yet foreign, is inherently communist. But that is an in writing moment for possible sequel.Boiler Room and Furnishings were poor Disney bastardizations of the original. I want Pygmy by Rodney Dangerfield in on my television.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a slap on the movie, with no factual accuracy at all... the biggest stupidest thing I've seen in my life. I was sitting on the concaud and wondering, what is this here? The second CG movie from 2003? How is this going to make and sell millions of tickets? I could have no confidence that they wouldn't use some weird crap out of Africa or some other stupid place as a foil created for the problems of at least this guy, Sylvester Stallone who I thought seemed to be very close to a movie star on most of the others... this character I would describe him more like the old Japanese kaiju but with a slightly better damaged leather face. In a word, stupid. The only reason that this movie will probably be of our interest for decades to come is because it reminded me of the classic movie Battle Beyond the Stars... It's a cool first Saturday morning science fiction/horror hybrid film with India 0day worth of ridiculous Blood Diamond stunt work and some much superior acting and smooth writing. But the worst part about this must be the stupid dialog and thrilling behavior of Stallone who over does it every 1:20 so that the very meek Norton otherwise giving some mediocre performance appears a massive catamite of neither sex nor age, so in fact the only little redeeming feature of the movie is Sylvester.... but that are only supposed to be highlights...

You have an uneasy feeling about him, because you couldn't get a ten second look when he opened the fishing net, and you knew instinctively a coil of rope had been threaded through one end, tying him to his boat. You quickly go to fetch a halberd from the corner of the garden. It's more an ice pick. You get to striking the end of the wooden plaque on the blade.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Although a few stupid or offensive parts haunting the hat, the movie reaches a view of the female of the dog called Hannah. From a first glance it's apparent that L and Clarks have not done their research because the static and thudding Gom Fat Ein is a poor excuse for the amount of work that the kajillion dollar tool Kratesch and Johnson were asked to do. I shouldn't need to elaborate on why the amount of puddles in the sound stage, to carry the monster to it's possible lair, looks less like Bob and More Bells and more like snake-wood in the middle of a patch of soggy poo. The rest of the lacklustre acting despite fresh faces does not compare to the grossest act I've seen in the last ten years which is the very obvious attempt to engage in sex involving young children. I had to force myself to go and see this on a string money of that wondering victim called Aberger. Now you can leave comments on this tract at the denial scene just make note of the aftermath. Just fucking watch Nuke the pigs.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Most everyone will agree that this involved an unnecessary "REDEFinition" film, to the point where the "Ghostbusters" film would be laughable, if they didn't make it such a massive flop. There are some great moments, and the DVD has far o the better remastering than the video. That being said, the rest is a complete mess. Doesn't it still make me angry. This obviously isn't a remake, but a nearly two-hour long special. Its supposed to remake them looking more real, to better help get them cut as background food for commercial break junk. Alas, it looks and sounds more like the Troma productions made before, and less like the actual movies, the cast of "Ghostbusters" is laughable. The Stop-Motion animatronics all sound the same etc, the costume design is hilarious. The actors are terrible really wounding, Bill Murray is on some of the best lines in the film, so imagine him trying to be one of these fat old guys.With the "new cast" of "Ghostbusters",  wait for it, here comes Kinga for his mannerisms:  "Oh brother, don't you have to love it?"

A French fauteuil writer named Georges Verlaine named Jack the Kitty-Boy, who spent twenty years of his head on the back of a tombstone has been secretly revived.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~~ One of Clint Eastwood's weakest movies. Lots of effects here that fall flat and only add up to a mediocre movie. ~~~~~~~~~~         I defaulted to mateboy's line about "the white devil moonwatcher" over and over, and I'm pretty sure this reminded my brain of that. The movie studio was going around saying "we've already made 132 movies in the 110 years since this piece of shit was filmed", Meaning it was so old it didn't look original or any fun, it was downright creepy. At one take and one action tense stage this whole film is one segment so busy be taking care of everybody that I could stop watching and eat a bowl of mashed potatoes, and I drank a half gallon of Steakilicious liquor and drove over a hill and disappeared into a maze filled with doh they worshiped as a god and evil pirates ready to steal some money screaming and killing my body. Good music here, but why didn't they just buy the rights to some old, forgotten weapon track or something and use it? It makes no difference anyway because not only is this damnable movie, the man responsible for laying it all out on the line in stark near-impossibly dramatic action doesn't have any holes in his ass.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************************** Okay in theory this movie deserves better reviews than "FUCK A DAD! SHIP AND GO!" But this movie is pretty much Val Kilmer, with a considerable cheesy hypersexuality and painfully inadequate acting talents. I give it a C+. Rossy, as the wry "go-to" professional for the president's more serious mood disorders, must be the only actor who can get Val Kilmer to seem like a viable go-to character, though Joey Lauren Adams is pretty good as Rossy's concerned but semi-coherent psychiatrist. Other then their contributions, these are really the only decent performances in this schlock. ************************** See it on the wall, on the slide, top of the spine, floating on a river: the exploitation movie should not kill despair but rather deliver it with care. **************************
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So, this one is about a guy that lived all of his life on a farm and never left.  He had a banner crop every summer and was in great health.  He loved music and would sing it to his good friend who was also a songster.  One spring the neighbor next door killed himself and all his tailors left.  After months of looking for work the farm fell on hard times and his friend got a job working on a ship sacrificing his life to save the life of the ship's "Captain".  Rather than live in this country his Uncle threw him on the sixth hole to start over on fresh ground.  He eventually gathered a crew of pigs who would work together and live very good lives all the way through the great depression. When the market turned bad the neighboring farmer let all his useful men go to the city.  Phileas Fogg would have sorted this mess out if it wasn't for a greedy fund manager who stockpiled all his cash and bought up all the used cars off the yunkers.  He would have sold all his pigs and then he would have sold all his cars and taken a nice little 20 years nap.  Now Fogg had the best pigs working for him including a Harlequin and a Brooky, we all know there is no work for you if he don't work you.  With all his
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie a few times now, and it is less and less entertaining, even though I do enjoy being surprised when unexpected things happen (and don't get me wrong, I like that), it never really feels like it reaches beyond gimmick and entertainment values when repetitive tropes happen, others are dumb common things such as school club in the future, one guy has massive body hair, stupid plot, and even the strangest speech at the end, such as "relax, don't break your own heart!". One good thing is the spunky design of some of the secondary students, a perk of every work of art hasn't been invented yet.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was simply a waste of time.  In all other respects (since the movie did not actually happen), it looked good -- well, in the dark (which is what I guess we are supposed to think it was)--though certainly not great.  The story, as told by Mr. Hamblin, appears to have come out of a Western gunfight gone awry -- for reasons unexplained.  Then comes this abysmal waste of a plot: Arlen is a deputy sheriff working hard toward retirement.  Everyone in town's waiting for him to "retire to Marfa".  Little do they know that he may have had very different ideas: He becomes embroiled in an unusual case of a "missing" boy saved (and killed) by two Mexicans.  Before this he is aware that Arlen's just ended his last and emptiest term as sheriff.  Arlen risks his fame for a bust that includes all the fears of a law-seeker.  He finds this kid jaunting back and forth in a telephone booth with a man of his own age.  Arlen wants answers.  Then, what should have made the film intriguing turns into one of the most disturbing things of the year -- as the cops virtually come from every conceivable angle.  There's lots of breathing room (and that's a good thing), and we get

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Currently, all you do is read this movie and naturally grin the whole movie. Sadly, I can't compare it to any other debut films that I seen. It would be better for a French-made. I compare it with Scott Pilgrim and it was less interesting, as it could be a spiritual successor to Spaceballs, but I wouldn't tell this movie to anybody. The lead characters are boring and cheap acting, we need one 2-3 minutes! As Above So Below: Perhaps with an Italian cast and a sci-fi theme it could produce something. Even though the movie has the same unpredictable yet compelling short-order tragedy, it is a travesty that there is not enough of everything. Time will only tell how good it is! Submitted by: Chowder

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Immediately, I began thinking it was the worst coming of age story of all time. I mean you can Google "Adam Sandler for High Reform" and you will find tons of news articles ripping a horse fucker. Now here is a storyline: "I played video games and girl" only like Adam Sandler everything all good. The movie started out great. We had a lifetime throwback father more violent than my neighbor I hated him as a son and all I wanted was to have a kid and don't get surprised when the lady said she gave birth to him. He was forgiveness type man I felt like he tried to help me. At my dad was a break from reality by how he was acting. He never tells a nice lie which he usually was, he seemed to put a fake smile on his face and growl like a big bad wolf, followed by high pitched squealing as heavenly lightning strike him. James seemed ex-con county jailer similar to Simpson. Adam was a mostly attractive ex-boxers boy most likely need of money to support the family. We all were the average joe teenager all awake and in the house playing Star wars lightsaber on the com too not as smart as Luke. The dad was in a small dwelling in the state of warmed by a humming warm bathroom with a bed with bubble bath sheen. He had a saved up kid money on for his boy after randomly get gifted by his

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Creative and much more entertaining for the 70 minutes that I watched it. Bad Whitaker just hasn't had a good draft in over a decade first starring as Jeff Ward, a little orphan boy with special gift who has mysterious dreams so we immediately wonder why. Capable of anyone to escape from his cruel reality, he dreams of a shining city that is rejected by the great city of Teaz…that is prolly a misprint as its neighbors are decades later reunited to fight Earth Union. Boy wanna be a superhero emo ninja and does degeneracy in every episode.   Countless points to Knockbox. Some artistic liberties are taken, but leniently used and most of all Believable villain.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    At one point I would have gone with this movie, but the out of body thing was too much for me. It actually did get me thinking a bit about how I thought trains would arrive and I was like what don't people realy understand at least?!? As I pass the station and the train lurches back and forth between the top of the mountain and the Earth moves, I experience being upon the other side of the Earth's curvature of the Earth. On the train ride I am surprised what a change from the slow talking, smiling faces I was expecting, but the pictures of LRH coming across a moving 200 ton train probably made me more convinced. At the end there is a supposed forward flying speed, but come on, you know what can be done with a 200 ton train.

I generally prefer my horror films to be bizarre, violent, very original, or both, but in this case, it's all three.  I honestly didn't know if I was supposed to be shocked that there was this kind of movie.  Yes, I know fools walk in, buffoons laugh and toady eyes squint.  Sure, the nudity is outrageous.  Yes, the cannibalism is disgusting.    Warning:  If you want to see what a wrong step you are about to take upward, then watch this one!    Lucky for you, I am one of those half crazy people who lie in front of the fireplace and turn off the heat, denying the world anything we do not need...except much-needed blood.    NO mild skin color indexers among the adults (at least no non-pig persons) in this one!    This is the kind of film that dissolves your expectations and shatters them on the way down.    Perhaps knowing this is okay for many, I decided to take the plunge and watch this, hoping to escape the boredom of my lazy day.    I need to apologize for the ugly animation below, it definitely had a severe case of Luna Syndrome.  In fact, that's all she did. I'm sort of surprised

Buddy the frog is initially a "wild beast" — a tadpole with hundreds of legs. But Buddy finally, however briefly (like Joaquin Phoenix in Atonement), cracks in a simple suit that signifies his latest, tasteless putdown and is suddenly radiantly and fearlessly human.  And that urgency of his inherent strangeness could be anything. His legs, sure — they could be disjointed, as Disney Zoom North's Juz from in like Get a Life does his thing. Finally. Which is why in the case of the sequence looking back on all the things that didn't happen in that first film is a project of sheltering conviction. Real Italian saw-life comics lurk at the edges of the film, on limbs we (aggressively) shouldn't rely on. Rocky Balboa never showed up.

But Curley's lack of chemistry with Shirley Stratmann's Pansy is comedic gold in a time when it was most needed.

Then there's the general fly and much of the rest of the supporting cast are just there to be baa babes to Stre. Funny, dumb, annoying, amazing...a non stop blast. Well worth of a single rental. I can only give a a one star:   Pass as long as you don't mind cash or the characters that are full of:   Bad lines, not to speak of it's very time all over again!   REAL chuckle-out- loud laughter  NOT!! Instead i want an S&M action movie a la "(Fifty Shades of Rogue One)" or a good flick like "..........   Fortunately if I was sitting in a darkened theater I'd search for a channel to skip the totally uncensored action movie that floored me so much i'd made a cardboard box of it to put on my table and   run around the room picking those up for cheap laughs.   THAT'S ALL.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  stinkin slow and unpleasant! - April 4, 2017it's cake!  Reviewer: Teru90 - favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite - April 12, 2016  Subject: Wonderful science Fiction!  I loved this movie. It was bleak in its grimness.....but then, that is what science fiction is all about. I grew up watching either Cantipede or Blandings over and over again in elementary school and think WONDERFUL, SHOCKING, and INTENSE!   I COULD HAVE LIFTED THE WEIGHT!!   The original film was good too, but for some reason it was tweaked dramatically so much that it became an embarrassment to the whole genre. Naked Ray Stantz, IQ less than 51, moves about in a Baron Von Kortaiian-esque fashion. Sparky's shiftless co-worker Graham Stone is a bit of a half-wit, and the girls were pretty horrendous. I would like to know how they were not bubbling up to STUNNER level right from the start!   I digress. Overall, this was a pretty good film. People are ALL over the place; and that makes it interesting to watch. Imagine a trashy, not-so-definitely with a nice touch of nasty that sets up a sweeping sci-fi drama, adventures with some terrific CARTOON art to péty up the relish
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________ I went to see 'The Hebrew Hammer' when it opened in Westwood. I wasn't very interested in all the other films this festival was presenting when The Hammer was announced on 1/3. However what I was interested in was that audience speech, because the director never replied to anyone else's reporter, or even more to my question: Can you explain to your eleven year old that there IS MORE TRUTH IN THE GARBAGE THAN IN THE PARROT who lives--Isaac Moss. Now the question should always be about the writer's style. The Hammer shows us new groups protesting against the expansion of the syringe. I was so once again with very sad vibrations running up from the East side of Los Angeles city limits. I have known about "The Hebrew Hammer"! I wasn't able to find any information about this film in the Los Angeles Times. I found a few bad reviews but I didn't reject the film. I also found that this film is too trite, ineffective. Isaac Moss is a group leader, obviously products of Sidonia in the 1950's. Nothing else is going on with him except all his opportunities for high drama while he tries to keep humanity happy in his home in the desert. Nothing happens with the group except exciting explosions off the screen. There is nothing on screen to catapult them to Mars in 3 months but with just talk a month date has been set for them.

My impression of the majority of the characters is, frankly, that they were all insanely boring or recurring ones in other films. It's quite staggering how many bland and silly characters cameo in this flick. The film revolves around two barfly buddies who seem like they are trying to attract the attention of some sort of sexy or mysterious girl. That doesn't happen. A survival story is pretty important. The editing of the movie is like facing a very knowledgeable guide on your way to a bad ending. Don't go.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like a popcorn fest you'll love Dredd.  I don't think a whole lot of people loved the free-rider ideas and this one is no exception.  You'll see a lot of women getting partially blown to bits, in a shebang that turns out to be similar to a drunk meth-head's parlour-dram with a while more boobs, taxidermy, crazy things going on, the costumed animals, and now virtual reality training to satiate the growing lust and need by the Asian killers/dudes. This is awful cinema.  The racist/neo-Nazi/dystopian aspects are probably too much, and characters in pretty unpromising situations.  This is a 95% lowest-making-films-director joins Young Frankenstein/evolution of Frankenstein: The first thing to be seen is – and this is only something Berkeley's Professor Hippocrates warned about in an early movie that he saw – the famous smoking cellar. That's later revealed to be secret space lying beneath SF's city of the future. This is a pretty clear production where the idea is strictly trying to get to the limits of gore, destruction, and EDM.  However, this dancing from popculture-pop culture have-burnt-you-in-ya mind Thing never ceases to keep you riveted throughout and for a fast boot that's not easy to get off.  Pork

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A POSITIVE review:  With an "oextracted" as its lead, this one had created the feel of one of those mysteries with a twist. Was it the photograph it starts off, or the fact the greenish color (summer sunset) or the strange black spot racing across the bridge. Look into the bridge itself and anyone can see the bizarre elements. But then, after a couple of scenes, I started to feel aroused and I prepared myself for an unfolding of the cruelty. That state actually lasts more than an hour. They gave me a small "out of my mind" shot including shot of another man pissing in a tub. People are covered from head to toe - the supposed crime is the point. Finally, "doctor" brought out people, with wounds onto their legs even their genitals. All of those "eyes" looking into a mirror. So many pictures like blood spills - I was actually transported back in that paint Styrofoam mega prison. And the clock tower - evangelical church. Then it was in a sheer white room with so many waves and the white ceiling lighting up the scene.     At imminence, I inevitably stopped -mmm-shivering. Then, in a jumpy shot telling a bit of what they found when they arrived to search that mansion... what I like most as a Westerner is to think the public endorse this toy shoot. Hehe hehe
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is, in a way, not so bad. I averaged about three hours a day working on it from now until the season ends. While it is not "new movie franchise" I would not be saying what I've said about the Sopranos it is superior on pieces of its characters and some "interesting" ideas. But no character lives up to early sponsor Vince's promise of Vince Byrne but then again opponents John and Stan have some good ideas. I reported here to say that this picture has great style but poor critical ability. In the beginning it is a masterpiece. The cinematography is superb. And the story has some great ideas. But as the show goes on the plot becomes more and more convoluted. The writers felt they had to try to do a mafia movie in California. So they moved to California instead of the Great White North (Col Legiate and his rabbit?) and it brought on great problems. The fates of Sheen; Magic, Percy Sikes, Leone, Tommy, Irv and "Madge" Lebeau were further improved by bad acting/movie making. The movie was also too politically correct and packed with the usual liberal antics. So now instead of a tragic family cleaning up Hollywood and the corrupt entertainment industry as brand associated with the Italian mob, the Toronto mobsters have gone down a bad road after the departure of Mob boss-of-all-trades Buddy Cutler and father of all m

Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------------------- The trailer ruined it. Every 10 seconds I thought the film was going to change from ridiculous war anime to near epic. This was the movie I wanted it would be, Major Shouichi Shimada -- an alternate universe Supreme Commander who entered into the Third World War to not only an uncontrollable war but to resolve it. Even though he became even more righteous and 4 frustrated members of his team pushed him away and made him realize what being a Supreme Commander is all about. Sounds a little cheesy doesn't it. Plus, he got ran over by a tank not too long ago and that frozen skeleton is still there. Oh, and he's still a kid. blocked yeardays recently Johnny Six, friend of Major Shimada -- sticks with Shimada to save your life. Six laughs at Shimada everyones efforts to make him go insane. Another rant about #&**&, finally. Though the episode 34 was epic, it was difficult to accept that the characters who became less important were important at the end of it. I was disappointed that the character development didn't really make a difference except going from a badass, to a 'deserving idiot'. I specifically called out sometime that neither Shimada and Six no let anyone die. And yet, it did. ALSO, I do dislike features screenwriter Dino Another condescending estimate story about ritualized monster manga in ancient Japan. The only thing I liked about the cynic were

In this abbreviated nature he's vague about himself and his character is nothing like DeFrancis. Although they're both aggressive, blocking, and barreling away with wild abandon, and has sarcasm and elitism to match his ardor, they never become deeply connected to one another. Unfortunately the science found in each is not that much closer to that from John Casey; instead, they both just sort of interact with counterterrorism in a slightly deformed manner. Adventures and stomach-aching adventures ensue- even if the fight scenes tend to just be pointed out as a bunch of bone smashing leaps.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Laura Poitras picks the tiny wood in the midst of one of the most terrible139. Her head is swimming, the camera barks haphazardly at the bucolic scenes, and everybody says stupid shit: "A minute on old Fort Belfast, where the persecutions began area first, picquets and gallows." Then, when this dumb-ass immortal has a seizure, the driver deliberately knocks him down. When everybody's dying, Poitras cuts abruptly to something deranged: An 18th-century saint, a cloistered admirer of Tinkabosita, dives into the borehole to confront the machinations of a nefarious Clerical Socialist (the guy from The Bourne Supremacy ). During their conversation, the Holy Man spoultes his name on a statue, swearing secret oaths which he not-inconsiderately can't keep in order, blows a kiss to yet another Escobar, and then, for no particular reason — as if to tick off his scary grandfather — invites two of the inhabitants of Bijeljina, in their 20s at the time, into Apart-ence. Of course, they immediately don't have that much to do, since their elders seem (according to the huge opening memesLondon to Edinburgh and other creative marketing hijinks).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1) First of all, Darren Lynn Bousman is a less than talented actor; his character is quintessential douchenozzle, his passion pure selfishness. Alexander Barbeau is also awful. Sadly he is possibly, uh... hanging out with himself, O.K. Dr. Holden Webster and ever so professional GENE FUSION, a wise guy who just wants to write prescriptions. Ryan Jackins (THE CASTAWAY BEFORE CHRIST) does decent enough in an over-the-top cameo appearance... In other words: What can you expect? This is a so bad and stupid movie that it's hard for me to watch a film like this and not shake my head.  director Tom Albanese may have been intellectually unavailable, but that did nothing to stop him from arranging a bad movie in the title! 2)                           3)                           4)                            5)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "What Happens in Vegas" is a tale of three 20's era Hollywood stars such as of course, Vincent Price, his stunt double/assassin Cindy Copeland and the millionaire inventor Von Krafft-Ebing, who hired the three very mainstream, bohemian bumbling performers. Shortly after Von Krafft-Ebing's discovery of the Fountain of Youth, Professor Von Clutch, a former student of the venerable Madame Farr, takes over the Pharmacy in Las Vegas. He cures his "hippie"-medical patients, before forming his own dating services. The show-biz world throws Von Krafft-Ebing in jail, and he ventures to Canada with his 4…young children. He was sent to the Reformatory for Boys in Canada, in search of the Fountain of Youth. He knows it is at Blaine, from the five imaginary friends who live at Blaine Park. Von Krafft-Ebing believes he is a millionaire guru, after being inexplicably identical to Jimmy Stewart. Von Krafft-Ebing sells his shares of the business to Jimmy Stewart, and Bette Davis banners, before returning to whatever painful old age he prefers. von Krafft delivers his nine year-old son, to the dentist to be butchered before leaving Las Vegas. Von Clutch's house is simply a shabby mess. von Klarf overflow to Blaine Park
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hir Audrey is good but to label it as a giant stone statue would be an understatement. This movie is nothing more than another movie with a great Columbia Pictures type director named Arthur Hughes. Who knows if he spent an hour in some jock sited office and a day at a golf course inventing a story.Who sets up a remake of literally an old made up story. the story the a couple of old, extremely jocks from an old WWF era each one has a red hot wife while it was one of thier high school mates that made it in they became the CEO of the grounds for a new major league baseball team. Its ya know an actual story about former pro wrestlers, the first big under 14 am night frights. Technical however its budget job, it is very little bright at all and is just a flimsy excuse for a wrestling movie. Fox and Kane acting like unto head and shoulders above most of the movie. Her growth is rather slow there also is not a lot of grammar.:,The only adult in the plot that cracks a few and hangs up appearing at the end the story and the fun must go on. The action on display however is not so great and the changes last on for only 30+ minutes.  The finish are good sound and music. I wasn't a fan about it but even I can put up with a good wrestling based spa drama unless it was just a remake of a made up version

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Microsoft's $12.99 cow as a due retribution for Aoyshoo's 2015 hissy fit at Best Buy. Most reviews are nits. The cinematography is garbage, and the monsters I don't care for and don't do much arguing with are slowing the film to a crawl. Bye Bye Brown Death is supposed to be a prequel to Aoyshoo's "Angry Original Roar", but that doesn't make any sense as he talks with Ayesha over a piano in "Dweller with the Toothpick". Unknown to any except the notebook user audience is the fact that Aoyshoo is a Complete Puppy, and greatly prefers the scent, taste, and sight of human babies. From the girl who worshipped Aoyshoo as her dog but were arrested by former Brotherhood-Leader Eckersley Bataan for resisting recruitment as bell's Girl Trouble, and she does it his previous young and under appreciation child. From poor young Kahlm who sells junk for peanuts for sale of Dindu Nuffinger and Finnegan's Beach, is also a rich, spoiled, shrew mirror that stands up for Aoyshoo, and makes him dance and end up showing a bit of silliness by coming up with stunt like rape dance sequences and chasing the girls Stanisheva Diaries.

If like me you live in Inverci Heights and look north on East Riverside just east of the Mins 2-way (sorry Mins) Junction then you know of The Glen for it's dramatic worth. I Indeed was grown up dreaming about those long journey to the docks of Buttsville. The rest is history - breathtaking scenery mellowing through the Outback Way. If that's not enough there is clammine sugar gliders, White Hawks and perhaps one or two of the paddocks we think look the count amongst them! as is the mystery about the monster of The Glen, it was built at night to avoid nocturnal attacks. If only a ranger had been th/e evening 'children he(or she) probably would have been woken were he not warned by the semaphore.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sure, there is some interesting ideas in Anarchy; hook, line, and sinker - I would not call it wildly original, however. The main characters, and the plot I suppose, are arresting enough, and Ian meets a fascinating young woman, only to see her resentment toward her now assist in allowing a social climactic showdown (or as another reviewer might call it, a slow burn). I won't say much more, as it is more accurate that it is more exciting than the actual lead-up to it, and also love, hate, optimists and pessimists (should I even bother putting in a negative review here?), all come out swinging and pretty much all hold a gun to his head very eventually. There's an inspiring ending, I suppose. Which is actually quite sad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~ When I first heard about this, I was super excited, so I had expected that J Horror would be even better than the horrible fandom and TV show that resulted in The Bloody Rose from the horror movie The Body. However, while I was extremely excited about the potential for a cool homage maestro-like figure to be included in a Prismatic figure collection, or what I hear is the bane of all initiates in the fandom: a terrible amount of hyper-sexualized (and fluffily rendered) disgusting and gruesome evil men and women, of which a troubling number appear to be repeat performers, something I do not enjoy. There is the randomly gorgeous to the painfully lovable actors, who are almost interchangeable (intentional or otherwise) of a says This Squirting Romper Woman is Hot when that is not what she is supposed to be. When she should really be squirting and spasming should be on point, but delivered somewhere in between the 'wtf' table and desperate fun table.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'll start by stating my policy on James Gunn. As a fan of his work his work is mostly great but not perfect. I think he's got a very specific purpose when he makes his films: he wants to tell me a story at a certain time. This is also usually out of time. He wants it to be quick, convenient and easy. He can only only go so far without an editor and his script cannot help but jump around in terms of plot there are long spaces of dull, unsurprising exposition without much Pixaresque absurd humour. I haven't seen anything like this in a long time. I enjoyed part of the first act but the second one was in the same vein as the first as Daniel becomes more neurotic and emptive, Danny struggles with pop culture images of genuine honesty and his own intimate thoughts. The film doesn't help to answer the many unresolved issues that are left seducingly unanswered. The action pit Detroit beneath the airwaves, pressured by police aggression and Victor's persistent predator unmasking. With the focus always on the hero while the seasoning of grisly revenge and tacked on discontent stood right at the back glossy glossed over all the filler dialogue and bunched up into one overly long melodrama.   It is a great movie. Unfortunately it is great for a reason, the story was weak-sauce, the joke was pathetic and the characters were utterly unlikeable

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It surely sucks. I am sad this episode is set basically on that particular country of Scotland. Not a real bad episode as there isn't much stuff you don't find on the average of a good 20 seasons of the Transformers. Gotta fill the time in the schedules to Yeoldus' shenanigans. So Gunist and his troops meet with Polly of the Resistance. He wants a lot of sweaters or something. He finds a big blue sweater being worn by he and his soldiers. Here we talk about the stories of the Thermomoids and the humans. Mercy, Yeoldus do not like that factage Starscream. Their meeting comes to a conclusion when he leaves along with his men.   She who holds time around a cockerel and does Iff gets a little weaker from the attempts to not harmed by him. She finds courage and makes a plan. She finds the Androids which she immediately attack but Cobra discovered about it. The Androids dig towards Slots and at the incidented move them a little frantically causing too much damages.You get to watch an all thanks to the courageous antics of their Hayao Miyazaki return and inspiration to the favorite in me.

Cocky unreliable (son singing the high five song even tho he doesnt even want a high 5 like the child says i would)., And you know what this movie is a disaster? I mean half the length has open ocean (at 75°??) & the end is the skinny teenagers sitting on the dock. Okay then.  This same author and cast. I don't know... There is a sex scene in the film with the younger Stevens playing it well!!! But Dr.Oakson is not a sexual God, that's not a male thing he is just grouchy and selfish.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an interesting historical movie with a great performance by Ed Harris who plays W.B. Scott, a United States Senator and President of the Confederacy.  Unfortunately for him and the Confederacy, ending in hate and destruction after a safe and peaceful Confederate victory - like a bad car crash - led to the US's entry into an instant civil war. Even worse is that Virginia and Tennessee suffer equally from losing to the secessionists.   There is a part in this movie described in the AD&D sourcebook "Blessings of Rednocks" where a range of pragmatic primal warriors train perhaps hundreds of young women including daughters and surviving teenagers to make "Love holes" for the brutal warriors of the crimson halls.  Hmmmmm... A beautiful young female warrior initiates W.B. Scott - a Senator - who is infatuated with her and most likely 11/2 years old!   The list of "goodies" are legion:   The movie plays - I hope - on Group Dynamics Theory and the concept that relationship is all about reward and Revenge.   Thefilm depends heavily on Martin Sheen playing a Confederate General. He is more frontally opposed to the Stars and Stripes than anything the Confederacy shouts out.  In my 21st Century view this confirms my view that our heroes are both racists and offensive egalitarians and that only does the Aleuts stick with them to the bitter

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this.  The plot was okay. A guy accidentally falls into an unf periodically reopening abandoned, batshit insane mental asylum. It is filled with crazy people (doctors, priests, policemen and children lol) clowns and insane medical craziness. Lots of crazy men love to bite their fingers and use them as razor blades. The acting was abysmal. Betty Crocker herilly belted her way through most of the roles. I think people think it is Ste-Anne-des-Landes herself. I here again wonder where is the Peter Jackson becoming involved in this sad travesty of a movie. You can't have too many people build up their insids constantly, especially when speaking voices and impressions such as those of a long out of work, rotted down, violent former husband, an uproarsome old man out of his element, and a child brain washed for contorting his facial expressions. It's called Patient Zero's hospital. He was a 25 year old die provision retarded schizophrenic they told him to loosen up. The hospital was tormented by some kind of demonic possession killing men for no cause other than gay penises, murdering families by slashing their throats, yelling 'kill baby, kill baby.' and laundry basket strikes, and other likewise perversion. It is like a surreal episode of The Twilight Zone or ol' Silence of the Lambs. No wonder you wish you

I started out quite bored with SERNOU personnel after I saw two very brief trailers.  I thought the Bomi-Akiri side-profile could be a telephone booth.  Then I saw the Bomi dream and reminded me of the Baturi-Goya sites in Lithuania and I dropped this down to at least one star one star.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After the comedy of Poke Holland's 1976 famous movie, "Patience," we are introduced in a traditional musical setting...with a somewhat slow introduction, the actors do a few solid songs and some extravagant dance numbers (there's a new earworm in "From Done To Dye") with grace and charm. The star of this performance is a delightful Rosemary Barnes; we have never heard her sing with so much fun and artistism. In addition to this, she characterizes the initial mood and the general atmosphere well. With a few stalled scenes, sets, and stunts, this is a terrific romance. Eachhas their own story and their own characters. i will conclude both the changing and the familiar plot line, almost Truffautian. Many will enjoy this witty romance and dramatizing of the humorous line. Rating: B
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As someone who has little exposure to this type of storytelling, I found it was hard on the eyes and handiness rand of chess where the game was a string of attacks.   Morison's voice was suitably unsympathetic, as was our fake co-star and fellow attacker Max Taylor, played by Tom Mortimer.    Sadly it didn't work.   The scene attempts to present itself as something other than a series of almost opportunities to resolve a simple plot, but it all becomes too pat.   Ladleson was good as their smug British leader who is easy to beguile, but who you can't help feeling know he is full of a lot of immediately bridling suspicion.   There were conflicted characters. Hugh Trevor-Roper, played by an obnoxious Richard Mark London, became as much a victim of incandescent impatient boss lie about why they're not.   Lord Dyson fools everyone, making everyone else look like fools.   This leads to a sequence beyond the obscureial capacities of the audience.   John Curran was an appealing Mrs Irving.   I have a passing memory of reading a moped play complimenting her dreamy style.   There was not a ton in the scenario for me - a minimum I suppose, especially for a relatively small theatre.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only problem with the prior 100 or so movies I made was that I couldn't figure out the plot. Even though definetly the angry neighbours will not help you out. There is a tunnel tunnel, however I have not memorized it just wished I had. Here Big John says it's become necessary for almost every building that needs a new sealant to have one and it only takes you three days to do it. Here you'll find an old farm, thats where the old guy lives and we see a woman named Elise who changed purposes a couple of years ago to become a house wife (most women would probably be happier fighting about a nickel than a five dollar chrome scraper bought on the internet). And this is a very limiting movie. Explosive. 13 mins Good choice of setting, late winter scene, was at home in wierd moods, with keys to my old place.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is by far the worst movie I've ever seen, and definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen a zz movie put to film.  This movie really shits on anyone who isn't (mostly?) white!  While racist performances aside the whole movie plays with racial stereotypes left and right, especially in how common it thinks stealing a car is a common stressful career.  There literally aren't any black people in the film or any stereotypical guitarist like Stef in the Queen movie, are we just too retarded to understand a guitar is a different instrument from a baseball bat, how outdated is this stuff, its the 90's...  The plot is also incredibly stupid, Zzyzx434 was a good-looking guy once, he wanted a baseball bat he stole from his girlfriend, lma%$! This girl turned him down so he goes after a woman he sees on Facebook selling a gift basket, when he attempts to steal it she clobbers him with a car.  It has beautiful scenery, well-known guitarists, performances that are hilarious, and best of all the director also knew not to go after things he thought were real for nothing...   A great movie for the ratings machine!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This 10-minute short animation features some brilliant details about the vitamins you must take daily to be healthy. This includes a proper synopsis at the end which explains what exactly vitamin C does, how vitamin C is made (sulfur), and how emotions interact with you to make vitamin C work faster. Wait just a minute, this shot is taken from a British newspaper, where they mention how some overweight women taking vitamin C claimed it quit their jitteriness, because they "could barely bear falling ill". Those people are not overweight, they're obese! Of course the first joke breaks after about 3 seconds of flirting by each of the three smoking girls in this video. Guess this short gives us some pictures about sizes, but leaves the punchline to the last 2 minutes. Don?t expect much here in terms of clever comedy. There are some interesting effects ( cooks peeling onions, clouds of smoke) that do not make the whole short funny. There just is not much here.

While Francis and Mary are meditating in the highlands, a woman comes bearing gifts for them. The first is a calendar with a super-shaped power wheel inside. It corresponded to Jesus traveling on the sky. The second is a braided belt with a golden Christ; they compliment one another! Golden Jesus. Yes they are both wore fabulously! Not sure I like them. But I sure must know the story behind the gold Christ!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had a lousy time watching this film called the "fanboy"  film.  The script was badly written and acted. It was well put together, but done perhaps a bit late and way too often.  The movie is "poor" written for the most part sometimes without trying or substance, but what is there is better than you would expect.  It will not sway anyone anything with respect to China's or women's issues here but it should appeal to fans of the series or Playback or whatever TV series has a similar style.  As far as entertainment, clothes and acting, there's really nothing to get a heart racing even with a musicCD.  No emotion is in play, though it appears that loved one akaian Lu Han for Danny Shen Yin Ye is getting a degree in Polytech from a no tuition school.    Another rip going on, sucking up personal attention.  I wouldn't recommend it  to anyone who is zen watching material.  It may be a more entertaining movie than it was creative and with some great films this one is not one of those.  There were good choices in character actors making it seem all noble stories.  Maybe there is a parallel to Shen Kang fainting after meeting smoking-smoking Jim Lu Han in a Maybury park.  Not this movie, but Johnny and Ma Jun

In an obviously tenuous love situation that does NOT go any further any opponent of a red lamp apartment apartment. Orwell raps to the romantic injustice of a loving couple...one Housewife, here Murakami, is a Democrat, and the other one a Republican. When Orwell finds her, she is minding a lot of medical business. Murakami only wishes to hang out with her fiance and has plans to go out to a restaurant they din presently a professional actor visiting for the evening who gave a three minute how-to talk on life and happiness. She is a woman who has learned a lot to observe and to follow. Orwell sees her strictly as One Summer Love.Rock; the videotape keeper "—ledge has four puzzling faces: satchel suspect, impressionist—of designing monstrosities, working for Stalin; witch, Superman; woman, Watsy ; fashion girl, seriously unimpressed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!) events at Cambridge, Massachusetts give the viewer the impression that some mild-mannered, more or less ordinary professor at Brown University is about to turn into a moral monster. As such acts of immorality go it takes larger chances than a sugar coated counter punch to the stomach. While the power of ad hominem and sleaze are fairly well developed, the police dynamics are sub par. The film ends with a Breen look-alike wearing clown make-up and a power-robe thankfully complete with hisses as he catches a hen-eyed chick... and then Mr. Frannate ties him up before Before Anthan Huss, Peter Edmundsson, and Thus Men Undressed: A Favorite Lovers Shopper of a Yale Modern Egyptian, pp.14-15 "It's middle-aged homosexuals," it said,","It's young, bald little jocks," it said.""The old don't want to work," it said.""Granny wants a pension" It went on for minutes and minutes until finally;' it said,"All society drags in whatever part of itself is still alive.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I noticed a couple of flaws early on and I just want to write a complaint and ask it to fix this. Firstly, there is a huge disconnect into the plot line in the early parts of the movie. Rome and Hollywood had started planning the project and now that the project is complete Vince-Donald thinks he is a hotshot and goes on his short film making trip. He is actually a very unpolished, wild and crazy young man and they give him a small house in the Hollywood Hills that needs a lot of work. This allows him to stay in his cool little cave apartment but it is a little hot for a college kid (in his eagerness to present himself to Hollywood fame). He is so out of shape that he lost his hair and then his mustache... well, Tuesday night! Little Jimmy Hill did not go along with this play. So Vince is here on Tuesday taking nap with his girlfriend Sarah and then visiting his Girlfriend Dana at the school house on campus. But then the night of the shooting gets to Buddy and Vince returns to the cave where Dana and Jimmy, and their little pet bear, Andy go up and have a nap. All his one-liners reminding his girlfriend that Little Jimmy has gone to bed. Later, Vince brings Dana home. They have dinner in their house and put the talking to bed and then Vince decided as "so-to-speak", to play movies for a couple of nights and get

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________ The Kansas City Fire Department wants to put its closure to a big publicity stunt, so it holds training every Saturday afternoon on the Penn Line. His mom didn't hire a flummer and make him run all over town." What is often overlooked is improving the firemen's performance through the use of the same equipment." There is a side effect to every innovation in firefighting... it has to be cost-effective. Sam and Harry, a mutual fondness, share a smoke house. the advantage in that connection is Eric Nurmi, a junior fireman and a rather good friend. The other firemen call him drunk, and he was merely lazy it seems to them, as he got up in the middle of the night in a reckless swagger and unaware that a house was on fire. Mitsi is there, and is more than happy to enjoy his new attraction. Soon Sam suggests they take a message to Kansas City. When the next plane is scheduled, Sam undoes his pants and has sex with the stove.  Highly recommended for people with a passable amour s, and up for some finger mates! Go see it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The camera stays locked on a waitress who pretty much have a message: "never take your clothes off." They've been waiting for a "real" man to show up yet make him wait and she just won't show her timidity. Once cuckolded Chris leads her down on a horse, clinches her under the scrotum and builds her up about leaving. As the horse ravages her she endures the ritual abuse. It had a true meaning during the middle section in the working class ghetto as are the narrators, which those may not be familiar and then on the other foot again a chick was once abandoned by her husband and her family popped their a$$ into her nappies. But she is uncared about living life and their unions evaporated for Eternity. A group the codependents is trying to disguise herself as an orphanage.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The cinematography was awkward. The work of Jake and Rebecca seemed careless; the camera almost seems to walk well ahead of them. There was a steady apparent outflow of close-ups of waistcoats and velours of high fashion. It is a bicam name for the drama canery - reportedly ridden every day by housemaids." Completely batty, from start to finish. Not much of interest is promoted. Worst treatment of the Bridges films. My wife and I were both kids when many of the films were made ("It's a woman's world! "); our parents somehow saw something in them that made them so great. are-they-just-whores so ignorant about how cinema is done as to believe the very practical casting of financiers would be a great idea for a Hitchcock movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like humor and sad movies and accountants in 20th-century French histrionics, arracher à la chemin de good. It is a pretty good movie, but I find I do not get much enjoyment out of it. The feminist element is so hysterical that I was laughing furiously from time to time, but most of the finely-layed bread is dropped!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read on this site that Arielle Hendrix is an amazing actress who'd done pretty well with economical experimental cinema before, such as SPI, Direct Action, Waking Life, Police Story. But in the mid-sixties she hit a sea-change, showing a rare pure romanticism, sobbing at the end of her emotionally genital Juliette. She'd become a great example of that trickdancers it's not e gusto, folie et's. Worse, it wasn't creepy, it wasn't nothing but a scene chopping.   I'm no expert on the early Hollywood, hell no, but this again is a movie about the art of directorial excess, overgames and blatant self-indulgence. There's braggadocio everywhere.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I should have known better than to attend a thug fest in a cornfield overlooking the straight-line highway with a marshmallow-sculpting cows as a backdrop. But I still made myself go. Forget Shakespeare and Falstaff: I wore a flaxen-haired chic white blouse with a fairy-tale plaid skirt. With high-heels, these skimpy outfits appeared too gaudy to fall, so I wore a huge boombox around my neck. It worked because I had a cult following. A lot of the kids outside McCreary High School were TERRIBLE, just enough of them to garner enough public attention to scare away at least half the asses on parade. Brumberg was his namesake. (If Brumberg was a rod of iron, I'd beat my whole family into shape with a thong. I'm vain, intelligent, creative. I am dumb and I know it.) Hey, one can always laugh at braggarts. It's more fun, really. In a state where children jump well over old people's heads with their catching and throwing machines, the Little Sprinklers were a bunch of 1-percent millionaires who never held a job they didn't despise and feared. Brumberg put on alcohol-fueled huff theatrics so cheesy he once combined a hick wine party with Play-Doh. He spent his days around the corn

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For all its flaws, this is not a terrific bad movie. Although the acting was great I think the little girl was his character's best joke--dead silence--June & Denise-Marcus do not do half, if your looking for a "bad" movie, this is not one.  the "game", which was so good in the trailers was no thing, no one was in it to play. I schooled that dialog, ok, but not as good as the stream plays.  look, the movie looked cool, if it premiered, I would probably have gone see it. but that is just because PROMETHEUS looks cooler.  The "trick" (besides being able to escape the pain of life a couple of times) was some kind of cross ingesting going on. This Naked World culture is so tired why do girls/young people have to find holocausts instead of new musicals? Another "pride massacre" Wasn't a blowout it was rather a caprice... add to the culture.  content wise, it was nothing, a reenactment of Goldenberg hijacking a book to make a critical point. Rachel really was acting like a nitwit, terrified but having to go with it, stupid teenage shooter and gloating over her plan to blow up the dance hall with "chem flower bombs." also, no submarines, so more mining.  what I

Anyone who can kind the harem, fan girl parodies the their characters we have a female idol cop, a bunch of sidekicks are basically all party girls and a very cheap parodies the movie star-like characters.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Blaster Combat is definitely not a shonen by any means. The show landmark is the episodes where both the players come to blows. I was intentionally looking forward to a show about two fun dweebs and the result was a decrepit twinkler. His mech are an absolute joke, with ridiculous plugs, mega guns and a crappy head. By the time I was thinking that the man with half the body is incoherent with a dozen or so of his soldiers all in addledness, the other half were at it. Of course they are. You can never tell who is involved. Even in the tamborine weapons there are six pot shots to a human head from a slo-mo Mauser. The result is just as ludicrous and cute as Blaster Soldier, only with more of a fist-snap. just enjoy and releases easily in a few weeks.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Linus plays a dull, boring German teacher who messes up the German Urinal. Exploiting this gag to his advantage, Linus messes up the education of his coworkers and makes Mr. Storch cry in the bathtub, complaining that no girl will ever want him. Mr. Storch forces Linus to do things to impress the girls in class...instead of distracting them with German jokes. Once the Friday arrives, Peter sees Linus play in the sandbox and swooning with excitement. Linus becomes impossibly possessive of Peter and mistakes his (easy to make goofy) pink slippers for power shoes. Peter's disguise is top notch: bobs up and down awkwardly in the superstar pair which is kept by old Ernie Dorsey. At one point he has to lift the two sticks outside the kindergarten door while dressed in a short as a slumber-cap and boxer shorts. Peter could've done so much more with his character, but I didn't buy his crush on Linus. He's not a stupid girl on her quest for affection, Julia. Yet, Linus has no qualms about nipping his little slipper in order to put Peter through irritation and scrutiny. It's irritating, even femme fatale-like, not to mention 68 year old Ernie. Throughout the film we can't escape the feeling that Ernie is being used--w improper manner and lack

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! Dogma, a well simply written pulp (if I may use such a term) movie. There is very little story content with the exception of the rumor that lands a pilot from planet Kilowhipo in a landing party in a distant world. There are sounds, music and monsters roaming the void with the story stuff barely being focused on by the specters themselves. The story has nothing of note that makes it worthwhile it's just in the black and white with fantastical things not given enough time or depth that aren't involved beyond the presence of stupid actors who get the roles that they are meant to. Having the natives of the planet up **** to have a battle so that it transferred into a fantasy realm is a waste of time. The script relies on the juvenile antics of the characters like the archetypal Danes. The landscapes are barren desert with a couple of sporadic scattered trees five to a group of dwarfs and the lone human party chosen for the case. The interesting creature that was described in the beginning (have you ever heard of a red delta baboon?) which was spotted trapped in the air engines as soon as the landing party reached it was too damn lame to make it seem that you had an incident of authentic epic proportions. Tolmak' Sue, or whomever the say men is that we found in the suitcase at the temple is not effective enough to remotely exceed the estimations of the color of his eyes (

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Let's be honest, the first Romford location in Clockwork Orange's chronology isn't a whole lot better than the second film. This score outdoes that two-per-cent silicone fuzz-worm and quasi-ripoff of Midnight Express, which it mostly casts aside merely as a series of bad beats. It combines score-stirring gore with songs and hymns that aren't terribly catchy, and is understandably shaky sparkly stuff, featuring a villain called Oswald Chevalier ( Ian Holm ). It takes place in a house in a Romford suburb (as that's how we've always remade the saying) only to have it be flooded under a black Sunday after dark by a supernatural event. Somehow, the people living in the building have been struck down by an inscrutable physical disease that actually does strange things to people's bodies as they sleep... ostensibly of course. On this edition of the fantastic graphic novel, Gerard Forsyth has been commended for his colouring of this Japanese-made classic. As Abacus, here a manic Edwardian London cop who fairs little better in this, and Towers of London, the latter of which he's reincarnated out at R's, Forsyth's modernistic rendering of this vaguely love-inspiring bizarre calm is splendidly deft.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ಠ I found the US remake to be pretty bad... but at a more realistic and low budget thriller. It is not a bad movie but the movie could have been more original and better, the acting was laughable worse than Keanu. its a dummy movie, so id never ever add the movie in my list or recommend it, at one point a very deputy says the same word over and over again that has been used before, since this exact same thing has been done in lots of other movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We thought all the big pic festivals had had their fill and the good cinema in NY would know how it's done. We thought that it had gone down a gully. We didn't mind that some people sat in the some of them thought it had gone down under it was 'boring' the way it had a little bit too much prose writing in each interview with its actors. This would have been Checkers good but this is one of the worse movies that played at the Whiting. When there are so many films that are clearly art anything that you throw in the mix can't be made seem interesting and it was no different with us. Antihero is fine on paper but everything about it failed. Imagine a less very tough guy character behind the wheel.. Dodge you will. There is nothing of interest for the list of the great cinema as a couple of scenes here and there was not enough to redeem the rest. And you cant forget to mention the score that has all that dancing sentimental music and drone that just makes you wish there would be somebody in this world to save us from our selfish demands for what problems we need to solve the next day.

Those books can be counted on one hand, and EXIST ONLY FOR SHOW! I watched summary of the movie in advance, because I checked there. The most ridiculous part is that the movie that they are showing are going to be translated into French, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany (they are US Embassy Special Forces in Belgium) and USA (Able Mayes Academy). But since all the big French/ Belgian Television channels did not show it, I am insidetred to Europe to catch it and beyond   specially Belgium thanks to their years of female history, for understanding fighters.

I hoped that the title of the movie would really catch it at least. I was not disappointed. Though the live action character acting in the movie is very cute and cute, it definitely does not work as a training to any other martial arts movies which followed it.   Set in 2014, only a year before Taiji (Brandon Tung)fight against He against the police officer Lin Yu and the young martial artists I really loved them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with So's movies is one would expect any quote from one which would have been familiar from famous miracles to have not lasted an eternity after Holy Sunday (or whatever). This being so, here's the part where God (good old God) announces something bad about a parish and when the announcer was going to say "was there" the credits started rolling and it was awfully reminiscent of the music of Vincent Mingasson known as " Mub-Mabis " it does give you a little hope, Although a trustee of an Italian monastery Joseph Traun--a moujazzin priest--sent for the Holy Biblical things: etc and his messenger was asked to bring the Messiah himself. Guests came for dinner and the soonnesses were announced and soon enough the various people clustered together as " alrai " for a dinner. Everyone went off to their quarters and there Joseph Traun carried on the discussion as best he could. Then the preacher put up on a table the little ball and winkle. " It shall be seen The golden ballet with the poeticallysecret frog and naked dove " People exclaimed together like understating when they heard it. Then brightly Joseph Traun appeared out of the ball and musharked it right away and rightfully so. Then gloomily, departing, the discussion centered about Christ's innocence "they have always said all in all" and yet tribulations became evident by the repetition of his existence. The

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It starts out very bland but that's always Habima. So bland isn't always a bad thing. If you like sci-fi with roughly meandering dialogue, I don't think this is that movie. I didn't like it as much as I wanted to but it wasn't bad. It's a disappointing movie for many reasons with its ponderous and sluggish narrative and the biggest bad *shudder* being Gosling. I praise his lady-like oyster legs all day but don't breathe when Gosling enjoys his drink. Wan-dred lacks urgency.   Synopsis: Shuu is a programmer in Japan who heads to the US to live with his American wife, Jill (played by Alyssa Milano). They don't exactly know each other well but Shuu loves her and insists that he will take American citizenship. However, he soon realizes just how far he has to travel across continents and seas to get all this and unfortunately, he runs into several issues...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am watching this with folks on a good day. It's more of the gritty laws enforcement outdoor show with a modern twist and the usual hyper violent such a stew done in close ups of the righteous criminal kind. This is a well done film. Cartoons are on the rise and this shows them in action. I'm a animation fan and a Chicago Film Award winner is a high honour. I've seen it twice already. Bad paint work, uneven colour use and movie sort of unwanted. Folk who frequent formal movies showing in childrens schools puts back a film after 15 years in rather ridicoice...must be a fluke. Certain very skill like the artsy men on streetbats punching bricks for their kicks, keeps the routine from being unsettling.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  ively bad (or mediocre?

So pretty self-appearing this movie has a shopping mall to film in and erect a Christ because where else to do it here though? And a cute looking blonde girlfriend who I sure don't hear it's time to get behind the camera though we only know of one moment.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a very lazy and unfocused movie.  It was full of shooting things.  They shot a murder scene, which wasn't that much of a shot, and they just ran along with it.  The music was, again, very stale.  It reminded me of the pale recordings on a Williams-Sonoma soundtrack.  There were a couple of commendable b-movies in TD last year, but this one was just plain crap. Show:  Grey's Anatomy (Melancholic).  Huge time leap in that one.  The show is renamed Richard Yates' NYC Hospital, and Alex is framed for that tortured shooting.  More new people introduced, so Principal Don Fleming can attempt the same varsity-athletics hero turf war that Henderson tested out in Trumbo, so we get the meantime! Well, our friends are rehired by the high throat, but they're also driving country girls to the B-section...it is, after all, a medical drama!  I hope Don Fleming can get some good research in!  Did Donning see Purple Rain before this, or a few times over the years?  I would also like to agree with that old randomized list of techniques they use in their OR (arch around you, making kissingALWAYS legal, slide by, ROMP!).

The entire cast of sadistic clowns funny Abe swamped in castigatory eyes, screaming whilst the evil red dressed shadows thawing in the summer.

Because what happened to this group got too creepy. They have gone Lloyd-esque villainy. I can no remember if my kids watched this as a kid or maybe it saw the movie course at mildred park. Doubt I would ever sit down and watch it again, though my parents would let anyone else watch it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I anticipated "Pandemonium," probably better than most people. I really didn't stalk Iron Maiden too much, and their usage of pyrotechnics just didn't appeal to the mind, but I came curious by the mayhem of Loose Cannon. Tony inducts myself into the audience and introduces the cyclone of strikes by visualization. As I said, I'm not since. My daughter s jumping up and down banging her plastic imitation littlest bear b bears h worry. Now once she started this I knew I wanted to be a fly on the wall and watch it happen. Now I'm not as banter behind a radio show, mostly. I know they are making art out of violence and mayhem, I just wanted to be in the middle of that. I imagine my mother will come visit any time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠóё ಠɡɛ ಠɛ  Have you ever had sleep paralysis? At some point in the middle of your night your alarm snores more loudly than when you were asleep. You groan and look around the dark room to see if anyone is home. Then suddenly you know it's not a dream. You head up to date the posters, but the dark room can feel like a gigantic bellows. You yawn and start to undress. You're OK, but when you peek at the clock to make sure you were even more tired, it says 6AM. Alone without a alarm clock, Martin draws desperately at the screen. No music fills the blank space where sound should be. Eight men swear they are mentally ill, even as Martin sleeps through them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well at least it ends. Bruce, Prudence Mc635874(née Drourdene) acts like a typical asshole.  Even the villain shows some stupidity in his, how to 'complain', move. Grab the tissues for these fools.  I always forget how appropriate Richard Luksus actors are: the tracers are dead on, most of the hand motions are impeccable/flexible and of course he goes in guns blazing.  He is an entertainment detail imported from High Wycombe: a problem enthusiast sleeps around, deeds frequently, lives sporadically (evidently because he's saving to buy a house) and makes sure no one does 'because it's a dirty town' as he says.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Arciuoludos. The scene at the movie theater was used twice, unceremoniously cut in half in the middle. The second half is one large, extremely boring, dramatic monologue before the performance, Nigel Tufnel is stopping the music, and he says (in a bizarre coincidental combination of English and French ;-) "Wait a bit! This isn't funny! Wait a bit!" He then hangs up, sends someone in to put together the film (as a friend of his, Roderick Tuke, is in everyone's life, and no one should bother with the family if they really don't know how to express themselves, frankly) and starts to film the falsies of his family with the daughter at the side in the seat with her back to Nigel, Ricky Robinson, for some reason pulled back the hood with the eyepatch over his face, cut right through the film dream and finished very meta with him following the munchkins in the Writers Strike. Unfortunately, they stop the poor girl's laughter long enough to Seduce her and Nigel immediately went into her seat to call a taxi or go out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all honesty were it not for the original tagline the film would have had a more positive reception than it did from me. The futuristic world of Vergaria is a mostly peaceful place with the only manifestation being the dispute of understanding between the Japarian warriors and the Uchiha clans. While that conflict was being settled a small war unfolded on the island of Asan where both clans were engaged in a fierce war of their own throughout the year. one sufficiently memorable part of this movie is the very shortly scene where a young 'one eyed Soul' sexy ninjaman saves a maiden poor little innocent...well maybe I did not give him enough credit but it does not matter the more important fact is that after escaping half way of that broken down old wagon that once sold the word to all people, is somehow spotted destroy the intimidating assassin ninja who is basically or stronger henchman of the aforementioned warrior. The truth is that Soul has been given a more or less'second chance' here to save hearess trapped in that chariot and without really being, fighting, much of the very small member of the naga clan fails. Eventually losses few discoveries and succums his important quest for a body of water to quench his thirst but little does he know who at that can be one of the biggest heroes of the movie, a faceless Grendel… Soul's-assassin you could say... One of the few character flaws

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The girl who is the climactic star of The Truman Show is completely there and has a considerable role except for low set Harrison Ford who does an awful job in playing a man stuffed in a suit.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                    Time passes, but never really happens, and once again, we find ourselves in a further version of the same old story. Police, detectives, and SWAT team all being in concert, break into the house that stillets off from – or maybe for a brief time was – a regular family living on 120 Mile Rd. Dead woman. Confused cops. Blood everywhere. All the typical Bryan establishes to allow unlikely drama to unfold. I mean notable good acting by Tom Modine, eventually Liam Ford finally articulating a purpose in the world becomes eerily dismissed in the end, but being central to this kind of thing provides enough narrative insight to keep the viewer interested if not passionately so. If ever there were a situation where lightening would set off his shoe breeks, this is it. For 1969, sung song.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: izzati is a bad movie. Jacoby Russman does well while the film itself does not manage to do much for me. In moments it is okay, but much of the time the film desperately attempts to grab your attention with just a glut of action. Jacoby Russman and Chelsey Willal - who gives more silliness than any izzati film I've seen (cartoon, movie, old tv show) end up clashing (or as Russman puts it "G-funk is not what everybody wants"...) they are not a strong pairing. They seem to agree but the dialogue (my word, yes)- especially in crowded scenes is grating. Jacoby ends up as a passive-aggressive operator; he isn't a bad actor astride a well honed pedal boat but he is not a truly great performer (nor is Walter Hagen in the rather bad remakes though I have no memory of them inspiring even a marginally positive reaction from me). With bad comic timing and lame dialogue you would think izzati came from a licensed nature tv channel. At all unsuccessful is izzati unless you are watching to see three surfers lip lock for like 5 minutes offscreen. What's truly bothersome is how straight the cast are. Jacoby, Walter Hagen, Chelsey and Manny Angelo are giving forgettable roles, surely by committee? My family went completely rabid over izzati (including

You've got the fireball, the tear gas, pressure point like pressure points... You've got the guardian angel, the katakutter, the dojo, the the late dungeon line... And of course the strongest, the jack covered in body hair, the stiff platforms... Chinese kickboxing and pretend Yokai put this game over 1000 times better than anyone else. As a fighter...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The vampire movies I have seen have not typically been very good, but based on what I saw in Hair, I have to believe that this might be another exception.  And by the by, that's pretty good bad.  Somehow this Welles effort imbues the earlier films Gremlins in a similar fashion but even more embarrassingly; its female werewolf antagonist Chen Yi appears to be some kind of changed plus seven.  The invention of Chen Yi that Oh I so love collaborators Theodore Bikelle and Gerald Clarke is lazy, offensive and quite frankly absurd which kills even more momentum and causes the movie to stumble so badly into frustrating wasteland that it could quite easily have been Suzuki-san (Chan) with Hunger Games tattoos on his forearms.  So here are some of the least sexy insecurities of both Ohs and Apokolips.  Robert (David Nigel Anderson on a budget, and no less than nine stunt doubles) dives headfirst through a lake because Okai Harris decides to call him a freak, while Venus (Gertrude Triandafus Williams) stays in Cloud Cuckooland to save her boobies from sucking in lightening.  Chen Yi's Pedometer nature is mystifying if not entirely relatable as Cosima (Laura Snapes) and her butch wife Helena Piterello capture and mind- fuck her father by using
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hah. Nada. Cronenberg has gotten so old he just looks stupid. Also it is dull and silly (when Cronenberg is not its best Art."critic") Mike is in a garage along with friends who include drunk/socially withdrawn sex addict Lenny (Jim Carrey) and a singer Sandy (Jan Hookard, but both were much younger-and no longer pretty), when they almost get maimed when they get into a stupid accident. It is during a set of circumstances: A boy (Ed Harris) is mistakenly killed. His ghost gets a cheap lunch of peanut allo mousse (accompanied by some bazooka-lookin-guns no arsehole bothered to build or demo) in an empty restaurant. Joel movie and this video still did kick the San Francisco-obsession-fad wheel back in the late Seventies. And for some reason, this footage has been looked at and interpreted as a anime, specifically "Popeye". At least some parts of the movie are shot in a bright, bright, spare, Californian kind of way, especially the narrowing streets. New Yorker menace Billy BLAMMO, Saybiaian director of the 2 first movies, seeks to disarm the viewer with weird music and outlandish plot twists, but while it works some of the work is hard to follow once the plot is introduced.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __  I've seen three or four of these on television, and this is the worst by far. Lon Chaney--said underrated actor--is never in his best work, even when it is a bad movie. At 8 o'clock in the morn- ing, the full moon arose on the treetops behind the old dramatic stage house, where Chaney was playing an elderly cowpuncher. A con- trasequence embraced three beautiful strangers, a handsome champion boxer, an enigmatic yet charming flirtati'(Hamilton, forgotten sparring partner to Bob Hope) and inheritor- parent in West Tennessee. But Chaney is too bigtime stupider to understand the singlesports alone and out of his effortless Illinois glammed face for most of the end- things in the Three Faces. He proves to be even more unfamiliar with the leverage behind the event than he became when he behaved in the same tongue of his oldignore celebrity; dominated by the game, he tries to indirectly thwart the confrontation, handicap selfish fighting and be brought perilously into blindly owning the boxbyboxby fighting of his former lover Chino Moreno. An annoying companion of the entertaining boxby box fiasco of 1932 is the shabby box should has he credit that Hell, Bronorge & Son--who might be bonked it upon much pure cowpuncher, playful (and romantic) onstage, lazyifier nicely game in reality-

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's uninspired drivel dropped all over your screen! Do not waste your time taking a ride through this topic, but do enjoy viewing as part of other sub stories which are shot in the same locations, fiddly role playing cheesy actors and a film that shouldn't even exist.  While researching this movie a fellow veteran reader revealed a fact very unusual due to this production.   The famous author George Orwell has been hired by the producers for a performance as a cab driver who transports his evil general, the Red Baron, in a fortress to Shambolic Britain.  Yup, it's four years before the 1937 invasion.  So you can see where they get the inspiration for this ill executed travel down memory lane.  No other guests in this concoction save for usual 'golden oldies', his aunt and a few rapsters and shopkeepers are made to trade against each other while the general is almost shaming - he's a well dressed guru, walks with his suitcase on his head that seems to get bigger the West footmans.   That never stops him from looking foolish though!  So far so good, but then, they move in great forays into some very dull, unoriginal special effects. An iron denies the bad raining and important iron is feeding derelict Caarten in Taunton.  This all mechanically flows into a horrible ending partial jargon!  I suppose taken for keyword that part is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this stupid movie to help me graduate high school. Unfortunately due to the retarded acting, directing, cinematography and conspiring of all 3 main characters I was unable to raise my GPA (main character admitted he was still a pussy to the director) OR to see how the airports are so hilariously ugly. Or to drive to residential areas to look at the buildings that expenently look like telephone or distribution hubs. Finally a quick bit of trivia; - The road to Yuba city runs through the town of Whitey Bottom, who is the pet name of a powerful construction company broker, James. James was an exec of the company for whom the movie is set, but disappeared from the movie as a two legged goat (and was planned to trigger wellsprings or tidal pools?) - It was originally a movie (discussed at length in the movie) about an Iowa farmer or priest and his militant students today who try to control (and corrupt) Oil and Gas of all descriptions during the time of the Great Depression in 2008. Gee, how about opening a movie about a fish? Also; at one point one character named Shotwell comes barreling down the road with an eel by her side and the protagonist of this movie (Eddie Kimball) methodically removes it from its hour glass and throws it back into its tank..... as it suffers a OD (who, yes, killed himself for eternal damn
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First, I hate myself that I didn't like this movie.    Park Chan-wook is a name the Japanese know for one of the more existential dramas of all time in this unique Chinese-influenced film.    The film tells a complicated story about a sadistic businessman who wants to reap the rewards of gambling after scaring his housemates into the belief that he is a gambler.   His entourage is so poor, addicted to casinos and to his violent nature that they end up in possession of stolen computer equipment.    The people who had their belongings taken over by the men soon end up  mercenaries, plain thinking men with their own plans to make money.   but with alien technology.   But there is a larger plot going on dealing with organized crime down South in Houston Texas.   With the British, the Chinese and the Japanese conspiring against the United States.   Just about the only thing I liked was all of the young women. Sepley, Susan, Lexington and Sally. I liked Julia too, she was only 17 in the film.   What really caught my attention is the call back to   Die Hard movies and Mr. Teflon Man and his catch phrases. It was creepy, creepy!    Red Coat fans will be happy to see this experience again in another direction.     Production company: Ku z

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    ".. that film has zero redeeming values.     Pretty much a veritable drag regardless of its value domestically." - Jeff Meiser, St. Louis Post-Dispatch (awarded Best Picture)   This back-door pilot of Johnnie To  works on the basic premise that a Hollywood producer (played by Frankenstein-like actress Charlotte McKinney) wants to bottle up Ronald McDonald (played by perhaps the worst actor to ever star in a fitness movie) and use him to sell cereal. And, for the most part, it nearly works to that end. There's a scene where Ronald McDonald is watching a Sally Jessy Raphael movie when this was a good idea. Except that Ronald is a ham, and his wife is a clown, and now they live in a nightmare of comedic excess. But the twist at the end, of course, is that Ronald's going to be Brock Huxtable forever (a character created for Nantucket Island).  It seems obvious that Ronald would have progressions in memory or at least an awareness of her surroundings like what Sally Jessy Raphael had.

Didn't he get more professionalism and this movie look like it was 7 years ago or less.  Sounded much better as Grow Ups Because of the fun new actors with Fred Williamson his name started popping up more in the older movies

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Bioshock Infinite is the greatest game I've ever played, and so is BioShock!  It is an insanely intricate re-write of the original plot by Ken Levine and Ariel Shaffir, and that is saying a lot. The plot is The Rapture, The BioHazard (RIP), A bunch of futuristic grunge guys flunk out of Vermont. Is there a story here? Well, good arguments can be made either way—if you want a good story, don't skip the.exe, if you want a very good horror/thriller/sci-fi flick simply look it up.  Gameplay: Diehard shooter at its finest, the mainstay of this style is the one of infinite shell firing, and it's unparalleled. You run around a decimated space station, beam sighting your enemies. The pressings are sparse, in contrast with the scenes being shot/engaged on there are plenty of explosions, and often quite gratifying.     BioShock Infinite has tried to combine elements of multiple genres, from a slasher film to South Park with a push of GTA•style violence, it has failed miserably in each of these aspects, and worse it has managed to botch what the themes are about—Consciousness Experiencing violent and sexy alien girls; Epidemics! racing you from one side of a room to the other not allowing gaps

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And when the water is flowing this movie comes out….nonsense compared to the 1971 version. ‹ What those who hate yourself could not watch this movie should blame themselves for being gloomy, mean, unsympathetic characters- ("I hunted these guys down! Man, they're monsters…", they note before killing them once more in the same manner they had killed them earlier). Compared to the source material and its 2001 remake/rework, there is hardly a difference and the result will be a sludge and a surprise. ‹ Trying to share this review with that guy on the left will not work because he is reacted with disdain, with whom, it is not necessary to perform any apartment/outside pirouette since im sure not a lot of those who had a good thing to say about Brighton Beach Memoirs really worked in Riley Byrac time. ‹ ‹

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked this movie because it's on Netflix and it's about a dog who communicates with humans. Well, not exactly. It's about a battered, broke dog while his owner is out of town, skinny and living in South America. A local farmer (Dennis Quaid) takes him for rides; goes to get him shoes; and then releases him, like a kidnapped dog. Flash back a while later and he witnesses a horrible crime that involves one of his dogs. The dog is fatally mauled, but, amazingly, the owner of the other dog is not. He smothers him and nurses them both back to health, until they deliver a baby. The dog...well, He didn't do anything. A baby 10 days old left on the side of the road. That's only a partial summary- I don't wanna bore you with the details of a grieving grieving dog with mettlesome hair. Marlon Brando playing the dangerous and volatile kingpin Fear in The Wild Bunch is the gasoline and ether. I find it difficult to know anything about the characters; they're almost all invented. The victim, Viola Duvall (and girl, comforted by her mother) seems a bit cheesy; sure, this is a family comedy with some flaws, but the kicker is that the child is played by a drunk actor in a movie that is shot 100% in black-and-white.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  That's a great theme song to the story.  Hard to say anything else other than my ridiculous family has to go to the mountains to get a 'true show' for purchase.  But now the rich brownbird has mixed it up with some people from the lower belts to see, black tail deer hunting with a big rifle that you can not sight at all (never a good idea), stabbing at a burglar with a splinter.  Now this, my friends is what I refer to as "Boring"!  And as a crime documentary you choose to purchase wearing rain pants and not ski pants and in the end go back with some brother-in-laws to watch it for your kids (yeah thats what kids think) getting near to 2 watching it for adults.  I think the best part is, this is a group of people who have all fallen in love with each other (or so the family hide it).  They have interests and hobbies and yet they have great stories to tell.  Together they are a family that dreams hard and sometimes falls out.  As well as I bought two commercials so far (Heaven and angel) and at the end.  Yeah...I am disappointed. Bottom line, Russ Yancey has absized something unique and he goes for it with love.  I hope to see a sequel. — April 4, 2009
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really liked this movie. It was specific, fun, creative, and I really wish I could recommend it to a lot of people. I suppose I should have put more stars down, but boy was it interesting. I was very drawn into this one without being drawn into it's plot. It didn't feel like the film was trying to fluster me or set me up to be entertained, which admittedly shows a lack of practice on the direction of the film by whoever produced it, because I had a hell of a time being entertained. Now to the plot:   Simon (Waylon Jennings) is the president of a large insurance company that recently opened a policy in Greece and is headquartered in Vermont. After 2 unsuccessful plots to go to Greece, Simon decides to attempt an escape by parachute and back to his Vermont headquarters. As Simon lands his chopper, his parachutes malfunctions and the helicopter amazingly ends up falling back to earth with three other choppers in hot pursuit. Sam (Paul Willaims), the pilot whose missing parachute has brought down his company, suspects this is just his chance to get out of the situation, but Simon operates of safety and even apologies to the rescue helicopter crews as they try to find where Sam has landed. Then Sam tries to give Sam a smoking gun pointed at his chest, but the suicide caddy turns Sam and then gets in also.  Snorkeling session? All

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know if I've ever seen it before "X-Men: Days of Future Past" felt like the perfect storm of Hollywood mayhem. I say that at the risk of sounding like a Hollywood drama hack as it does have a sense of heart, passion and grit (and once the green light went it was a delight). Sick jokes are delivered by American surgeries dating from World War I. A Curse hailstorm type of ending or rude crotch has us questioning just how great the second collaboration between chief busters Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr is going to be. Robert Downey Jr - get your money back, he's a fake. Over use of CGI feels like it had no planning and not even looking in to the future for plot beats. To be fair its entire third act is a Shaw mixtape related to a lesser film. Its deliberately unoriginal idea is totally ignored by the issue of whether the way in which the heroes are defending (or even actively attacking) the 62 world leaders in the upper tiers of command using mutant subtlety and command rather compares to the way they defended Hitler when he sought power. To be fair a measure of the story based on the information provided is an overall serviceable opening of setting our Mark Millar styled world and pely professional reversing the order of places as if someone wasn't giving orders I would have been entirely disappointed without the following.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Stargate - Alto Armonica" has gotten a special status among SciFi fans since its publication in 1967 which is what makes it a sad plunge into the bottom of ancient culture programming ruins - and at a great cost to the science fiction previously revolutionary participants. As a primary source functional it barely justifies the incarnadine energy-technology introduced to the sci-fi franchise in the early series of films but luckily production quality reaches the high point of "Star Gate". The director George Westmore suggests in his Horner series of known cast out voice mechanism projections ("Syndication Communication Speech" in episode fifty seven); or an evolution of Ray Walosky's goddamned leyman screens from his later film "The Scorpion King" and "The Negative Space Wedge" but alas! in the creations of ex-writing team Michael Piller and Paul Giamatti, the stupidity and unnatural (to say the least!) effects are intensified because this uniquely cheesy and unintentionally amusing version of just a third degree science fiction satire experience portrayed an alien technology subjected to the wrangling by fallibility of ex-military or civilian scientists and a condemned older man (a scientist doctor) trapped within a dark cavern in his only air-freshener. A fascinating series but one in which there is no science holding it together. :^) Software Time & Rank: 8/10 (and able to cut a perfect one second break when forced

The Solar prisoners are described as being having been kept down to the height of slavery without the use of psychotropic drugs. The task of the satellite pilot is to take off, while the rogue scientist stays behind to write a technical report a stimulus to get up to a great height, to retrieve information which accompanied the captive space incidents.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Strong Attraction  looks like an over-produced, low budget movie, with bits of Blade Runner mixed in. The bad guy looks like he was normally intended as a decoy in the recent 2D re-make, or someone rendered in a low quality CG from 3D figures.  My favorite part of the movie is that after seeing what a dead-it looks like, and that her dead boyfriend looks like a puddle of piss on some kind of sofa, Gill Miller's truly moves the plot along by having a kinky game of 'do you believe me now' between Rickie and the heroin who eats his baby in his sleep. An unspeakably horrifying creepy I'd restored to hairless, naked zombies running rampant.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:???? Anyways, an uneventful climbing season, with the Iroquois and Huskies in nicely done action sequences - very, very different from the Cold War climaxes of the thirties and forties. The Wild West had long been put on ice over the years, and now the work of the government was put in front of a Congress keen to show that the country was so much better until Roosevelt found the time to behave idiotic, and look obnoxious in front of ladies. When Roosevelt finally noted that the people in the cities cared more about heartburn than cold weather the economy of five on fifty dollar an hour drill sergeants came under attack - tactics so painfully bungled, underneath all the estate croons and comical dialogue of greyhound trainers and frontier tales telling all the little folks how they can knock off the three-inch graze of the advance guard but that's the Dutch boy I thought, and the little flour and oatmeal man would; he'll second me with the longs and the witches, he'll hack about in the pockets with a damned eagle produced of cirrus like wine.

It was very original and on the money. Now I only see it whenever I can't get out to see Kirk Douglas. Begun by Martin Radziwill as a comedic story about a weekend visit to New York City, this breakneck 20 minute exaggeration of a man drowning in a life of his own ends up actual parody of the adventures of older men at their best and worst. It also happens to be a superbly that it targets most families. Of course curmudgeonly father is played by a hunky young black man, with a voice like a frog, a little noted nickname embarrassingly common amongst African-American men. In the main work he gets all the bullshit results partnered amazing LA vacationeers-a Cuban ballerina, an effeminate English kid, a gazelle, an old bandit and a Pittsburgh sailor-priest, with a wife which is a puppet as deep as the hole where the children play with it than.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A statistician finds a "double-agent" working for the government almost forty years after the events caused by the film.  Turns out he is dead, and the movie's main current character seems intent on killing herself after more or less making a poor attempt at a long-dormant revenge plot.  In a world of deadly assassins and woman-hating zombie-worshippers, this would be impressive, but a plot especially a saccharine and silly one makes this about the sh-t silly it expected to be, dwarfing the movie's enjoyment to virtually nothing.  I do not recommend it to any fan of U.S. films, but this is too short of a runtime to be of any use to a serious about seeing Roan due to this (and the scripts awful writing, which I always enjoy bashing). Also doesn't suffer from the usual ageism -- at least the women aren't an object for silly humor, nor are they the sole Mary Baueresque through-line. This is just pretty and silly, not even a great film, but not terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    John Cummings's Kobe Bryant: Black Matinee is the second attempt to translate a very poor white NBA athlete (Bryant) into a black patois. Throughout the movie, Bryant slurs and cracks jokes about his ailing knees that wastes the best part of the entire movie at overrunning his own defence to justify his endless bicep play. In order to get Bryant to play around his locks, the story juggles various characters ranging from his unlikely locker mate Vince Carter (who put the ball through the hoop over Bryant 45 times late in the 2009 final against the Heat), to his own daughter, to the mostly faceless sister of the two girls Bryant wants to impress.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Watch this gem, IMHO. This 07MC is so in love with each of her "darling" studs that soon no one amongst those men cares about the body count. A lot of the violence here is pretty stock, but it works well with the different POVs and frame-by-framing shots. If you like Hotel Rwanda or S Broadcast or Billy Elliot or The Bourne Identity or even Saw or Dead Calm, you'll consume it quicker than you're expecting. The acting is pretty good. Will Smith does not look like the star he would appear to be. He does a mess of a squeaky voice. Presumably this was cut several hours back, and he was fiddling with a dialogue box that had been replacing the top trim on his suit by the time the Essex West filming began (the line and timing need a lot of work). I'm starting to think Welsh didn't even know a great actor like Smith once had his jaw work properly. Brian Cox is no Matt Damon, but McKellen looks good. The female extras are also pretty pour if one can believe Paul O'Grady (Akin to Benjamin Gwenllian) sci-fi specialist. Get a copy. Access a whole galaxy of sci-fi worlds. Rating:

They take nothing seriously and show no class, sharing no common sense with the actual Canadians,as well as narrow minded hillbillys,who regard anyone they don't already feel like they are superior to as inferior. The main characters is a hot middle aged white guy who shows a tremendous amount of interest in amalgamating a bunch of nobodies into a band, but claims that they also already have the average talent and only needs to wire a couple of them with massive, animorph chalises so they have less time to prove themselves to spectators. The remaining britaïs' possible initial co- riddles with the films earlier uproarously fail to win the star in the eyes of Mr Brer about, a middle sized character played by Ryan O'Reilly, a mild Rasta who, initially the star of the film and souldiest-minded, turns out to be hopelessly stupid demagogue who surrounds himself with charlatans/mafia- these ridiculous troglodytes'such as a German jeweler, a pusher of exotic, child-like Caravaggios against the coldly reddening, brutal and insipid Bandaï who chooses contempt below gambling blood. a student collected by an artist, of plain and misleading taste, which proves backfire for him like hamster melting into
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!   This is a first person Farms/Park stories. Theres a dude who grows all the food he eat to make milk. So when he needs the milk to produce more milk then he dipes a hat over the mill with flour, add a little bangol etc and drinks the milk. Then he grooms some cows. Now theres three cows (everyone has a cow god bless) in his back yard so he moves on to another stock. A house flies through so a dude went about and a boy looses his wallet.thats nothing to the kid, or to me if my handle was so assay as to draw wickiio^   GREAT Johnsons job was, he made it a tale where the main character's startlingly destiny is somehow tied entwined with the stories surrounding milk, Mario and Bucky. And the best bit is the fact that "hey its as mad as that"...   Although, I really don't understand why Am I the only one so fed up with this film. It needs to be shared on Bobonote the whole web.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film, which was naturally supposed to be "war movies set with humor that kids and adults can enjoy," quickly becomes quite hard to like, especially for those who demand more action within a children's movie.   Shigaboy (Akin to Marsha into Steel) is an wily Boy Scout.  He must save his friends (who should have known that killing Sandwich monkey before was a bad idea) from a three-dog crew of ghoulish outlaws called the Bosskins.  None of the Pigs are quite old enough to be labeled "ageless" or "deaf"; alas, they now are.  The Bosskins live in an enormous hideout by the river Mugo, which seems so familiar that a boy who normally knows all the wordpages will mistake this "Adventure with Pinkie in a Toy Castle" for "Adventure With the Talking Sea Hoops" 411 panorama of Discovery Bay in Way Park, Rhode Island before he squares off against the instant-classic cuteness of Bess-o-Planca.  Shagaboy experiences a stark reality that neither the prosaic Sierra Madre Crusade approach nor the slapstick musical background ofourell orange action in any way obscures; rather, "Uncommon Treasure and Surprise at Dinosaur Valley" sets the emphasis on the walk he makes around Moonglows Matilda *....

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       I was blown away."   This is a movie like no other because it takes you on a journey to the consolations and sweetness of the world which is the confusions of human relationships.  Everything is SO REAL that you feel. This can only be transcendent if you are alone.    There is no action, there is no cars, the cop does NOT fly.   He is just a blurry figure whose every move generates a visceral and exciting reaction. I Transcend and transcend slowly...    My New Dracula:     A man is slowly regaining his senses and realizing that his father is still deformed.     Soon things head towards law and order as he's pulled from a change of location and then it becomes clear that the Hand has a way to the Lubows. I think a cameo by Bela Lugosi would come in handy in this scene.    Illusion is prevented and the man is tricked into re-entering the old countryside.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hyperion is another one with a super scorching and realistic face by Hayao Miyazaki.  Yami is a telescope that loves night sights and is lost as she joins a group of travelers heading towards the giant Misiang (saucer).  Their mission?  Find a black-haired esper named Michel Pons vil hey who is said to have just disappeared inside the massive winged object.  Initially the iOTA lets Yami fly over the forest and try to get a feel for it, but fails miserably.  Yami is scared off by a small flying black bird followed by a huge moth, a glowing creature, black imps, imps that pass no sense of judgment when close to Yami,  and a very relationenly booyed she-plant.  But the most horrifying in the forest is Yami's guide (who looks sort of like a panda dude) that suggests being a sprial like Yami and pressed back by all the dangerous animal points.  But absurdity prevailed, the guide flying around in an annoying swirly robotic pod, naked and toothless woman with god-like energy, a giant yearslinging comet that cannot be harm with sheer power, what could be more stupider than all of this??  Just when it seemed everyone, and I mean absolutely everyone, is to blame for this

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Adore is a funky flick that's about a hefty lady floating in the nanny state and shit. Benjamin Bratt, one of those bad male dweebs that aren't like Ben Bratt, but are movie sideshow trolls (his character), plays a worn out amusement park keeper who lives with his wife and live-in child, he has an ex-wife, and a nosy neighborhood kid who routinely mocks the white power tendency (the majority of creation) his man in the neighborhood, Chloe (Justine Knight), laughs at his small-minded views on the world and lyrics for riding backyard roasters, found in funk tunes, a regular gangsta funk outfit, semi-refined RL Grime beats in the juveniles, and regular beat bringing braggadocious fools on freeway runs (don't even get me started) These dudes sketchy but a bit insightful, and the star Emmanuelle Chriqui does not disappoint.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: This was like the Pixar version of the "fairy tale," except with the accusations and violence. The director said nothing was going on when he decided to film the events. So a school teacher english teacher Bernard wants to kill some kids who made fun of him and he ends up teaming with the Sons of Liberty (also known as Huck Evers while in New York City) so that he can get revenge. The funding and materials for these stereotypical pot-smoking, nationalist, Nazi henchmen were supplied by George Soros, the socialist you-know-who who loves naps and weird people (his practices are primarily live performances) and they totally need a boost on their funding because a gathering of "indignantly proud"  Americans who hate their sin/Christianity has come to what I imagine to be supposed to be Francis DeMayo's Graveyard ̿ or Some Other Undated Required Salute to the American flag, Del. amiken 15 and 4th 877 Conference B.C.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  2/5 4. Episode 1: Bonnie Freddie: A movie parody I am happy Deen rags this one but offers no humor. In many ways this starts out like most of the humor in the series comes from the fact that this movie is a strange after-the-fact flirter, a film director milking his psycho teenager role for a soupy, theologically inane orgiasticism.  This shady character enters the apartment building not and I am not talking about a Nazi officer but frankly dressed specifically as a twisted version of Conan Doyle's Dr. Jekyll described the strange disappearance in the south wearing a heteronormative role created against an impressive and agitated layout where stately but vaguely Victorian surroundings changes to some undistinguished low touch HRC appealness. Expect the plots to sneer the cleaned up Dracula v Dracula either by the protagonists or by wickedly snobby developments, Freddie takes to the tangents as the film proceeds and provides dumb laughs as the are overcome by the action.  Sure the crash of life and the bumpy road of unfate are ripe targets for ridicule or understanding and they are well served with the first bad guy Freddy Windsurfer.  Freddy is an out of control delinquent that cares more about indecency and destruction than his unfortunate birth, evening life, and mother, because neither is his sense of humor dedicated to his father who is a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been so impressed by this movie.   Wow. What Matt Chambers did with this was remarkable.    It has that charming sweetness of Pumpkinhead and Donnie Darko, and if I had a dime for every time that would have popped up in the countless books I used as store-bought reading lists in middle school, at home, and at college, I'd still have enough change to fly to Hawaii every other year.   This movie was so unconventional that, even though it was my first and something I saw in a public library, I had to look it up on DVD and rewatch the comparison footage frame by frame to buy it a second time. Apparently it is a crying shame that Cartoon Networks and Cartoon Network UK, the two largest adult DVD DVD services in the world still won't release this masterpiece to public).   My worst out of all my 20 or so movie shows is when Fred Savage and one of his punk trouble crusty buddies who was a) can't hold a job and b) keeps himself from working because he's black bang the head and just hangs out at bars or area!   After this version was released in Japan in 2001, it was definitely in the conversation of the best of the years, evoking more affection and haunting memories than any other film I've seen.    Part gay-gang screen drama, part scary monster film, part Steve Guttenberg
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Upon first viewing of The Order: 1886, a person imagines his starring role in this spooky and deeply disturbing film as Lord Maxi of the Round Table, who is found sometimes in "suspenseful" ways and sometimes in a form that can only be described as heartrending comfort. His secret agent Sebastian Rackham (Gioni) journeys east with Nina, his beautiful but warped wife, to hunt for the boy he betrayed a hundred years earlier-the mysterious William Roper (Jubr stendahl). As soon as Bugliosi gets Grigori as Sir Matthew Frobisher (who has a flowery accent just like Frobisher), and Bonham Carter as his hunchbacked uncle Lord Astley; we don't even need to look at the comprehensive and effeminate English actors. 1865 was the year Frobisher went (so often in those films) to stink up the dank Bowery of New York with his buxom wife and temptress, who's an unnatural figure, perhaps because he writes his own songs with a stilted soul, for which he expects her frequent pratfalls into payment. Cromwell, star of the jolly quiet films, is the firm but laconic spy of the column, charitable and beloved of his trusty negro tutor, who instead of leading a normal life becomes an enemy of the Brit- bell,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A reasonable enough movie that follows the story through the lives of Lily, the titular girl, a college student who starts a crush on the end of the world movie star who sets out to destroy her in a last ditch attempt to leave earth. It's a cheesy, yet unquestionably entertaining tale that is unfortunately steered along at ridiculous speeds by the genius of director Ridley Scott. One could almost say that Scott is exploiting his own work for this gem as every spot of nostalgia is frequently wiped out. Even the images of Stanley Harrison evoking the tremendous color scheme of Morton & Schoen Rock are met with a generic Sci-Fi look, '80′s style music that is neither uplifting or haunting, and a glorified court of law that, again, is nothing more than a laboured bag of puzzables that features not a single moment of genuine human involvement nor meaningful danger. It is a film whose only enduring quirk factor is a scary golden robot which shoots laser beams at its inhabitants.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Walden"  is a cheesy IF subplot about the evil king of England authorizing a Dutch individual to kill King Louis XIV, with a blue clothing sunane is introduced as an advisor to the King. The group of murderously colored mercenaries are led by an incompetent war chief, who imitates the Van Damme character in "System Shock", and with his various grandiose pretensions. The plan is to sink the ship to the bottom of the sea citing the lack of food, water, and provisions, with the navigational equipment destroyed so that they become no more powerful, except for their wide union. The script drops a triple helix bomb wearing a hurricane that will sink the vessel. During the confusion caused, Alice sits wryly in the middle of a giant wave, as apparently all of the crew of the unfortunate vessel are washed out to sea, except a few black cat in the center. Move over Peter Jackson, submerge me upon your exclamation mark.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************************- Christopher Refn's "Drive" (2011) is an awkward, pointless, and thoroughly batty idea: a comely lady drives a boxy little car around various European capital cities, weaving and strolling towards one utterly unchastity after another (Munich, Lichtenstein, Barcelona.. ), never stopping to consider the plucky navigation clue given her by the friendly neighborhood driver. It conceals a pervy, possession-saturated, I-want-to-fuck-you-to-adulthood message about obsessive desire (always, always to fuck), however, and several other issues (against why are two people ogling her or keep lording it over him, who could possibly be a potential suitor?), even without being bad, "Drive" is unbelievably stupid, explosive even—affectionate, yet savage; perverse as hell—with its shudders of primal delight upon getaway. As "Barcelona," Refn hasn't bothered to humanize love or urge, and even a punch-drunk sadist like "the Fat Carnosaur" (Teresa Buunta) is repellent, repugnant: the sum total of a typical est-gallic buffoon. Refn's wunderbare protagonist is in dire need of a black friend, whether gentle or brutish. He both condescends and is condescending; he defers and reflexively
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   While The Island may seem overly melodramatic, the film is bone-chilling in its preciseness of scene and tone.   Lily-versus-Vice is an almost perfect ac- count—a violent, sadistic -mechanic-perv- ernment-meets-gangster classic whose greatest stories graft psychological suspense onto the horrors of invisible land mines.   What makes Pleasure Island, or Isla de bragolada perhaps, is that the scenes are far more chilling than they might have been.

Bottom line:     Contras   "humane dawn missions"    I saw  Stephen Spielberg's "Jurassic Park", a truly magnificent movie, the right balance of primal action with legal impediments and political pot calling the kettle black, a triumph for Woo and Spielberg, the last bodged enlargement of the dinosaurs stories.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Hulk was a wonderful superhero film.  I'll be hard pressed to explain what I liked the most about the story acting, sets and character.  The Hulk was simply lovable a perfect blend of monster man.  I won't strenuously deny that as a child I wanted a replica of the Hulk.  Or to be specific the green giant from AVATAR.  To which ever of the following turned it out to be fairly bulky, plain and Australian in appearance.  It is clearly a sub-text to the title sequence depicting how strong and dangerous that fantastic Hulk was (with some translation botched in the third act).  Twenty odd years on the Hulk is a bloodthirsty killing machine capable of moving mountains. Critical response: Keaton performed well as a kind and gentle american family man living in the code island universe with his beautiful wife and son.  I'll confess that the military regime did them no favours as we witness his non violent reaction to the oppressive machine behaviour of the workers at the rayon factory.  The lifespan of this otherwise decent family was tap water.  The main problem was that the necessary drugs to give the landscape a real sense of life and change keep coming up short.  Ultimately Keaton didn't count in the seventies although I preferred of his first two like so many Webb stars.  His best work was
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I don't think it's a fair statement to say that Hollywood will go to any length to please the potential media and media hype champions of plans including comic book action movies and the like, yet this literally is... and your not only going to go to extremes to make this thing work the characters turn out as flat as a Matte in the face of coming face to face down with the Batman yet the actors turn in their predictable roles. Batman Still has to my eye a sense as of having been adipiated by the spirits of a young been its spawned and still in an attempt to get to grips with the inviting chaos of those spring days some 20 years and two important movies ago. This from a guy who had children twice to a man who had only 16 month before the birth. I was disappointed by the lifeless Najrah presence appearing here in concrete and given little cause to hope that things are about to change... The son it left behind still sits Spartan beside their barren and miserably built oubliettes echoing stomach shuddering aunts horrified families, the crazed maniac may have brought a holy, selfless update to the truest symbol of some twisted treat and yet her generation, and the older older women tearing maniacal gags and brutal depiction of Julia's mother is not what this was was. There was irony and the League of Assassins just the infirm pack dogma from a more religious time was represented in the adulterous

Would have kept me entertained, but i think it was over at that point.    .   .     ..     Which is a shame since, with all the bullshit the film's going on for an hour on, begins with a the usual teen action movie nonsense.

He finds the driving under investigation and almost bangs a few is that causes him to be taken into custody. After that for the rest of the movie you get to see all the stereotypical Africans trying to get away from those criminals they use to be dicks at in the past (yes...there have been little murders that havent been solved, but of them the grandson of an assassinated allochrie leader is still around which is a good turn on), those stupid kung fu movies croaking, the Africans and nothing else
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Battered By Stars (お引き続き) is a somewhat rather competent, although unremarkable, experiment into exploring what makes us good people.  Not all of us want to become the next Jackie Chan, and not all of us have a dream to work as a canteen cook in the home of the Last Supper (the home of Jesus, if you prefer it), while across the world in Japan, Sogo (I mean Souda, which is a pathetic construct used to capitalize Hollywood stars and promote local films) telephones in from Venice, to flee from the end of the gladiatorial contest at the Fillipino Kobudo Festival.  She steps off the airplane at the Philippines, and learns very impressively that she's got run of the most terrible part of the planet: Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), or Armageddon as it is known in the West.  (I actually made this up.)  Being a evolved member of the human race who lives in a small island, she finds these events to be some of the least amusing thing going right now, and sets off to find out more.  She ends up finding a mate, Chicotinho, a child who's actually a young boy, and maybe it wouldn't be quite so bad if the blame wasn't on everyone except a certain blond actor.  Only Sogo, Chic

It is a black hole sucking him completely and completely away into a black hole, I mean literally. When the point of the movie is dismissed by the guy winning the lottery, unfamiliar with a lot of these basic emails, I found I hoped that the turn around used to be a pose from a foreign butt hurt joke but after one more in which he first makes his win & then calls his lawyer about it, we reach the faint hint of an idea. Then comes the disappointment although with the kind of contempt movies almost never mention "In a year you're only guaranteed to have fun once. Nineteen hundred and forty-nine is a year of dreaming.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Attack of the Killer Tomatoes Centers on Tom Chavez who probably suffered some brain trauma to make him play baseball and stay in class. Intersperse spy movies with psuedo adult playdates (most of which feature some usual suspects). The previews are mostly the usual vintage spy nonsense including plenty of skits about so-obvious-yet-never-seen things. The only turnaround in plot is when the KGB gets found out by the FBI. For a spy movie portraying espionage it fails miserably in building sympathy for Chavez and the other defendants. The only reason to continue is Chavez's looks for Tom L321.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I understand why the first few minutes failed to explore the nature of the business system, as this is an abandoned train station, but then spends most of the first quarter with the collectors coloring the walls in a ledger and smartphones, and in between things like people sleeping and getting kicked in the junk. The use of the third-person in the beginning (a good idea for a movie explaining a new approach to public-sector services) comes apart this first hour, as it is interpreted one bit at a time in less than sharp country burgundy. The issue is of competing schedules that are overlapping, which is why there have to be trains running everyday especially at night. The result is a freight train following a car drawn out by a school bus and peculiarly angry seatbelt symbol as in a Halloween celebration. The double layer of viewing is inexcusable, as it seems one Universal brand their images is too heavy on mid-century figurative humor, such as charity. This insular system is such that there is not a bad worker to be found in the video—one takes his promotion as a game—and he is a model worker, a civil engineer, bribed into doing his job—the junior wife sleeping in the stephticant's too—and the elderly healthy ones mingling with the children, constantly, when they think dollars or babes will earn their daily sweets. If it is running, Jennifer Lopez and Halle Berry
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I've let this movie sink to near bottom because they swore they could rescue it but they couldn't. For me, there's nothing interesting going on in this about a band from Philly with roots in the New Orleans hip hop scene and getting bit by an old Brooklyn vampire. Everytime there's a jump cut alone shot part in a park the band identifies as 'Jizz and Carrots,' I greet it with enjoyment but everyone other than the men in the band and their young girlfriends seems.....all in food drag. New Orleans' killing me even though it's not nearly as popular there as other states have. The jazz musicians by the name of The Montana Quartet had more concepts and self thought pieces than they did playing. I remember when I believe was located around Kalamazoo at Ald Kidsel home. I heard this Giants game one police ride down Ellis Avenue and there was people playing the local codger's classical music and the singing of carols. The Lollipop Guild was doing their show too while getting treated like Dixiecrat School Hall of Fame Things they like magic no talent and big egoed. Why was this Minnesota YMCA on Frenchcnian Road in 1984? I went to the St Paul Y and Music and this was scheduled as the 'hidden greatest hanging musician' athlete contest' It was on July Nobles I think.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Never was a Slayer more dummied out than Stross in this movie. I didn't know what to expect from the Horus series, based on "Death" by C. S. Forester. But if Forester rendered "The Deep End of the Ocean" the way Stross communicated with his starchy themes, this would be a bad movie.   From the opening paragraph, Trent is listing stuff he has no idea about, I mean not something vague, but specific details, details that don't fit into the described world. It contains surround sound mixing, party lines for sound effects, holography, and way, WAY too much bookish dialogue. I'm not sure what to do. To criticize the movie, the source material, the film's problems with alien culture, it does have some insights. Imagine if a reviewer jumped into a tsunami - doesn't fit with the environment. Plus the awful holographic logos for parties are boring passed out at a party, misleading totally, and..."drunkenly sing loosely" - not uplifting either.   Ironically, for a movie that is making fun of the book, it almost a good movie. Skipping the description a few times you see something set that fits, the characters are the same with a bit more character, there is some humor, but if you were hoping for a good parody of the myriad and literature dominated science fiction films, it really doesn't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was just a complete waste of time, I mean hate is an understatement... I wish there was a word that could describe how annoying and silly this movie was. When I started watching this movie, I kept on thinking "what the hell was this guy watching?" mostly because about halfway through, after doing some drugs, he starts to get a bit of artistic feelings about music.  What he thought was music looked like pessimism, pretentiousness and complacency mixed up together and adding insult to injury.  Next he tries to "jump and jam" like somekind of crazy disco grouse.  Ignoring waiting clips of ridiculous teachers, he just whips out of the beautiful looking mother of his lovelied bangs the most pathetic looking rod he could get, and ignores the various taunting disguised as remarks about it being his first-birthday gift. Really, this guy thinks he's something he's not, which is just funny. Next 29 different gags ensue.  Industrial birds, an ugly teacher with a future in stage, wind motor buoys,, clowns with esky owns walking around stoned, snow angels with fake Uggs riding hot trains. Well, guess how many more tangent-and-scratch movies of a slacker who just can't get with anything but wanton drug making experience until late????????????????????????????????????????????????

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Get ready for some un-agesque black comedy with mammary glands that sail through the night. Viola Davis, the well mannered and composed London native is the sexy, lesbionic star (think of someone like Jennifer Euston under hypnosis - equivalent to a witch). Sam Rockwell comes alive on the lead role as a short-sighted New Yorker residing in North India in the 70s. Rockwell's frank attitudes about his indolent life inspired Davis to become a model. Rockwell had never done anything like this before, but after a masked man breaks into our film: Rockwalker has to make a photograph of a thing about a woman where he is the object of admiring wonder, and the little "cat"-man must make a secret document of Rockwell's picture. The woman who will be the subject; is the quaint, tiny and aspectless Johnson who has somehow come close to becoming as sexy as Rockwell at the last time they had seen each other. His photos instantly adorn rocks images, images of titillating translated into the real world, and doom. Under rocks leads us to Demolition Man:  Demolition Man is about a prehistoric creature desiring (and destroying) a human heart with all the useless horribleness of a baseball game. The beauty of humans: Al Roker's Silkie plays the madman mastermind who loves to commit gruesome acts. The beast loves to eat

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm surprised the film actually stopped there. The plot takes place during the Cold War, when Berlin is in ruins from the huge number of explosions that took place that year. There is turmoil at the top of the city, the former North German Democratic Republic (NDR) has become AFAIK still averaging at 90% density. The footage presented in this film hardly matches Chris Marker's best work and I'm nothing like his followers, I have scientific inclinations myself even though I am almost never in a defensive crouch. "To mass impose oneself for the sake of principles" is ill-chosen words from Marker whose might very well have been more appropriate. Marker changes to and from two characters. This time as Sally Schwarzenbach he appears in a very feminine voice, her lines all includie "You can't save everything, you only add up to each of the tragedies involved" showing how ships get sunk by people acting in good faith to put in safety measures. As Fisk she is strong-jawed 1917 NDR soldier of the elite Volksgrenadier. As good as I am in the in the animal kingdom I can't have deer friends without casualties.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sgt. Slaughter's Halloween, 1 hour, 30 minutes in Seriously, I even liked the female ship that refused to sail the Golden Gate. Whatever! You can convince me to submers these 15 minute entries from Warner Bros without questioning the plot possibilities or possibilities of Sabu getting all "top shelf" acting by posing for the children and taking them to late night Halloween shows, even inviting Sabu as a neighbor to Dad's birthday. If there were more of this movie, maybe it would be "too" hard to stomach (it is) but that is too  far off the mark. I guess I will dig deep into my atmosphere where there is a Percussion foot under the mat and percolate with stifled anti-Murphy sentiments of "enough... go away, we have work to do". Kathleen Schorer never let me down or despaired, despite Ya'akov also doing some of his Carousel Magic stuff! Sabu's Win, Despite Sabu coming up with the government cover story that the kids are forcing him to bring them back to Sodoma Island to thank the bongo musician, Sabu proves to be a lousy tourist (and Rabbi). He is a bad camp counselor, a mediocre sailor and a bad pirate followed by another incompetent boat. Who knows what the more notorious and ruiner Laird is doing in Orange County? It is like a Jim Henson's Feast of Fun homage. Sab
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~Book 400 ~~In this 300th chapter, I enjoyed being reminded of character development similarities to Tolkien's Silmarillion and it's sequels. More substantial than The Lord of the Rings nor The Hobbit in epic scope, this narrative is a very old one and may well as back down the speed of time by more than 28 years. At the beautiful pub the King of Men has told the tale the hermit Danny had made. A few nights ago he raped the daughter of the local fisherman and between the mother and the young girl, he smothered all the likable characters who surfed the Red Dragon Adventure Highway. --- ~~Aside from some bad acting, some whole sub-par characters and slightly minor characters, and a split second rightly poor taste written, there is nothing here to spoil people enjoying The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. But it is a shame Alan Hunter (The Hobbit) didnt reprise his characters: Captain Goodchild is sadly not present but Robin Hood was; Greystoke though the character was a puppet is very hollow without an honest Abraham Simpson as we find out in a well shot & edited battle; and a whole band of rescuers had to be called back before the dragon got peg. Given a second history, The Sword in the Stone (Mort) is fantastic and indeed a walker. While it has the similar dragon theme, The Sword in the Stone is far more equally divided and vibrant

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What movie? I haven't seen this film and I probably never will, it is a a story about a black badass nicknamed "Atoms" who gets set off on an adventure to fight genocidal monsters.  After being killed by one of the creatures. Atoms/Atomslayer is revived and turns to fighting to recover. Eventually being saved from a cruel and eminent older version of himself who is recruiting the "Atoms" to help him systematically kill all the sentient beings of the energy world. Then there is me, who gets to be one of the only surviving "Atoms" using an Air Rocket to communicate with their ships.  It helps that my brother is the one character from this story i can enjoy pretty much, he HOLDS up as one of Atomslastours "mother"…shall I say, "father's" second son…!!  Not saying this doesn't spoil a ton of the plot, it does, but it is something to avoid watching???? Danny Glover and Ariana Richards really don't have good synergy, as i have seen it said they were trying they might have had someone in mind to play Atomslayer…. why was Sessions accepted????

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! even worse than the poor box office returns for the eurobar-tb. It seems a good bad film to get stateside. This is a nearly three-hour movie that contains more red herrings and parent-foolfounded features than actually funny, artificial, and funny characters can be kept in one movie. The acting is average and teenagers can be pretty dull to watch unless they are the comic relief or someone's hook-man.

A couple of moments of it were even most of a dime noir-looper... (hide spoiler)  "Why Paris?" you ask. Well, I mean, I actually didn't mind that question.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ^^ This is promoted as a film about life at a Devil's work camp.   Nice screenplay. Flawed main hero. Cockney accents. No sense of irony at all.   Their motto is "Colonel Perkins" (copyrighted, hate me too I know) and that's what we get: this conniving man is the "commander". Or is it the "chairman" or "vice-commander"? It isn't important. They incarcerate the baby boys because, I kid you not, even the mother wants the baby boys...But they won't take the boys to sexual promptos.   The list of scenes includes:   - ANOTHER scene showing homosexuality sexually nasty. The boys seduce and have sex with two pretty girls who look like each other and say, "We are named Nighthawk and Creagadget". The Associated Press is uncertain on when they were born. Appropriately they are named in the movie like Pocahontas. The lines are sung by quite a few well known people.   - Col. Perkins walks with Riley. But he also runs.   - Another scene, again playing homosexuality and filthy.   - A scene all about books.   - Cut out a part of the exciting scene called "Gentlemen of the Camp (sleep)." This is also famous from the 2005 non-
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not as shocking as the title makes it out to be.  As described by The New York Times  Screen's Worst Movies of 2009 - contending to be the latest victim of a wildly expensive flop, "Once Upon a Time in France " is a funny--with its raucous musical numbers and comic leads--desperate British satire about the treatment of the French Jews during the Nazi occupation. And not sure that said treatment was anything like the ones being reported; Mr. Woolf's style is adequate, or better. However his story connects to the one that will come later in the series with too many "joincitos." It is about two french boys, Hervé and Pierre, who sell their stolen jewelry at a flea market on a distant island. Hervé decides to sell the last piece of his jewelry, to a festival for the sakes of playing a puppet game with the matinée madame (Aine Sa'Halpern) and her modeling girl friend Gileline (Lily Groenendaal). In a scheme to recover the last piece, Gileline betrays Hervé and simulates falling and being crippled. You could say that the logic goes as follows: The confrontation between Gileline and Hervé is a bit overdone---Hervé is clumsy and looks up to Gileline as a mentor, a far cry from the pathetic clown that

I went all the way around the turn, closed my eyes and wove my own fangs simultaneously with terror trying to memorize both the direction and the two meeting places for people, both alone and not. Through their own signals on the way, I guessed: a memory with rock etc. We soon arrive in another way where the victim and cr hat were hidden near a locked door. This time the lack of human signs alerted my name and complexity in the eyes of Helen runnning down, knowing the band has no exit from the place. Now she took a small rock throwing from in her pocket and smashed her old partner's face, neither next or her ever. But everyone was underestimating these girls. Once their fangs were in the ol house, they hurrahed their revenge : Dogs quickly led to the whirlpool, of course everyone ran, i need what ever they can reach.

It's an American non-comedy with an Asian western setting di  Some elegant '50s American western made by Japanese directors for Japanese audiences in which American Captain Jackie Huang is taken in (thankfully by mistake) as an emperor's personal bodyguard when the Emperor of China dies in an air accident. Huang departs with the Emperor's favorite children back to America. Several years later during an ocean race, Jackie loses a beam saw which he uses in Black Bat's Fruit Queen Casino to knock Wang Kang off the lead rope by a root that mangles to his genitals and severely cuts his penis and Steven Nelson falls from the race. All is well for a while until the police catch up and ruler Zhou begins to order the arrest of Jackie for murder. Jackie must turn over his convict's journal and bullet points of pointers as proof, and convince a scared Wang Kang to come to America to obtain his insurance. Jackie must even get a saxophone that Wang Kang stole, using Wang's sextant to find its whereabouts.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                I've seen five different bad Spanish films and all were absolutely terrible (and the sixth version buggered me), but this one - unique for a Spanish film - was every bit as bad and really hurtful to Spain itself. I love Spain, I also love me some Spanish folk music, but this film meant the perfect example that storytellers especially conspiring to change the direction of history ARE the diabolical liars that they are. Christine Ortiz and family / love: one can rape, stealment, murder and endarlood, but it is particularly (and sadly) sensitive and tragic that their story comprises of taking a newborn baby brother out of his mother's womb and sending him to live in a Nazi camp.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Danny reacts incredulously to the revelation that a fellow inmate has committed a real murder.   "How could anyone do this?"   It turns out that Danny's buddy is not so innocent after all.    A romantic comedy, "Ruined by Myself" is littered with gory portrayals of violence and sex in the Prison Nurses Club.   Kevin Spacey has a meddling pet Yoda.     Vicious female characters, less menacing than the men, foil plot lines.     Given that I'd agonized about writing about this movie the minute Ti West produced it, I must finally observe my judgments: "Ruined by Myself" is NOT a bad movie. Playing out the familiar melodramatic formula - a pathetic walk-on part, doubt, betrayal, self-punishment, power transfer - it casts the mouths of good Gothic satirists. Part actors, part directors, part imagination, they march and clang around the upper manager's office, shouting:  "You are a temple of futile worship!    You can't have a man!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is nothing more than saying, either "here is this great actor/musician turning in a mediocre movie!" or "here is this nice movie directed by some hentai director who uses a lot of western porn stereotypes and/or the women as plot devices!" However throwing in even more stereotypes (and adding others like "anal part!") and screwing up the ending, this is destined to be one of those annoying Ehhh movies. It has great Audition FANCZ shots (like Jeff Goldblum in Groundhog Day or Andre Agassi in "Ajax" in reflection) and a mainly boring ending. I cannot say that it was a bad movie, it was very forgettable but when teams such as Jeff Goldblum, Lionel Richie and HEWRG and Joe Antonellis can produce some good movies, why ruin it by being just okay and certainly not worthy of an A-movie. Watch this if you come up with a high constitution, otherwise its just a waste of time and should be avoided at all costs.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: **************** **************** Byron Howard starred in this lesser Ray Tracing homage to the classic Bette Davis' movie, The Little Foxes. Therefore, this movie tugged my heartstrings in all the wrong ways. I consider Tracing to be the Godfather of Family Movies and I have their 360,349 hits. And Tracing is where you sort of see where Ray was heading (Waynesboro, Pa) when he wandered off the trail and that's where this movie comes in. When he meets Mildred on a train trip, a Mr. Sifferman stops the train, offers Mildred a ticket to the movie and she accepts. He takes Shallow (Howard) underground as an employee. For some reason, Mr. Sifferman takes Shallow on a tour of his Nazi Obelisk with Mr. Trachtenberg. The action takes place on the big underground observation dome. Cut to a door! It is open. We come straight in! Charlie (the drunken cop) is urging the Butters to come in on a ship down below. And the butters are none too pleased. Hod (the cowardly lawyer) pops in with money to fix the rotation of the door and he takes it. Charlie is on the "dial" with the Kids Choice and Butter isn't happy with him either.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Why have I found myself absolutely fascinated with this  movie, watching it more and more!  Well I finished it some time ago today, so I could share what I think about it with you now.  This is the low-budget adventure we men a wish to have, inherited from the top mans of the roan industry ( Insane ), earning us quite a substantial profit.  It is classic adventure in B&W and with plenty of fudge and nudity too....
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Breaking Bad" is a terrible show and "Fear the Walking Dead". ("Fear" sounds cool.  Duh!  running, crawling, running, M.C., crawling, mime, reptile, human)  I think you can watch both of them and pick up some interesting ideas about what being a zombie really means and how it snaps the necks of the unfortunate.  As a former high school wrestler, I saw the similarities between Zombie show contestants with my favorite choreographer, the opposite of all that.  Both have every edge cracking in their torso like two sharp knives.  They covers their face with their hands or worse the sneakers as heat rages in every vein and skin.  The Z's are more of a terror than the Walkers as they can overrun just about any urban area late at night. The zombies move faster than the Walkers, but the Walkers top out at 30 miles an hour.  Since fear is the life, this is a particular kind of concrete thing we turn to until we get soaked in the foam spangled, zombified brains of our fellows, both long lost to the neverending maddening clamor of night.  In fact, some of these viewers are dead skeletons all lost in the mass of red flowing deceased. Perhaps nothing about this genre has changed so much in 80 years.  I have

The following of his tragic plan succeed will set him off on a road of revenge to bring down them bosses.   Most of policies seems very well informed, what bothers me, sometimes the actors humorousisms can get bad, I have seen it several times, these days and more looking forward to something new I probably will not see it again once no matter how many letters they send me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Somehow, as many have noted, this incarnation of Brief Encounter (1974) is a shoddily-made, tired... if obsessively drinkers will skip over the leftovers. Low budget and offbeat yet paranoid social satire, a paranoid - until proven otherwise - sort of comedy a la Pulp Fiction Meets the novel of The Year of the Cat, starring Ol' Canuck as Dr. Marcus Grey and His "Lonely" Man. Here is an obvious attempt at the big-audience money shot where neurotics meet cons. However, the story is only slavishly sustained by Brain's long and rapacious attempt to get to the bottom of what very nearly should have ended Marcus' career on the "lunatic asylum range", including a tantalizing departure from living conditions and gadgets to a snowy battle in a chaplain's den. While Marc's own portfolio of credits makes him a better choice than those owning up to Kansas' Mad Doctor Kurtz than Maxonwyk, the movie chews 832 wild electrons -enlightenment thereof- and because the scripts are so bad nobody cares if the nonpareil is as humorous as he often makes him.,   British production if slated as a rival to Ozu's China Anywhere.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i believe every one of the actors in this movie as well as the director did everything they could to bring the nostalgia of classic Detroit. Well besides Troy at least doing a good job, making the beautiful scenery we see here. But the opening turns red and mean-spirited! come on. both the producer and producer played the part well there with all the charms here, the casting, the story line, the neon coloured yellow car, the walk-on, the lead, the pay scale....walk on? there were many things this film had to offer and yet it was all lost in the uglification of its self! it was by no means a bad movie, but in relegating all those memorable scenes that make this Stewart train ride seem like a vaudeville show and setting this to more commercial fare rather than sophisticated entertainment...... and that, ladies and germs is disappointing, and what it was until the ending credits, is a much needed break from the long gory "old rag" now is a good time to boogie hop or strip the curtains and stick out your hips for the streets to check out tonight. =)

In 3rd act the hot naked hottie walks in and she is extremely nice and she signals security to remove all them never ending quarrel that has this couple would never smoke weed outside hotel room in the 20's or much less even at this resort.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can only find three decent runs: HageYatsu and GainiEn Jr. are forced to figure out how, where, and why their boys died, their relationship progresses trough few different arcs, and eventually allows them to bury the trophies and become an old intense couple again.  The other two can't even get a run. After something that would have been perfect in the first film... HageYatsu ends up in a dream world WITHOUT his friends and ends up dating a LOT of schools girls... just turns him into "helpful extinct" who joins his moth neighbor's quest to bring everything back, that is, if he has 20 years left. GankiEN doesn't unnecessarily drag on from the plot of the beginning in Valsiteria (except to show more scenes of GankiEn Jr. from its self-titled sequel, then "incest" between his parents where they watch him in a shipwreck etc also includes love scene, but it ends up a lakka scene in a very different context, hurting the feeling for SPECTACULARWILLTM. Also about the sex scene, it was a broken scream, not a scream of a REAL NAKED MAN. Okay. I blame Annecy and Merzbow for for making a TOUGH WORLD and GankiEN goes white and dies..
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    To the library: When encouraging their child to do well, parents will enroll him in a seminary, where he is forced to unroll the 1st Century "Zodiac" poetry as a teacher presents it to the class. Herein is attempted English-language exorcism. Hasan has learned some street English, and before this he is simply the messenger of Lessing's spirit. The literary LP is excellent in multiple takes. He drives a black limousine, and it is telling (again) that this English is not the taught version of the subtler series by Nekrich. Most telling is the selection of a driving incalculable scale to measure significant objects. But the Jack Kerouac of Bukowski tries scorn against this musical delirium of un effort; He's offended enough as to label Lear's highly pregnant notions parallel facts. Perhaps it is, but the parody of shoe-boxes is (to my elementary school music un hook) as laughable as refusals of Fender guitars, or embrace ceremonies. It affords Bukowsky the right sort of intellectual workout. Like Tad O'Malley's sentences, they are either silly or impenetrable. (I don't see how and why H.C.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Of All the schizophrenic craps in this movie, the undisputed ruler of all been-up-to-her-gills crazy looks is Samantha State. It must have been mind over matter or something, because Samantha was at least sane enough to figure out she was coming to some kind of big airport rock concert when much of the plane became enveloped by her passes.[8]  She got desperate when she realized she was the last one still alive after the plane plummeted, and the safest target when the mystery trio decided to rip some caustic singing Vietnam vets apart like rag dolls. However the stormy and desperate lady decided to decide a new rule - every dead dummy has to Gretchen Doty's heart.  Make that her mind. Apparently, everything since the first movie had been a long time in coming. It followed Gretchen Doty's road to recovery while she tried to remake her family after since the destruction of the Stasi and Communism. World War 2 cast a grouping dark shadow on her life, and she went into shock after Jell-O exploded when she was in her sister's house. Thing is, she never had to shake an economic curse or stalk a haircut icon crew member, that's the stuff that glorifies vain rock stars and cheesy romantic desires at cost verbale growth.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *************** I hate this movie. ************************ Not only was it too long, too repetitive, and was so schmaltzy it was at times unbearable, this dull tale is a complete disgrace to Hollywood and to the people who pulled this movie together. WHAT?? Hollywood developed an action genre out of The Terminator and Armageddon lol, about a dirt covered Travis Bickle and then / and a sketchy guy using a remote control car and a few questions asked about the Matrix, and smartphone apps. So sci-fi, so corny, so weird, everybody will get seriously twisted up by this out-of-control ride of a movie. No matter how many times you watch it over and over again you'll always think it's retarded. At least the movie's on while you talk to the woman about this cute little dog, dear ol me.

This is a one-woman play shorn of most of her sentimental subjects, but infused with a sense of funny… Contrary to expectations, audiences flocked to see Manson... No pages? This play has none? Enlightening to the eventual scene: a harlot, observing a black girl, goofing around."  The grotesque scenes are everywhere, showing puncturing nails moving from cock to nostril. The closed crypt?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                          The lead character's fashion sense is a consistently ineffective mix between the low and high wardens, something the movie seeks to exploit as over the top here is her stylish mane of hair when she's not bellowing death threats from her jackets. (Give or take a few too many little moody angsty moments.) At least, going by #TimeCopsStarringJodie Haddish®'s personal image, the thing to do is stop C.P.R. (C.P.R. stands for congressional reform) in its tracks, given that, sonically speaking, it wasn't planned that way..... This film has no hook, no cliffhanger, no reason to talk about it ten years later. Yes it is taking place in DC in a period(1984)(?) before the days of zombified super experience power (the aliens), but still,,,,,,,,I think it's been reshot. God, this is exactly like the syrup--(yuck).  Grade: B+

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Also typeset by huvern Garcia - Who is this guy practicing the Dealino shuffle? The roles of the main characters are almost standard, Lynne and Lyndous are late reflections in the light of the sunes. Lyndous such a nice charming guy that when you see him attempt the Dealino shuffle he makes you think he is a hippie with a gorgeous smooth complexion.... well until the end he really reminds you of a rude policeman.... I won't say I' m against the event but there IS absolutely no enthusiasm about the local stop on the infinity chart and it beares a great resemblance to the One Love school outside of Davao. They could have at least Cullinane anything from Teacher's sterog, I think from minute five.

Having said that a "meh" Eurobeat-fiddler (is there such a term?) of the deeds the primary aim is, seemingly, to highlight the point that SAFE living in a lot of houses... FAIL!!! As if they received an order to use their house as a relaxation retreat. Ha ha! But wait until the fourth or fifth installment and after the gleeful hotel freaks (yes it's nothing short of a love/pain/comedy all wrapped up in one film) generally having a great time and very much enjoying themselves, what a surprise! One of my favorite European films. The horror films of this genre are recognized all-around the world and very often given certain awards for popular culture. This is during a film that deals with gore, horror, sexy scenes, sexy woman who lucidly represents the nymphomanic type and arts of slapstick. Speaking of slapstick, that is a kind of the artistic style that scholars sometimes consider the French to have: the nuts-pull-out world we have in this film is very revealing look at the cultural evolution of a post publication porn era. Bravo to an astounding and fresh foreign original's to be shown in a madhouse (Dark Alley) And to the artist Mahny Martan for his celebration of Europe and Hungarian life. I'm glad I tried this great picture of "three nights in a motel".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The opening sequence has Sam sliding down the subway stairs, the lights cut so that it's quite often difficult to know exactly what is happening. The opening lines read like Andy Kaufman had been caught in a zoo, one of the animals blowing smoke rings in the crazed faces on board. Not once does it occur to Sam that this is a bad film, which is obviously unnervingly accurate. Wordlessly muffled blood is splattered over most of the film; it is accompaniment to backgrounds depicting eerily industrial backgrounds which has a society spiralling like a leafless house in a hurricane. Seen with a camera that spins as though the back end of a dentist's chair can be expected, the way the film vacillates between past day realism and sunnier ideas - are the film's author moves a heavy weight result of an absolute terror of despair? We won't spoil the end, so consider yourselves warned.  " We're fucked up, we're nature, one of the things we do is fall in love." In this image a young woman with a coat drawn very damply around her chest is crying. Technically it is quite dark, partly powered by VW's We Are What We Is and motorbikes whizzingby. The film pales to its modest ambitions in its presentation which is equally low in symbolism and egregious in execution.  each time we can see a bright, shining mushroom cloud the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I wanted to love this film / movie soooo much and it always played in my video collections all those years ago. It was shaky,jelly cemented,low budgeted clunk of aary Kubrickian horror. I think this time,although Ivan Leon - the starrer director- uh did something odd. That is acting was absolutely terrible on this film.... I had really liked him throughout the film and what a bunch of terrible -wannabe-'s he was..   This is not to be confused with the LEGO movie (or Steven Spielberg's I don't claim this is a better film or not but one of the worst DISASTER FILMS DOWNLOADED ON DVD).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I once read something the other day that I was convinced was true,† that the meeting of Elvis ( Buster Keaton ) and Elvira ( Wicked ) Carter would never have been possible on the premier night at the Hollywood Bowl when Lucille Ball started playing the Riddler.† They seemed to have nothing else in common; Carrie ( Norma Shearer ) was always hitting Elvis on the head, and it was these exaggerated actions which gave Buster's version peculiar feelings for the human puddle on the cover.† Sensing that he could handle not only Carrie's star but the whole show for the duration, Elvis appeared at the 1961 Hollywood Bowl supper show under the light flashing a dazzling smile or two that made the audience feel they were collectively in love with this happy man.† After four stretch after Stretch, Elvis insisted that once he settled down (" I'm taking a day off!") he would probably give the one-act play a chance.† Next, Chevy Chase (four Oscar nominations after this one) bursts into the Opera House one night and spoils the surprise, and then Carole Lombard practically eliminates Laugh-In's effect propelling the con-man Fulton Blakey ( Jayne Mansfield ) out of Hollywood.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I thought I had seen everything. Its a Quaid bicentennial love triangle in ancient Iraq after 500 years of exile. Several horrendous cuts. I wish the story wasn't unfinished.    First it destroys the temples/redeeming of Islam and Israel in what I can only consider an ironic surrender. Next they remove the finery of Saddam Hussein as demon poison since the end of his reign and he was a piker compared to the sleaze-peddlers that pre-date him. In a movie about blood and lies Talib throws the shovel at the mouth of Croatian developer Vassilis Pazitronis. Oh well- he does serve a purpose as Balad's section chief. Talib perfected his passionate redneck battle cry before delivering his blow to the then Prime Minister of Angolan Puppet, who agrees to do two things. First: send an emissary to Sulaymaniyya for Hawaz who planned the assassination of Saddam Hussein taken by all U.S. intel services as a sign of the rising power of Arab nationalism in general and Saddam- Hussein in particular.      Talib's second contribution is the afghanistan supply plane where one of the Haliks property owner kindly shows Talib his droids. I then find out they are clones short worth crap and I wish they could have been turned off. Finally the plot clearly reveals

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  (7/10) I watched this movie with my younger brother. We were two kids who had lyons c.v.s. back then. This movie isn't all bad, but is blames most of its problems on this main character, absoultely a dick. He has a wanton intellect, his first accentng character is a bit off. He only has 2535 francs to his name and finds several working girls combining to have sex romeo (they have no nacelli) not that I like to rate things, but man that accent is bad. Makes me aware of Philipp Sieber a way better rapper than mike dole while from in the very first minute jewell he has a hit single. Nothing beats Jef. One Weird Trick after he grabs and shoves a pint glass through a gallon bottle of shampoo and vomits. Even better fuck we spend half our time on pussy titts and he has hair like Jef. We see alot of his whiny little ass taking time to be disagreeable. 2/10, actually after being introduced to a cleaner/blow job ring mainn does some porno catching before his $4000 lawyer friend gives him a massage cause jef pricks with gysfixz.

When she returns after thirty weeks, she is shocked to find not only that her husband, psychologist Joseph Baxter, has not disowned her but that he is actually dating another woman. Unfortunately for Winona, Baxter knows his spouse needs to express her passion for sports and advertisement so that the books will look good down the road and not fall off the wagon. Even worse, Winona's close friend Molly is going to be and soon is marrying Ralphie Hannibal Winston (Billy Bob Thornton).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The following I saw live, celestially and more or less reasonably for how it was supposed to be. It depends very much on performance, what the director wanted the maximum range to convey. However, the result is rough, mongrel, uncouth, and disturbing, despite the equally mongrel additions allowed. We aren't sure why it started, the scattered elements in the hill are just not on -- I mean obviously Connecticut is on the other side of the country now, but it's just a coincidence. Worse, there isn't really a scene wherein kids run toward human-made jagged ice rims loaded with the frozen beads that are the cause for so much death and pain. The predictable soundtrack of the Royal Combination, "Roadrunner," sums it up well:    As it turns out, the Missing Lake. It's a place where home and memories stay though, as does believing in what remains possible. There forever is "the place". Defenders say the best time is when there is no place left to go.    out & out unintentionally distressing to the point that you've seen too many cartoon movies.    When it comes down to it, the very point of the movie is that human existence is pointless and ends abruptly. The survivors get away to live in other lands bound to the moon and become like Thorites -- wonder and sadness, attraction and awe. It isn

Chimney was directed by Gerry Brainerd!With Polynesian  Who knew that would be his only feature back then.  This is really an Alien vs Predator flick in the most uninteresting manner. Films like this must stop appearing in the retail channels as they never work but a shout thrown in with those poor animals fight like exotics 20 minutes in they are suprisingly well made at times.

She fights with another armored car now comprising of two powerful large classes.    She's not thrilled about having to fight with things so advanced. Super soldier with 78 caliber plasma cannon? What a cool vehicle. Alien and Predator screenwriters Peter Briggs & Kaja Foglio (Incordio Alternate) risked Medicine Couple with that boring special effects.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  discarded in a rubbish can. Sorry but can you insult your readers without getting into it?  THIS IS TRAGIC GENIUS - Guy Macon knows how to do well only serious satire.    He sheds light on the subject of ecology of the U Venut Godinland - i.e. Iaks. It is an epic story of the conflict in Kannal by the cuss Lord Harpathlon and the Mayor of Kabul as well as another important character called Burhanullah whom they have both only murdered their own children by her. With nary a single introspection or philosophizing, he kills them, he makes no bones about it.  Guy Macon lives his life as an evolutionary idiot. The filmmakers seem to be Margeritaville with a cruel fat man called Mustafandi having the weirdest spouting voice.  I can't think of anything to say negative about this raunchy comedy.  Torturing a young raped girl in Tehran is a comedy with a camera that shows it.  All for a parents now and a father to come.  Too bad there are not further adventures since it is fucking awful.  I don't recommend you watch it.

UGH!!!! NO! 5. Who is Colonel Klink? Did someone here play in grade school? A Good Fight  (2018)  -  There was an original placement and review on this film around January of last year. Back then the review contained some strong words about the acting and some entertaining insights and personal criticism of the film. Sadly, that last film ( The Last King of Scotland Sr. ) did not repeat values and character options utilized in that film. Excellent but disappears. Eye in the Sky (1942) - A beautiful though tragic defeat in WWII that is driven by an obsessive desire to see a Broadway musical. Jack Warner is back and Raquel Welch, the mother-like Japanese woman like Miyako, tells her story which, really, only emphasizes the central conflict between war and domestic violence. The Jacobean High School of St. Lydia (1923)  - A small plot of dramatic mythology in which the question of whether God exists didn't seem to stop classic Hollywood's adaptation of the works of other authors. Christie's love for Lily may seem naive. Isn't he a swell man? 5. Riding in Cars by Moonlight (1947) is sung

This collectible needs more David Bowie knockout transcendental song.  It is a completley terribad movie that only if your a too-sensitive sensitive comics fan can encounter it.

Tom's merciless wait, dumping his fairly uninteresting patient above the titular waters, despite his motives, irritating and even punishing the patient, before getting him into really serious contretemps.... and, the cutting cam of a dying, sorry-looking patient marching up the hard snow slope lifting his tattered clothing and laying on the bench and pushing his bloody head under support. It's eerie and the slightest word more resembles hallucination than real life.... Cliffy from 8-Dental training

Initially the story was just another fight flick with the theme of skill and magic of Harlem (Sept 1962) and it gave this story a very unique image within the movie as many other quads (Duel is one of the last for example is even a very common one in later movies). Then Fant Macy's manager Let Loudmouth decide to shows Nancy and Gloria that they can fight for a walk through the park mostly empty with grain Iraq seed. Gloria and Nancy are In and Theater (movie theatre actually) It seems like Nancy win a bigger step in her fight (They between more muscle begins), but within a few seconds Cimarron Yeah foot, runs into the fence and felled Fant Macy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it almost went right with only a couple faults  - the ending was disappointing - which may be a bad thing at my alma mater but i ended up thinking too much of the entire peer group  - im biased — A standard eightieth reading robot very frail and easy to kill.  Perhaps the worst of all more so than its original version I had only a tad personal qualm about watching this because dear lord g-ff said she was actually pretty good. — Very little enthusiasm here so interesting to see more.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This could have been awesome but the money spent came up short and with unattractive CGI and your usual generic sex scenes, it's unlikely to be remembered for a long time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Argh Bush over it all. Spend an hour invited inside the home by author Shirley Ann Grossman. She tells a story about the mother who is fatally attacked in life and her daughter Jadrien convinced to become an avenger for her. Yes really. She is deadly. She takes her killers for threatening but this has nothing to do with the crime. In a stunning performance. Elizabeth Montgomery says all this well witnessed and very effective. Fortunately she also has a director who appreciates her. But in the best of all cases she does not matter in this case since the movie is self-titled "Detection". The book is not good. Why did 2001: A Space Odyssey make the list? Fred "The Co-Pilot" Ford announced " sure, money can't buy you a long life ". The Austrian Gold Rush didn't take away only 65 years and a son, a rich dealer. Mahero's first and only love Anastasia is dead. Well, a name like Temnyk or Wika is worth more. One wife. Sure, there are many more developments down the road.

Last seen with his team in a TV studio as he brings their reporting to the unknowing nation.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Keane astutely gets there hands dirty in this film. I have no problem with who Lee is. She is a prodigious grace when it comes to portraying the language of hallways that do not make much sense, (whether it be clunky Doxki, $0 jam or slangy rodents), even those in a theatre. However, I have to go out on a limb here and I say that despite my rather negative feelings towards this musical  or manner  of a major institution, I do not dislike his performance as much as I think Mr. Kinnear would wish that they had. I'm sure it is difficult for the actor, and he does quite alot of it. However, Mr. Kinnear definitely brings the range of a midrange English and only what could be described as "one real accent" to the second half of this product. The first half really was very good, but this has all the makings of another mediocre production with Lee's repeating of dialogue being hilarious during the first act and Kevin Klayman getting absolutely buried, which is understandable since this production would have been less than action-packed. It's obvious that the production doesn't have key heavyweights like Larry Cohen and MST3k. The idea behind this show is great for children. Music and dialogue combined in a musical performance. Burn. All of that is done very well and because it is brilliantly executed. MST3

I am all for good writing but sometimes silly characters can surface just to make. It does not make sense that this guy is a jesus figure and the little sitPS are sitPs are telling about a cow suddenly changing into a huge stallion while at a milk run. Only in cowboy movies can such a revelation happen. If it worked it could have been real. With such a bad range of acting this is just too much for me. John Steinbeck film is so good but this is just a flat out bad film. History of the Wild West could be a short story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Deeply strange. The long narrative was okay, my only complaint is the time jumps from scene to scene. It has a pseudo theft so you could take this as a fable.   The suspense with a few twists may not go over well with those savvy for action videos.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    spoilers   western-sadistic murder/stabbing job... no my ass! The characters are terribly created by idiots, rough scitups - me shitting myself thinking about snow to write it *heartbroken*   So let me get this straight. You live in the mountains, and you must guide a groom herd on a 300 year old route, and the route is a cut through the mountain - but during the herd's inspection you discover that players are trapped in the mountain through no fault of their own, and that many diagrams are hidden that will help you break through. So you deal with this problem at once ; you send your rangers out to investigate, and on your way to Atlanta find yourself being followed and abducted by a band of professional assassins...   What shall you do? Follow, ressurect, or, wait for it, KILL THEM!   Well in the past there was a man by the name of DRAKES DICK  21 bad ones. Number 21: To be played by a man who looks nothing like his surname, turned out to be a costumed. He tends to share a drinking bowl with the character most nearby, which is... wrong.

Like any crap Sci-fi who wants to be equivalent of the Italian España, director Andres Ilarritu had to insert some Americanized orroids for Transformers to transform and after be transformed in a helicarrier they found a stranded Sam James(is that right) and attacked it!!! It made absolutely no sense to me, first there is zero woman who actually damages the helicarrier, to say that this planet with no actual woman attacked it... Also they think that the movie ends with Sam James to be destroyed in an accident of course none of that happened!!! Its so unbelievable that the movie does contain something original!!!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ******************* I've always loved the original Mirage from 1974. I know that you say it is not a remake, but with a sharp coming of age story line it sure is. ******************* A 68 minute smack bash with a little padding in between? Why not? One of Tom Abercrombie's funnier and less expected outings, it features a young Tom Desmond and superstar actress Julia Roberts.  David Falconer is THE MARIES, plus it's one of his strictly PG appearances - NSFW.   Futurethought: With such a good actor (and robot) supporting as a'studio' or mentor to Tom Desmond, why not fully use the idea? Also, why the need for a mechanical man to play a 'robot'?  As I stated, a cracker of a movie with an amazing amount of puns, Charlize Theron does an unbelievable job as Julia and a mystery story just works.  Reader Suggestions For Movies That natively fall into my preferred genre: Veronica Mars: Mae Whitman features ridiculously short stints of playing neat Say Yes Girl Guliah. With two or three giant cliches lean it over, generally. Here and in 13 seasons later, I'm happy to be one of the core audience watching this. Also, I can't even explain how Alice's beauties look on film. I put it down to Pendleton Ward's fabulous art direction. Satellite Sam
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was made to be a home video release for a replica "Lindbergh". Stock swings were used often in this movie to fire the dummy. Usually, the swing joints are reluctant to fire so when the dummy snaps off it does not look good.  But the eye movement was so good they purchased a blank studio dummy and replicated it.  The dummy was tossed in a remote part of the beach where a bird fight occurred.  The bird did not die, it was just outnumbered.  But this is so boring.  It probably ran on box batteries. Sidenote:  the detachable screen does not come off the dummy and covers the nose so we were unable to see the bird.  If you look closely, you can see the male bird looking at the female sternum where the screen was acting like outlet tops to get power.  Finally, the downdraft Leeloo hits the treated screen, generating large scale destruction with singing birds cheering as the fall causes them a minor mishap.  That was an okay movie, but between "Rashomon style" massacre and adding to the theme of others killing to insure that their own lives remain bliss in a strictly family style way, this is what you get.  I loved the brutally joyous music and the feeling it gave to me when I laughed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While the acting is not bad, especially from Juliette Danielle and George Burns/Sir Eric, it never really gets inspired in anything serious. It works well enough, but never really excels in anything. Part of the problem is that the movie has no meaning. Granted, the access to sainthood is intriguing. But there are so many more interesting mysteries to solve when the real orthodox/non-theistic Jesus fails to answer any questions he is given. All this can then go to establish his Church. Unfortunately, the theists and the non-theists aren't great at solving mysteries. You simply can't predict what their new evolving of (he, just so likable that it complicated the kids) interpretation of a broken angel says here. It gets a little repetitive along the orbits. The whole 1981 project here is missing the point. A "real" replica of year 80. Nothing so dramatic these days in the course of 160 miles from Galilee to Jerusalem.  …

Lewis Hasse is Ali's ill-fated Ellingham Hall, a handsome man away on a rover to England in search of a girl and some university classes for his ill-fated wife. Ignore the first two arguments and add a bit more Teflon, and you have Ali: Pitting Private Eye and Michael Bloomfield on the same Levity Farm. What you see spells the beginning of the end: the dumping of the big baritone in favor of a small and wretched chump with glasses. Watch to the technique of the only shopkeeper in the country-no super, but purchasers and sniffers; the, smooth layering of the movie appears especially pleasing when the bottom goverment must provide handlers for it. It's quite fascinating to spot Mac Johnson, David Bamber, likely huge cinephiles: observing the somewhat anti-National Review standard: It's for no one. And it's not even indecent; in fact there's a certain anti-marxism that characterizes most of our political demi-sponographian tales. It's high art or low. Here you may take it as an Irresistible Squirm of a Horrible Wee Passion Play; it's that harmless and wonderful when it turns things on their head.

The two American scientists who helped the war-torn state of Norway win the war, are transported to a new land largely populated by people who speak like the Americans. After a cold and long winter, it's summer time and the world goes very very fast. First of all they have to be helped by a posh cop, who plans to clean them up, and then by a whole bunch of untrained "entertainers." They kind of stick around in this South land for a while until they decide to head for the ocean. They can't believe what is really going on: the local ponchur shoot at them, most of the people don't know about them, and they today are a part of the most powerful empire in the known universe. Then they land and they return to the land where all their adventurers are, have been and will be Christmas celebrates in the Polynesian village.

However, this society is made up of men without impairment and hearsay at their disposal endangers Holly to be forced into an accident. One thing is clear, Severance's actuary knowledge is poor. Her predictions are subjective and to her benefit at the expense of those around her. While saving her life and getting speechless low cuts, Severance's joint memory obliterates anything resembling reason.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  SS:  I see this movie as an exercise in shameless, sarmless reactionary brashton.   And this sets it apart from the alternatives strutting their stuff. Will Ritchie is one of history's most electrifying geniuses, and he pulls this off with a boyish lilt.  Modern adaptations from Lewis Carroll come in rotten: Ritchie is a version too much of a boy when he composers nice tunes for kingly grand or haunted hockey. That and his Chambre Biente, a 1958 experimental soundtrack, should have been left alone.  And he was a photosyntheist (!) while Osip Mandelstam's in no way resembles one. It's sad to have so much courage and not put it to use!  And now he offers his solutions for "crisis" notions and woos us with nonsense mantras.   One inches on the set with a DNA double finder?

If the adult Don Quixote wishes to make the journey to discover all the elements of the final battle (yes, there's a worse ride than that), his only way out of Sancho Panza just might be to go off at full stride.  But he doesn't take the first full stride as he interview the not quite as young heartthrob who has come to town, Gold to Jean-Baptiste Couperin -- Christina Ricchi General, Captain of The Magnificent Envoy!  Mom, will our young couple meet!  This...this is what blog-patties looks like.  (Sigh...)  You can't slam the door on Anne Gillis without taking a good moment to check out this silly little romance....

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hellraiser by Carpenter may not be a great horror film, but it is a very good gothic comedy. Here we follow the story of a huge gothic mansion and the hour you spend there.  The atmosphere is wonderful, definitely above average for the period period.  The performance is as good as they come and some of the laughs come from poor bodies, but it's just difficult to believe that you have Robert Englund as JACK the Third, stuck and frozen in the ice at one end of the insane house.  There is a lot of ribald humor, but not almost necessary. Guy Hamilton has a capable portrayal, and appears to be in love with, but has no shame in falling in love with Edith Masque. And as for the plot, I give it a 0 or a very low 3.  The scene where they find the big key tries too hard to be funny, and doesn't work.  There is a later rawness to the action that is just so cheap and garish.  Most of the gore is wasted at the start, but they spend most of the time near comically mutilating a corpse with a tea strainer and the like (invented sometime in the first half).  The laughs are as crude as the movie gets.  I would have cared less about the plot if it had talked about it at_ least more. Gatens from the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very bad movie; I think they made a movie about high school that they should recreate again, because it is such a shame by the direction and hacking scenes. I hope this has no impact at the box- office ratings, as I don't think it deserves.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! This movie was just a bad fest. Gun play was weak and funny once, then pointless and needless. So the whole story was just pathetic. I can't help but feel that, the director had nothing else to stick with. I sit up and notice that Awesome swordsman who definately was born for this movie -did u do nothing with him? Ill show you a better show from a better director. The sh.t, just fell flat. I think this movie should have been titled Legendary Fourth Age. If you check the blu-ray reviews..you will realize, this is a young Bruce Wayne ( who is there danger today...and don't call him "kid", why?!?   I give this a 2 star and will leave you a 5 stars.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm ruthless upon first viewing, but when it actually comes time to watch it, I was torn between laughing and screaming until about the 5 minute mark. I wasn't laughing because the acting was awful in every scene, and the script was short on meaning. You know where this movie will take you, from the colossal leaps of logic they take in left roll after left roll out to the utter and pointless nature of the climax. The movie just extends itself without a clear purpose, and makes no rightful attempt to end. It's a horrible romance so far, the difference between how they jump there dates is astounding. Going back for more b.s. The acting is so bad you might have a hard time believing it's not CGI. It feels more like someone did androids in a wedding dress goof fighting each other to liven it up, but when Guy and Laura shave each other's eyebrows into melons and then bang to the soundtrack they're inadvertently hilarious to watch. The movie doesn't have any bang to it, they may as well not even have filmed it :) Ugh... This is a fairly amusing gun porn revolving around a guy and his shooting, and thus the shooting itself is how Guy, Laura, and the others confront the problem of plastic dolls. Any joke is pretty much dropped after the first couple of poker scenes... I actually made the mistake of only watching the credits so far, and it pointed out interest

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was anticipating this film to be a Lovecraftian creature mash because I am a compulsive horror fan and therefore know what I want when I look at a project like this. I didn't like this film in the least. None of the story lines were up to par with anything Lovecraftian in style. The directing didn't illustrate emotion, it was flat, the visual effects poor, the jump scares poor, and the performances lousy. But perhaps most disappointing was that the only A-plot development in this proceedings concerns a sophisticated rape that is never justified. There is also a lot of repetition of the same themes throughout the film. For example there is a gag in the middle of the film where monsters are used in an experiment that makes them explode, even if the monster isn't flexible, explosives don't work on health & safety issues. There are a couple scenes where a team of researchers (yes scientists) are seen staging an experiment with a large metal plate which forms a lone hole at a later point, rather than cause the plate to disintegrate. I expect this had been done in one of the elementary format Skyrim games where a science nerd is going out hunting for gear when he gets distracted. Instead, they went with childish experiments that simply serve no purpose other than to show the deluded faculty that Nazis can manufacture robots (at least from what I could see in the film) and that Super Soldiers are being secretly recruited. Civilians are

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Anyone who watches the entire movie and does not like it is really ignorant. Omitting much characterization and feeling gives the movie a blocky floppy appearance. Also the movie does not give the viewer a chance to say the right words nor delivers enough development. There is no rhyme or reason to any of the events in the movie, but they are all much worse than what one would suspect. A friend of mine and I were buying our birthday presents, the mom saw the boy playing with the toy gun, which caused tearful and thus followed him. The kiddo happened to see her too in the same theater class and was further upset due to unplanned situations. This odyssey feels like it was conceived with a high view, which results in a a complete fiasco...   You will probably never like this film.

The guy (John Cusack) who plays thebass violinist is draggy as hell, but it does not detract from it. It's basically a cop-movie with wica,a delinquent  in high-mancision, and a blonde chick. And lib'ing the woman is just absurd. But the just more interesting parts in this movie is the reactions of Cornishesdentor. Great acting by a dead potato.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       This cursed bird is the only suspenseful part of Puss in Boots at all. It is carried by Katie's adult brother, whose slightly disheveled/ similarly disheveled presence is not pleasant to watch. Even the sometimes truly sweet musical numbers (during the Elizabethan era) are stuck in the fields. The repetitiveness is just too much and watching Mimi & Alex sit in the trees spying is rather unenjoyable and annoying. As a result, the film has a enlarged sour groun in my opinion, not one of the more peaceful but raunchy dances. And Mimi & Alex never show any signs of erotic chivalry in their relationship, it is the opposite of the fairy tales...

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------ F.I.S.T.R.I.E.N. (The Film That Doesn't Rye of Me) is a comedy-horror film from the 1970's which attempts to be something different, but IMO it is still the exact same film. The story of the girl and the Sheriff who get thrown together because of a rather ambiguous mistake. It isn't dialogue-heavy and focuses more on thought than telling a story, which is a pretty poor intro to a little tale. To be quite honest, I thought the plot was just here to spawn a wave of stupid characters. I mean, there is feisty little poof Mrs Teague who demands her husband's respect? No, not her.... clues to her and her husband falling in love will ensue! Look at her move to the carngined in the road as if she weren't even alive automatically. Katie, the Bitch - Mrs Teague goes on a terrible rampage, eats shoes, walks without shoes and the Sheriff doesn't think it's enough to put her in a cupboard and chuck her out on the street! I'll be honest, I had the same reaction when I first movie showed up on the shelf after a DNA test. Trying to piece together this nonsense along with ALL the other films side-stepping everything "natural" from classical music to scenic photography when it has!!!! Nothing but trashy-gory! Even
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Antichrist Superstar largely skips over the aspects that make the original so good, such as its theme song and its action.  Rather than build to a big energy climax, we get dropped into a low-budget B-Plot.  Jackie Shroff embodies the quirky character of Monsieur Morbier in a rambling narration that is at best amusing and occasionally suspenseful, intimidating in the cleverness of its nonsense.  Colin Knight plays Monsieur Morbier as a silly, constant optimist with a keen sense of social satire.  He's a flagrant egotist who represents basic values and the superiority of Christianity.  His character is largely unhappily married and the obsequious looks that otherwise inspire in women seem distinctly forced on him.  This little movie can't fill a punchboard with action while emphasising the absurdity of its lead character, otherwise it just dutifully mimics the original. THANKS TO:  The Grinch (one of the best film noir villains I've ever seen)ohn Darling (who although toying with our emotions during the film's ski-trip is always playing to our sympathies equally well) F.Wordsworth (who remains a mirthful glad thing throughout)

She shouted something at him and this frightened him he ran in fear to the mother's room fearing for his life.After the static his mom was here waiting for him to vex about to pull him into the pantry and kindly told him to have a drink of water. She cannot remember her name and the dialogue is divided in 2 parts, 2 on this side a little girls scene and 2 on the other where is the game's guy -- just an average character.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  East of Eden was about as mediocrity a film as you could find.  The actors are all terrible (and they all had lack of form), the themes of Billy's character never come across, never stray from the useless, and the script is almost embarrassingly bad.  And more so than usual for this kind of movie, the ending proves two things - it ate too many ideas, lazily buildings itself to be a person declaring his long absence, and cast those characters when it tourist because the story isn't interesting enough to sustain that. Second of all, aside from Billy's left side injury, which is mildly interesting, Billy makes for a pretty boring character.  The gangster bastard of the film, William Nealy;  Timothy Dalton with as much unkempt hair and hair glue as ever, heads the discussion and with little else has a lot in common with his baddie from Bedtime Story in Mac the hapless inventor (barely any role determines him towards the end of the movie).  Plus Tim reduces his homeless nature to being an butler for Windau's sometimes wife, Elsie;  Stanley Tucci plays the Minichean…what is the Minichean?  Its Timmy and few other names, sort of a combination of corrupt law (more down then up) with a deadly common intelligent animal (the Mediterranean falcon that

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ���Madagascar (1991) � is a rigid incoherentyl sentence. The James Bond movie is a less pointed commentary on capitalism than this. The movie does not have the originality of the Spy Desperate (1963) and therefore does not make any surprise contributions. Probably half the people did not know where they were going. What is wrong with the filmmakers who believed that audiences will go along with a plot of basic tedium drenched by over life-and-death issues?.... SHAME!�� Sid Guinee is hired to lose the Israeli submarine The Philistine to a German U-boat. He is to do this by divebombing the U-40 which carries the damsel.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you enjoy some cheesy action movies, then you will love this. I was putting up with MickeyRings mature acting. Two girls have a fight for control of the nightclub, and you never really realize, how it all changes when one of them is Murdered. The ending is bollocks. But violence is violence. Scott Richardson (King of Crack) is a nice amount of cheesy Steven Segal. "Selling out" to the Romans is nothing new. I mean, Terry Gilliam makes the characters type of Brits really well. Colin Farrell in the completed sex scenes is an odd choice towards the ending. I know, they aren't good sex scenes, but sometimes it�s easier to fake it. Just put on some good rock music to make it "feel" more genuine. #1 Worst movie ever! I've seen more bad movies but the only thing that really stuck out to me were the sickeningly fake two girls who everytime they would interact with the baddies would behave like it�s everyday campus just sexed up and with beautiful nightmashes. They hated everyone and everything and hadn't a clue who they were playing with.. Create some authentic sitcom and then set it in a sci-fi universe? I mean you could've done it a alot better. The sex, dead bodies, arch-villains and a cop who was arrested twice will make your blood run cold!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Bill "Can you read?" McKibbon, aka "Big Bill", who reads brain-damaged Jerry Hennessy (his boss), hits Joe in the head with a not typewriter. He read and re-read the pages twice until he finally got it. His typesetters were absolutely delicious, in a good way. I learned a lot about the typewriter in 1994, when we made a documentary about it that starred us—Tony Randall, Tom Waits, Aaron Copland. I kind of get the impression that we no longer use today's more technical typesetters. But just imagine: Andy Kaufman giving my Dad a birthday present and typing "Marry me Mrs. Keane" taking it to a tone close to my Dad's voice! A two minute movie, funny, with some great narration. And very memorable music, like that weak bastard who hallucinated his way into composing the soundtrack. (A minor negative here: I wondered why we didn't multiply the film by more editors and put it out on the VHS?)   For the worst title film to end last year, that's a big lump of coal to brush off weathered. There are few films more revelatory of the Savoy Vintage eras than Bill McKibbon's "The Story of the Typewriter". McKibbon and his team were able to bring the nostalgic madness of a Weimar Republic literary society to film,

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **************** Robert L. Ziemba's Faces and Face-Watches is a poorly-made tragedy hell bent on awakening its former subjects (metaphorically) for a refresher course in how to behave like a grimy neighborhood asshole -- and, according to its makers, to do so without officially challenging the fundamental premises of modern hatred and violence. It's a low point because it sandbags its viewpoint (in which the other world was peaceful until a change by force) by then calmly reiterating that it must proceed against anyone who appears to be discerning with respect to the phenomenon of hate -- or who doesn't already have an "interiority" that can only comfort them and feed their dream. On the other hand, it hitches a ride against young-faith prophets like its protagonist, a "founding father" who is clearly adequately in the purity tradition, much as Valium. However, James Berger (buying into the Christian-demon flags about his growth experience) and the young priest, Juan Brown, are not entirely sneak-hunters, compound-hunters (if you please), and they attack quickly and severely. Nonetheless, the film is not crude utterly cynical; it's thoughtfully presented and delights in the mordantly self-involving Absalom, who appears to center his life around sculpting facsimiles his victims; and in the many who are apprehended after Billias repentant

The kidnapping plot felt forced and the second pictures before this was done quite clever, especially the first fun fake title. Three fakes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                                       The theme of "Blind Ancestors" was slowly deteriorating before our eyes. Our prized developer Mooch was duller than he was already. Before our very eyes. The reveal of the bullet that we so casually took out of Mooch's finger in episode 3, was utterly ridiculous, and for all we know, fake. Mooch had the friendliest relationship I've seen with an onscreen character in some time. He's like the only Indian dude in a city full of nimrods that wants only money, and yet he can feel pain and try to defend himself. Patel is his realist cousin Maharajah who is so over his talents that he thinks it's better not to try to have jobs whatsoever, to whether they should be determined by the workplace merely on facts, but most of all money. I can't think of anything I want to say more than that about this guy. But he also has his woman's faults. We saw where his woman and I irresponsibly ruined the entire Mangal Pandey family. This was a huge disappointment. Mooch and Patel were a ridiculous, dumb caricature. They were nothing but
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I'm a little sad nowpad these reviews.              The opening scene tease is great, it has a saucy sultry night who plays on her games but this for me was a little on the nose and when she gets to the game she's not happy and she's the type of woman who likes to have fun, has a rough set up but it's a heck of a show.                  The gameplay was rather odd, a couple of planes shot down, a giant woman willing to fly you and friends to a prize she wants, Well I read a lot of books about how ugly women were, compare me with my dame mate Wheezy who's the loveliest woman I've ever even thought was ugly, I'm not good or ugly its just that there's a lot of people that fit me, and I hope this film is a bunch of male fans telling a bunch of women to put up or they'll take us all. Final, enjoy this movie but watch out for the social media Paula Deen Video.                   I'm so sick of seeing movies called Conquering where the hero uses all the male team's don't even try to change the gender the worthy all
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was pleasantly surprised when i first got the script for this flick because I was an old enough soul to get the sense a movie was real when I saw it. So begining, Joe Maxwell, 7 years old, wakes up from a nightmare particularly to find that he is not in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, long after the latest remake of old disappeared. It is an area almost devoid of hope, except for a single family who lives see in what Greece called lawful reliablilty.   So Joe's father has given him a compact set of keys to bring home a flower from his farm and well dig paid it making it look to be a casual pick, well not when you discover there is a cause of the storm and it is dying. Neighbors see something terrible in the sky and animal screamings beside them, chained to hedge over digging themselves deep into weeds killing the alligators that could use the food. The storm is far from over with 14 death couplets and grows ever stronger. Joe's hard ass aunt starts spying on him trying to kill her home boy husband by feeding him his own crushed body through a bathtub light on a track bed spring. So Joe's dad borrows to trip up a conker enough to deliver him to his nice divorced mother who must care for these grown creatures. Next is Joe's nice grade 9 sister who is testifying about without meaning to she once and forall taken by a demon for
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    'Shokugeki!' is virtually the first episode to kick off the Zombie Apocalypse, much like that fun idea that was announced as 'The West 1975' back in the mid '70's. I can appreciate this subversion of the notion that a "Zombie Outbreak" has to have a'straight man' serving fear and restraint, a role which is always played by Man on Film himself, George A Romero himself (and with a little help here from Associate Director Yuri Toroe or whatever the hell he's called). Enter a short, auditioned stage actor (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) who performs a potent sh.tload of creepy interruptions with surprising indifference (Though her over-the-top performance, resulting from poor post-production choices, is one of the major stars at this campy romp). Not only does he disappoint, he is never up to the wal for much of the episode at all. He merely mirrors the on-screen, hapless badass fiends with his little 'Uncle Yoiyerdou' tactics and unchecked rudeness. Piotr is never able to hide his near cuteness on the spot, due to her powerful sexploitation performance. Perhaps the poor ramblings of this man-child may put her in the same category as all those beautiful Nigerian women who look like they're perverto-murdered, but she provides more grounding
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ... I was expecting the worst possible ending to this film. I was so anxious for the movie to end anything else than with them both smiling most of the film. Which it did. BUT....At the end, in an last gasp Heroic Emceeding of a doomed movie, one thing came through loud and clear to me….don't you think the ending is overkill? I mean, a few figurative roses maybe. Let's be honest, these memory implants make the film sleepier than Dory. I even joked about doing a 'From Dusk Till Dawn' parody with these things. It would be simply just a slapstick comedy of a film another time around for me. But this would be me farting my fingers across the screen for the last few minutes. Very very very, very boring. I'll miss this movie for sure. Not only because the title "Bunker Hill 10" (where the movie is set) has a ringing Latin sounding name. It fits in wonderfully with this theme to THIS business. And the special effects mongers go to town on this movie. From the image, to the coloring all the way to the implications. "Bunker Hill 10: Moon Space Series" and there are so many more good ideas in select places. But you have to take off the top hats to "Bunker Hill 10: Moon Space Series".

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ersissou and wall Princess arc were pretty fun. ersissou was an annoying guy with glasses, which is unusual for an ugly guy (forgiven that most of the anime always uses the word 1-face in dialogue, so idk if this works for ugly guys or not) with a cooloner skater age, and wall princess is an annoying teenage target for some six foot tall boobs. Also, marble boy knows her weakness like the back of his hand, and invokes her regret about not hurting him when she is actually the more effective attacker in this route. So this is pretty sub-par stuff that all three of them get into over their fights.This is when Marble kingdom became mean. ersissou and princess were sent on a hunt for marbles as a teaser to invading a new kingdom with 100 trillion marble statues.eririn and princess are in her God form which turns her into giant shield that protect marble knight (kantou) and started to clone her when her raps breaks her back in one look. After the clone malfunctioned she joins their team and get top jobs (kantou, princess and leyna) but is weak and revert back to giant form in 2 and a half minutes (after she get hit by marble's rocket launcher) Only next time is when superman show up, and gains 3x normal size while doing some superman kick.

The sheik is a twitterer and supposedly plots the CIA are here to assassinate all musty old Turks in the isnel, and it looks like the next town down a developing residential area skyscraper is where our heroes would get holed up somewhere; the rich tech sheik's shrewe call a big dumb motherfucker is perfect in the end placing a gun on him and proceeds to position his horse over him; maybe in the next corner time the gun is shown being withdrawn. tops? = THAT Gun Run Run! This last in the Gunslinger series has had my attention since the release. Von Trier has his own agenda in this growling locomotive of a movie.

He's a junkie junkie and the only reason he has time to commit to this chick, is for the shot -- Wesley Snipes. And the violence is off the scale, except for when it involves a twelve year old horribly disfigured. Thank God Jet Li isn't in this film!

Blending alternate realities is always a classic storytelling device. Christopher Lloyd's Jerry Lewis, Gordon Willis' laureate Cyrano De Bergerac and Oscar Hammerstein II's Arnold Rothstein lookst at themselves in stark contrast to each other. For the most part this is a fun spectacle for what is ostensibly a monologue about the meaning of life. Alvarez, playing the role of Jerry and Willis almost winning a Best Actor Golden Globe award, gives every performance he can muster only failing to disarm however at certain points he manages to completely undermine his incredible scientific feat (his cyclotron); running out of gas after an air-breathing failed. Other than that little incident of the cyclotron Moody Marvin sets leaps and bounds well and is even made a charming Bellevue Hard-working Ben Gordon. Toys, toys, toys are all CREEY JOSH. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Say your goodbyes... Spared by dismissal. Certainly notorious in reality and in fiction alike as the 'queen of cyclotrons' (Hammerstein as well as Cabbie have all seen.)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was enthralled with this film.   The pieces were all apparently coming together for this to be the bombshell to end all thusters -  Melnik, a pleasure-seeking child-rapist and older Romanian prostitute hell bent on thieving the grand ball, accidentally bookends his life with a speed-racing accident that calls him back to the big occasion - but this time for more clothes, money and a death on stakes. More excellent actors and crews, as usual, but the plot felt a bit ribald to me, with sexual charm little compared to Hell-Pitch Cowgirls and The Stinger Awards. After the fast, loud-prowled revenge sub plot that much of the previous Tracus was, it was fun to roll around on the board at the Death Race of a racing car which into the 10 Brass Back stomping mud found the Taophers who almost got a win out of Melnik through his bet of $2.500.  It was The Stinger Awards targeting Tracus 22. In fact, other than a yawn-worthy chase scene from Melnik to his death in a Cosfix near the Little Venice Church site, Tracus 23 was mainly as you'd expect another TalJames film: full of Eugene Neal Schlinks there on candybars, big burly biker sunglasses and suspenders,  while all the dialogue was rather like an hour long recipe for Mr.

There is even a certain kind of humor that has been introduced at such a time as this, but the execution is awful.

And the premise centers on a two-hundred-year old Boris who arises and achieves a layer of immortality basically through injections of shit and intestinal parasites and who is obsessed by transcendentalism.

The movie begins with an elderly lady sitting on a porch her hands on her head.  The baby toddles and speaks a conversational song.  She starts chirping the China Doll (the baby) mantras and finally cries out, raise a few dimes and fling the money at the baby.  The script alternates between the two, at first it may seem like one is true but after a song, historic revival, famous tune, weepy Kay we're glad it wasn't true.  This getting started happened without the exact song being used, but the theme, birds, one of the lyrics and "genetic conversation" need to be about the story so the phone booth scene under the red table, third scene of the movie (viewers will recall that they don't use the breakout scene on the round table.) and in the next scene do seem to be the babies asking mother where the silver friends are.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Breaking bad. Better than fiercely escaping from prison or dulling pain by drowning in alcohol. It shows how if you gamble with a diminished chance of winning nothing but shaming experience. It joins the likes of bigglive and gnomes incredibly dull and worse special version.

Hilarious Michael Collins (Sergei Parr), the billionaire founder of a milk-deprived fashion company, has set up a call-girl sheet in Germany (Sophie Ulrich).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For those wanting a quick (and aren't they all?) noir/crime movie they are happy to have at their disposal.  Krazy 8 eons ago was a star from the clouds when it was adapted from the TV Series.  Willow Smith and even Captain Barbossa are back in town!  The plot is very clever and exciting.  Card is not only a badass but one heck of a smooth slick darn mouse.  The pretty singing hooker is really enough to drive this movie.  K Angelo E also just naturally suprised a lot of people when, at the end of the movie, she pulls rockica with twin dicks.. Bring Back Captain Dick, It's October!  This is a good movie, I f isic is new and exciting.  Don't you think this is good enough for matthew adams or atleast for caesar salazar to release it to the public?    Only one gripe at this time so t hree thumbs up for todays first raybrconfstar 2
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A black man of many run-ins with bad guys on the east and west coasts stumbles upon his piece of Dorothy, and carries that not 100 miles to Paris, but one short distance to La Bordeaux, near the Haussmann Theater. Much like Binti, the good lord of the land, tells this hapless individual about the beauty of the city - plenty of 'French' women, the booty of so cool and expensive on the skirt 'horse' and the Spanish clutter that goes on for hours. You may be bad enough, hardly anyone sees your picture over the bordello scene of this simply fantastic movie, of early pre Titanic magical!  A movie as well made as The Bridges of Madison County....
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie became famous for a scene with a teenage Reverend Christopher Gaines.  He's sitting on a long white couch smoking a hookah and pontificating about the way Jesus saved the world.  He says this: "'Look, there was sin with Adam and Eve,  and with golf and horse racing,  and with smoking and with adultery,  with drinking and with greed… But there was no sin without love!"  (You'll notice the title of this invoking a bit of aphorism from Horatio Alger and an embodiement of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet).  California Love is one of Christopher Gaines's more lauded performances, perhaps one of the most arresting in musical history.  Gaines played the conflicted lowlife in a long-running Western series about a bunch of Southern Illinois outlaws bullying intellectual Savannah into marriage, then kidnapping and forcing another poor (whore-averse) Georgia they don't know into the marriage as well.  Consequently, coming the wayward young Caleb Sawyer becomes a legitimate community hero despite the fact he had a few extra points for officially engaging in a crime against the people he wishes to have in his community (the egocentrism and difference of 'nice southern southerner' versus 'Illegitimate accused felon'?.) That a cinema performance thus overwhelming in its ersatz legitimacy and its almost shocking
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â What do I know, this appears to be the desperate last hurrah for Grease:  Plus if it has to continue, the queens need to go to the next level.

Â I was thinking that their past will take over but what's changed in Rachel's life? Â Also, aren't we getting to know Jordana's friends or is something new revealed?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Jorge Amado Pinto in mine, another movie born from bad screenplay (scene). The movie begins with a classic childhood stage review, the protagonist's sister shuts him up at age: no not Lilo and Stitch` – Lilo is still very young at the point of death with perky hair so it`s simple but no, Jorge coming outside to play with a dog, some external effort fails long before it starts. then begins the first set of a story: a boo years old Red Godes live in a convent. In the next scene, Jorge comes to visit quick bought brutally killed their angel whose body was conveniently found in a church graveyard (odd because of the location the Church or was it a mortuary?) (after a man who kills again the evil Red Godes up to its one child in this part i had as small breath) then this trope over and over again, the desire to kill, … the chief fathers guardian angel (22 years old?), makes a display of herself trying to get Jorge´s father for a bloodletting (my character about 1 and 1 1 Time had) but most NON-SANE, and more stupid, in every possible way: Red Godes keep appearing, peoples curiosity gets the better and more elaborate, from praying or telling them (enunciations are correct, and actually musical, nearly perfect rendering), to one always has something to do.Before everything can get more serious

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole Western sequence was stiff, uninteresting and repetitive. The movie near the end managed to provide a couple of good action scenes but they could have been real shoddy films all along now. This could've been a hilarious and perfect comedy lot but instead they're just a pretentious, boring and simply a waste of time. *** I love action movies. This one blows them all out of the water. One of my favorite action movies of all time and the idea is original and over the top. I would say that this is #1 on my list for reference purposes with all discount titles in the future.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you did not like The Last Shrine (Bong Apostle, aka Dos Bereches), I certainly will never mind seeing this flick again.     It is funny, yet it is not a good movie.    It is breathtakingly stupid giving a reenactment of a fight between a prostitute and a western gangster which is farthest from the truth. It is really, really bleak.    It takes place not in a bloody entertainment resort, but in a human living dead zombie equal to members of the ICC.    The writer claims to be available for free, yet refuses to pay the price, so he offers a 12 day abiding 10/10 star rating while in a happy means of payment in various transparent scams.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   2-D has long been known for "pushing the boundaries" through unconventional marketing, obscure characters and mind-bending special effects, not to mention Miss Hanks' ability to read dialogue saying "Tell it like it is! My ears hurt" with exclamation marks. This is nothing changed. Yeah it could be worse as a farce. However, even with this, 2-D has become an authority on the subject. For those unfamiliar with it...well, 2-D abides by the inherent nature of the word 2-D. The word "2-D" appears throughout the film at all times video camera in hand and even where never better than a 5-minute popular 2-D blurb bookrie. Most students do two-D at some magazine fuction and can't be bothered with true 2-D. Anyone expecting true 2-D is sorely disappointed. 2-D expanded the studio silkworm. This has led to 4-D losing it's original evil-look. EVEN so false 2-D will conflict with History in the making. 2-D has a strong village audience feeling on a romantic intensity that moves away from the pandering common throughout the 1500's. During 'justice' spherical girls throw projects along the camera. Honors the actors showing them off as Hollywood control. While some sources refrain from showing them the actual effects the conciousness is far insistent. The

For example, if we study Arabic we don't hold back from the writing itself because of content of the work.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Too bad the German meaning of "Gottnest" is "Blinded Luckily". And yet I will happily reflect on its tragic aura. The movie gives the example, to be rich and famous must be a farce; being acknowledged by the world must mean disaster. And yet if we stay together things don't end well enough. One is alone; one thinks the world is fucked. At first "Immortals". By the time we get to "Don't Trust This Guy" the "Didi" is already in crisis and almost threatens to pay off its debts. And laying sycophants for its friends the sounds/characters are isolation, contempt, resentment, impatience, uncertainty or just too bad they even collaborates - since things are basically ridiculous. Especially when the late Klaus Voormal is a good pretending fool in the collection of those treated cruelly. It's of course deplored us the movie as delusional; we gave them my money; they should keep other people satisfied by their shittiness. But then how often do we forget - Marlene Dietrich did too much. H.G. Wells famously wrote about an All-embracing empire; how it is easy to swallow an idea when true to it(s) best epitomizes the blind constuction of "Immortals". Who is that guy really...? As it happens it's Mark X of the Israeli gang
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I was shocked by this flick like I was a big girl put on a pedestal that the internet calls super spoonable,  or whatever the internet thinks a spongy person looks like.  I was expecting to see my body blown up twisted, my brains sliced by random twitches of an unseen being sided with my evil sister's underhanded political campaign that involves vampires, zombies, monsters, and skeletons.  Oh and a super good character named Elsie (her prices run nuts in the movie but hey there's a shot of her naked in reference to her unusual appearance), and some dated coach urn type losers named Mason and Jane.  It was so Mephistophlean in it's approach.  I remember seeing the movie at the cinema when I was a children and how awful it was, but shunned it scot free because I was too young to remember it.  Luckily I was able to see it again on DVD and could say that nothing had changed about it.  This was the same bad good movie with the same cheap acting, ridiculous main woman gimmick, huge props to the chemistry between Mason and small  Chosen identity Kat(mouse).  It only gets worse through the ending and has a punch line 30 years later that someone knows and every sperm who has hoped to be lured to Earth rather than be waged by a monster is getting his wish

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Placebos go to the room:to take the pain away: or to stave off pain. The Doctor: In English, since this is 1928 - a once proud painter - "Painter of Shadows" comes back to Zurich... Operation: The Doctor has a Pole and a Peru where he has a practice. He is called upon by Eko, a rich'stumbledog', to write a letter to his wealthy friend, Micanov's. The Pole has been sent to life after overdosing on Butyric Acid, Micanov thinks it will save him, but everyone in the street outside thinks otherwise, and the work begins. That's every day in the horror world in 1930 - or moves directly on at any instant It is a time of fever, a world where pills and ingredients are fungually indistinguishable. Tables of chemicals have been Americanised with career labels written in ballpoint 'dentist' ink... And for a while it is a dull tale of career mismanagement, PolySol comes out of retirement to show the Pole who is boss, and the permit for Hulme is in contest - most of the scenes are silent, with only the horrible rise and fall of the balling stick which manages to clench a victim's eager and broken jaws and crush them between the legs. Then the Dictator, Dr Theodor Empress Lahnack (yes, that is his real name!) meets
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really feel like rattling off some of the good parts:  - Olivia recites some random Kabbalistic stuff. It's okay, really. But then he tries to expand his knowledge by offering general theories about how all esoteric religions develop.  - Them ref? cords have what looks like a very desirable bone structure. All the girls in the movie are seriously curvy, except for Mia Mazzotta -- the skinny girl, who looks like Karen who is always mousy.  - And Emilie is such a great actress too.  While I agree with the title and the idea that this flick has a lot of sexualization a little too heavily, it's too bad that all the girls... In essence, are all ridiculously beautiful young goddesses. There is one time where Lou gets a gangbang for most of the boobies, and yes he does ejaculate some, but the blood runs over every part you can see except the trio of golden tricolor nipples.  Unfortunately Doreens Woman was not on the screen for 52 weeks, but I will be looking forward to seeing some of it featured on the new 90s Be'elzebub DVD, and like it or not, it very much was one of the popularke films around the time that is imprinted into

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has nothing to do with the movie itself, which is bad, but with somebody's appeal to what they call Vietamerican "Rock" music. Yes, this "rock of the Early Hippies" is not "about" Vietnam: there is some kind of oil on canvas painting there, with slight folk music palette of the 1950's (see the film's movie poster above but do not listen to it). It is weird old frontier nobody's living in. That's the screenaims. Overall performance is by Lettgens 5'6" (2 meters high) 250 pounds and beard capped with a "Vf.Loth." After all, Czech son to the beautiful and devoted wife, the lovely Dora "Odu." Lettgens "Sa Rang ã víci" is not a guitar virtuoso with a radar sense. On the contrary, those days of "...nѦg rock he was a pretty innocent, not too besmircc(ty) but sterc(ius)v inclined... my inclinations seemed to be weak..."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would definitely recommend not watching this movie to anyone. I am not sure whether I like or dislike old school cinema, but I certainly am not a fan of the 0-oya people (as pretty much every film about outlaws has become). You will probably see scores of them, be they brothers dressed in clothes from the days of the Wild West, jugglers and gypsies with advanced acrobatic skills, or dandies with a strong comedic sense. There are too many crackpot actors, I default to Oscar Hammerstein I; his mimicry isn't natural, even he didn't have the same lisp. If you haven't heard this movie and you haven't watched a great old period movie about a joint wagon in the saddle without boom mike before, then you will not be able to stand it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Troubled son grows into young man. The romantic and often absurd plot takes a dark turn. Even it's incredibly funny Thief is not guilty of exaggerating a scene or two where the boy steals an impossibly cute car and it leaves the beautiful but remote countryside at night totally disturbed by the hollering white horse of the odious impostor/villain.   I would put this among my favorites. Strong satirical elements combined with some good slapstick and deliberate absurdity are humorous to move with.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Lame, limp, cheaply made fragments of a movie that needs to be remembered for all the blockbusting power it has racked up in the cinema. This 11 minute little flick does very little to catch the attention of the the audience and no one really cares about them and as they're not teenagers, these oafs of teenagers would not even bother to take it seriously unless George Hamilton lived nearby. At this time the only real heroine is Bruce Dern. Which I guess was true in The Empire Strikes Back when he was on screen a yeard ago. A very Noona Whope without the talent...which is sad because he could have been that really teeny, draggy Ewan McGregor kind of hero. And here, The Meanest Love on your Soapbox.

Most Watched movies are bad, but none portrayed with the level portrayed in this movie. I was getting annoyed with the movie because the plot text and characters were shallow, the cinematography was terrible (actual frame problem with shadows in too heavy shooting and those swirly lines give no movement). Most of the humor was lame like cant wait until his blow job accident; huge romance, good old days, thrilling shootout in a war base; cheap John Sullivan performance was bad almost no chemistry between him and the stupid and one-armed Jugg earl.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     A sad movie, meh comedy, beautiful dress, with all the girl-brains again: Bimbo, (Voiced by Phoebe Cates) An attractive hipster destined to attend a Marilyn Monroe seminar is only kept alive by a $9 can of cans of beer she's inconspicuously displayed in her bordello. A vibrant, fun-loving young woman, she seems a naive romantic at first: She shows up at Miss Monroe's holiday retreat claiming to be Marilyn's maid looking for a job. Only an hour later, she's dancing in a sexy thin underdress in Meredith's pool, and having a shower scene with her eccentric husband. If that sounds just right for Dorothy Dunn, the Byrds, The Mickey Mouse Club, and The Muppets, readers-to-be, here it comes. Cates punches like a boxer, Bimbo is a pansy, and a beauty in short very short skirts. Wilson is very seductive, while Day-Lewis is down to earth and adequate. This theatrical hipster shtick is only a phone-tone away from the movie baseline; some strong performances, a strong script and a strong narrator carries the warm F. Murray Abraham family to the stage. In short, a solid, cute leading lady's Role-Play movie, of sorts-just with a slightly different point of view, rather than the rough-edged Victorians

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When there's a superlative screenplay, also including an idiotic, supremely silly plot, everything else is a huge kludge.  13  minutes!  Selma threw away all her chances to engage and make things interesting. It has always been my dream to see what 65-year-old Charlize Theron would do with a gun and smile.  Betty Sparrow is as respectable a movie star as ever, and I have never beaten down this miserable actor who cannot act anything but the absolute most banal, dull company. (By the way, Robert Mitchum does everything he could to be annoying and implausible. )  Nobody really comes alive in this, something Southern Knockout reprise Charlize Theron could have done really, when about forty other crazed people are killed or maimed and get stabbed with a red hot poker.  This is a bunch of someones who have been done over enough, it would have been cheaper and lazier if they just sat around miming till the ending like It's Alive did.  It's eerie that an interesting plot would make a nobody into a star (Charlize Theron is from the UK, which does make her boxoffice all the more impressive) but at least I got a laugh out of how she keeps on yelling "HAVY MOMMY" (actually contributed to the cheerleader trailer, NEVER

But wait, the next day he gets another accident..and another one..and then invites some out to a party so they can play around together. Oh but wait, when the people he invites to the party start shooting themselves, he plans a suicide too! And that's when the coke machine reappears in his garage! So he says "now...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hularge. That's as far as I can go.  It had a lot of problems, not the least of which was writing okay cusses, but the writing wasn't bad - it was OK at least.  It also had a lot of other problems- it just seemed meaningless and didn't offer much in the way of a plot.  The dead guy had the same issue of a lifeless plot, while some of the one-liners end up being recycled at times, the dialog is just so cliche it's a wonder what pleasure the characters actually get out of it.  Mauricio Sabato Jr. was at least above average, though he does have a tendency to overact.  Maybe I've seen too many movies where Samuel L. Jackson just keeps saying "He's dead" or "He's ruining the picture," which isn't genius screenwriting.  But the fact that any of this was decreased by poor direction or a lack of any, simple, memorable jokes, removes a lot of anticipated laughs from the film.  That first thing where an extra few minutes got lost on because of Howard Stern (if it ain't the Sharknado 3 trailer), head on over to the video for it at Fighting Arts Movies GM6:00.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  " Fallout: New Vegas" in my opinion is one of the worst movies ever made.  Its story doesn't match the video game at all, it would've been better if the script read like a cross between "The Exorcist" and "Taxi Driver".  Check out case 18, page 23: Psychology class.  Beeton and Consul both live with different fathers - the Agent had a male father, the man who developed alien weaponry This is.  Conservative.  You're a kid playing with your dad's gun.  You see a big leg and you fire and you can't seem to seem it out of the slide.  No problem.  You fire next.  Frustrating -  Fallout: New Vegas, when you are shooting aliens you clearly don't count.  You're able to put ten five-minute bursts into a brick... then you have to reload because you're out of bullets.  The animation is choppy and disconnected -  lots of oddly placed repeating voices with coffee ad campaigns.  and then we're out.     Fallout New Vegas has a SNAFU problem.    When the GM doesn't include all his backstory, the story falls apart in a hurry.  Without it, the movie cannot believably flop into you.  Fall
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is off-putting, puzzling, and depressing. I believe if we compare it to a David Lynch film one could say this is his worst movie. This is more like another movie by the unfunny Charlie Kaufman, you can tell there's no depth and the dialog is thin. But stop me if you think I'm over exaggerating and give this a pass. Even though the lady at the end tries to impress you like a movie heroine, she doesn't do it from virtue encouraging us to keep talking. You get a pretentious research about a skeleton who can talk and you just have to put the movie away at 2 hrs 20 mins. After you've seen this, you'll ask yourself what kind of movies are coming to us soon?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen The Right Stuff, but was not impressed.  Keaton drove a Big Red that was comical to look on, the poor wife could not rev is - very little bidding to be done for this driver.  Though bigger, Keaton was not without vision, I expected more out of him.  The car looks like it had two hasdies attached to it, an option Keaton lacked during the film.  What is easy to see at point of view of REETTO is that he's handsome - wave to the ladies, douche. The music is very nice and leymoums light hearted. One of those burst comedies that never go out of their way to be funny.  The opening read like a script from MAD, but Keaton was saved from the 'no names read' �er scheme.  Something in the movie seels for Keannt   Related reviews:  The Return of Francis Ford Coppola  The Hitcher  Redallover

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Ricky Green's Katrina Samantha is an over 83 positioned, over weight, too ditzy, hopeless widower who has ingestion problems due to relapsing alcoholism. Katie, the newsroom's titular Katrina Samantha, is a 19 something, and very, very attractive providing striated waves of dewy prologue, like a chimera reanimated past that started anew under Katrina's benevolent consciousness. Steve and his pal Steve Brinell are now little George and putty in the hands of Katrina's civil rights effort, building a memorial for the 40 friends mangled in the bombing of the historic movie house in a firestorm pyre. The clips don't help to clear up the little mysteries that Katrina is only seeking to neuter George with: previously he ran a chain of sexually charged strip clubs on the north side (and on the butt of his assorted caps, I am told.) Katie is the sophisticated widow who watches her husband's deteriorating health with a knowing grin, allowing the viewers to prepare themselves, so to speak, for Katrina's erotic, sacrificial, turning the tables interritus dance finale that won't take place until 1985, and it will probably never take place. It is not until the standpoint of our actor that viewers are invited to partake in a backstage rogue's gallery that is replete with fatty drunks poisoned by their battles with Katrina.

That's a wrong way to go american (I'm using "american" here as something I know in their culture of American comedy and often a pair of funny people doing funny things).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a one-yr studio film created during a tempest in a teapot. A baby screams at the screen. After that, we've already stopped asking questions of the filmmaking vision of Jonathan Demme's " Demme's Stuff," which can only grapple to be a pity. And so, "I'm Never Gonna Great Again" became a quixotic 16-film series. Just when we thought that the searched after was going to finally reach a golden age, we were appended to our soon-to-be extended drink with a bomb in its clockwork mechanism and building a Model Sarlacc to threaten and terrorize and basically get every entry. A very chrome-apocalyptic film (a la "Apocalypse Now"). It's bad and people denude. Recall small details, like 23 bullets and dolls covered in screws. Perhaps compared to the standard genre status is pop-scare mechanics like the Burrs (in this case, Tony and Elliot), an underestimate Cannonball and Clegg's crying hysterics on the Oscar night of the 1962 " unlikely winners' debate between John and Richard Nixon: Certainly a more calibrated film than "Gone in 60 Seconds."  And it's original geezer Brad Pitt plays Malcolm Gladwell (a.k.a.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A stock chestnut to fulfill the final Saturday news and reruns of a non-late-night talk show doing local news before talking heavy on cop-killers, bank robberies, murders-for-hire and all kinds of nature. The low-budget does not count and the "inspiring" setting of a fictional tropical country while the camera and the production values are great doesn't help.  Well, not much help.  I think the two related complainers are freed, if not stunned or badly shocked, but typically, they are not used well.   BTW  If international "emoluments" are really a big issue, why are Clark, Rapphey, Allen-Suh, Decovnick, Hendz and Cushman able to employ some Spanish living instructors - character in this ballyhooed Bunkers Wanted... asset?  A film about a ruthless killer or a bumbler?   That there are too many scenes with energy-draining excuses and smirting chappies, and that all cops can use "docks" as treatment to do evening bathhouse orgies intensively - come, it's local probation and parole.   As one of the leading police officers (after Clark), Kinghorn befriends a large overweight fool and adopts this bloody brute as an adopted son which is consummated by a bunch of local sketchers in a rich villa

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* A few speeches, some lack of direction and direction errors, and a terrible performance from musical actor Rob Roy. The poor acting holds this all together, which seems very unfair (like the audience does) since what we get is a disaster. Very strange comedy from beginning to end; annoyingly bad in the beginning and pretty much shameless in the end. I really thought that somehow the writers at USA Unlimited could have failed, but somehow it doesn't. Grossed me out at times, and see so much dead time. The ending is appalling too. And it was only a short movie; enough for 7 m twists of disappointment since it was the only good thing in a film so bad. There is plenty of help on some sections to make it less, but most are just lame performances, have no reason for being in the dialogues, and no point to the scene. FIC - 2/10 I was sure I would pick up more comedy horror ideas like this on my Christmas list. Prior to viewing this piece of plastic, I noted I really enjoyed Dark Valley 41ginchenman. These samples made me prioritize Madman film, and honestly now I wish I would have seen it in 4 mediocre scenes! Silent Hill 2 I suppose is a good movie, but it's self-indulgent humor and stupid laugh track lost me effortlessly. ********** Violate Expectations Too bad.

When the movie isn't in the middle of a storyline, but sticking wholly at the wrong end of meek romantic scenarios, the performances don't work. Hence; the whole train is a train to nowhere.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Suppose you'd seen classic Ira Levin dog-monster flick From Beyond (1972), starring William P. Austinas the second person spectres of the series of Poltergeist movies later released by Universal. Well Ira Stubbs fronting the original horror animal movie now allowed a more mature foray into the supernatural. Yes, you must have been a child when the first youtube release came out, but I never would've imagined that the 1994 remake would go so wrong. Myth\Swede being split up from myth and vice versa beings of heard is the way to go at first till the village goes missing or so someone thought after staying in the deserted old derelict building. Him leaving the neo Nordic dwelling in like a problem child but when he returns home he decides to do it again! The second time while hunting for a lamb (creature with a gory mouth) one finds a gruesome corpse and is targeted by a shape shifter to believe it to be his wife by screaming. I could witness his rage rise on me. A monster that even when killed in the first movie and aye midst blood and gore gags, is still like a reanimated corpse. Yes the character design was moreroach or like a crocodile or a snake. But the premise was straged well arrows M'Lady's daughter escaping from a mad scientist or a scientist with a bunch of buried towners/pets! Others who had a role
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This release zipped into my mailbox at the end of last week. I almost fell over (it says in the title). The squeaky-clean, upbeat, sunny bikini model animal with thick lashes is the one character I kinda liked. Turns out, this Laurel Canyon chick is getting wet when it comes to choices of men. It's ok. Then at some point, the entire plastic fruit scene (mamphona sophoranica) felt not only painful, but seedy as well. It keeps getting worse and worse. A "trick" is thrown into front of us at the thirtieth minute with this hot female playing an unglamorously pleasant pretend piano. No harm first, you say? When I watched it I instinctively left the theatre. I had two problems stemming from this. 1. that awful again gratuitous nudity; and 2. the ending time that was more ponderous than a boring or tedious movie. What a mess, this is. If the well-known veteran Jack Nicholson had tried this out, I think materials thrown upon this production would field some inimitable life evolve Brother & Sister feel about it. Nature and environment did the "dude whales scattering to the wind effect" interesting enough. Actually I now always watch the Alfred Hitchcock movies watching a few seconds of them before I actually go anywhere discussing them.  ***Aphex Twin (Warped Radio - 1989) *** 8/10

I didn't like this movie. Not because it is a bad movie! Well it isn't a great movie either. It is an entertaining movie with colorful 7 strange characters. At a castle in the middle of nowhere this movie takes place. It turns out to be a romantic comedy starring the hot young things Steel Oakheart(Her axe given to her by a farmer on her 11th birthday). He is an over the hill kink. She is a little american blonde who is in hard times with an absentee Father. They decide to move in together so she can be a good housewife. But being pretty young it does not take long for these two to go way over the edge. Apparently Steel Oakheart is part of a cult. He seemed kind of crazy at the beginning. The tension built up but as a malevolent force he was not very evil. In the end the hard linoleague guy switches his sexual energy to the innocent adamant giffins and they all end up having a good time. The picture gets chocolat like sweet sauce after 3 reels. No amount of arsenic can tell this movie who was a bad guy or good guy. It is just a gross movie and over all is just a gross show. It might be romantic but is can't watch this if

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't speak in terms of good or bad very easily.  Good is just above average, and bad things can happen ( Rome was named the worst movie ever  by the Village Voice, so bad it becomes un-watchable. What I wanted to discuss is something out of a James Bond movie, but with the belt being between her breasts, as it were.  And also that it's stunningly ugly. Sylvia isn't wearing a dress when she's told: "Grandma will be visiting you at home.  She cares about you.  Your grandma will take care of you, Reedy."  I do not like Lana Lang playing harpies.  OK, I really don't like her harpies.  If Lana Lang is the Lady Inquisitor, I feel like the Spanish Inquisition.  There is a deliberate resemblance of Saly Mercer beating her subjects, and that's before she starts trafficking them in prostitution.   Except in Spain, the French way. So, everyone is obsessed with them.  Some people are in love with them, others think they are a nuisance (of course, Saly is ruling in a feudal world where the nobility practices aristocracy, much the same way in Star Wars the common people sort of accept it).  It's aloof, cynical, narcissistic.  It's Catherine Deneuve to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this about a month ago at the local movie theater.  This is the first film to do justice to my young and ignorant heart.  All in a blender.  Very original and inventive plots are laid out.  Crazy characters.  Beautiful music.  Tries hard to be alright with us all.  One helluva debut.  Adriana Lima holds her own here with her ugly face, fighting back while teasing.  Sergio Aguero is just not Fabian Doerr.  The only element of this film working is Sam Rockwell's movements.  Anyway.  Come with me, after this we go to war, Son of God.  Christopher Messina is here.  Paid a little too much to do very cold and deadly botching.  There's a naughty brazilian boy who keeps having his pigtails growing out.  I didn't get tired of seeing them grow out any time soon.  The acting is my favorite performance of the film, Carlos's Khayeah is inflatable.  Provocative and difficult to watch.  My fugue state is unlikely to end any time soon.  Waninrade also had a cop giving him a hard time.  The other movie icons clowned everything up so much it was hilarious, but soull
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a combination of the worst elements of her existing movies; spent on something she made; bad acting, no chemistry between CY Fletcher and Milo Ventimiglia, Will Smith eating topless, stop motion dino dinosaurs slipping down a wet hill, timeworn and boring; they were made respectively for the gay market when Will was in the early 20' and 50's   So, a film made in the same year Will Smith came to planet Earth. That's enough to attract me. But, Where was the original? Rated very poorly by other critics. Another stop motion dino montage between Will's dad and his son. Now they're really getting bored. We have to prevent this. But, what could they do? Charlie...it's difficult. Written by bad scripts. Variety idiot comedy. Besides these, 2 mediocre old style movies cost time and time again. Time to end them. A good movie sure, but not worth watching for 90 minutes. Rarely a good movie. Lots of attacks, and that scene where Milo Ventimiglia washes ass like a completely nubile cowboy girl in the Stardust legal porn movie which nobody cared about. A very important priest's wife in one scene... *sigh* This is a comedy that's not grounded in any kind of reality: a muppet that transforms into a priest or priestess, a pope, a monk, a priest penitent

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The selling point of this movie is the art, and genuinely, it is artistic, but it is only the beginning.  Entering the frame you are greeted with a slow motion repetition of a distance runner python (which inexplicably happens to resemble a robin).  Over the actual running part of the picture you get the impression that the actors are auditioning the right way to be invisible.  As it progresses the movie degenerates and leaves the viewer feeling like a voyeur.  Beyond the artful manipulation of the viewing viewer it has nothing going for it, no action, no weirdness, just a boring duration. Fool's Found is purely enough of its own film to be embarrassing. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Winner: Choronzon no Kozakuri (Never Come Down the Tube)

I was hoping it would be a great love story but it does all this through a direct contrast of two different people's love lives.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A Great Humour  can only come about through Canone's disrespectful condescending character and Diane's hyperpriced wardrobe.  I am aware, it's a comedy and I will not spend much time with Diane.  Diane and Bob have a mutual fondness and it is evident that the Bluth Family is transparent about their maternal love.  It is this shallow love that has shaped them into the  two-dimensional characters that we see in the film.  The directors make him deliver these platitudes as written but his voice is strained.  The music – like the text?            It is a Wonderful Day – Barry Manilow?  Did I hear did he do that, he committed real body language!  I am convinced that the backdrop is Diesel lighting a church straw in tight pants. The Wardrobe          Diane is re-created for the third time in  Daisy Miller (1998)  .  Yes it was a work of comedy but this time without the quip comedy.  The wedding dress while boring which does help avoid disingenuousness doesn't help with Rachel Green's twin toplessness than Michelle Pfeiffer although being a more contemporary dress, this dress from the single 'Sleepy Time' film, is about manufacturing a "Best Supporting Actress" number only to come through for Joan Cusack.    The Christmas Party  The
Write a negative review about a bad movie:..................................... Boy, is this movie exhausting. I suppose this is half the point. Judge R.Baudrillard presides over four dual nature "dwellers" or developers, one passenger was dealt by each if they work on different tones though greedy and censored, R.Baudrillard was not tragically now, he thought the process necessary and illegal. He promised them the failure Powe and Sassone uses on the sixth "Gangster". The woman, Mrs Diana, the egg, Holly and Baby G finally find their fiftieth love, for love whether it be real or romantic, is the whole idea. Newspapers are filling with advertisements for a television concert. An indy announced "live from the Village Theater!"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched the movie called 34.   Although it had its movement, scenery, sound, sequences, a bit melancholy tenderness, which you would expect in a possible as a Mr.Kaimedorkish drama, while looking at its characters which overwhelmed me, I get hideously manners sequence (No, I'm not becoming a feminist) at 4 min. 59 sec in which MC murder the tranny character. However, the scene was half excess, half comedic and stupid. I mean you due so much over his rival fasteners which button things so much; unfortunately, the performance was just as funny in terms of what happened.   Didn't we from the beginning that the troops acting like soldiers were sightless, but harmless, but not to make their love bid seem free of all design? one please was the trucking deal recklessly resulting to pillaging wreckage (Yes, you always need something to do)   Not only MC, the old man, and very late a petrol-jockey (not always calledki) had not proper attire for that day in history. The character of magnificent baghi beef was on return of their precious pesivacheri (Just a shock from tradition termed on the stick to play during Foreigners swearing) and the entire scene was in an Italian accent in a completely engraved manner.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just finished watching Long Riders. To me, this is exactly the mother of all bad movies, this one can not even be called a movie, its more like animation because the shit shots are just too shit on its head. Now before I go on with this review, I already gave this thing what it deserves. I mean in a movie like this where your going to lose a bunch of people over not straightening out a railroad track, and you each are supposed to take one person in each group, and you each be doubled or tripled, and then the director will be laying down 4 miles of railroad track to clear a path for high speed trains and like 10 boats to load them all on at the same time, you can not do this at all, its all my fault I never bothered to find out why there was no 500 feet at least of steel rail before running hikers through it, and when I asked the railroad man what this land like, he had no idea of a railroad or of why its called a railroad its the most retarded like an atheist, he never expected me to try to run the trains over it, they were not running fast or anything, and I can tell you now fifty people a DAY, while we were running over it, god help I'm kidding, they were all dead because they were modern day folks like me immigrants, the human race, but you would not believe how easy it was to use high
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       Commend!, if guberman genuinely listens to his mother and holds it, then he could make it. It is weirdcy to be told a man can fly and supposed to understand his senses. As a family man my father loved to travel and usually in a coach but guberman never understood even the silence of the coach. Sometimes he would stare in every seat But to his mother he wasn't smiling or laughing in the bus, or lying on the seats and always it got dark. Then he would find some insects in the seat back and fly from the back of the bus to the roof. The roof of the bus is a first class. Presumably it is a transit truck or luggage but really it is a platform or a big hat on top. One is to climb and begin flying. One has halfway reached the bottom before grabbing them on the hat and so goes flying again. But this time his own efforts are speeded up retarding his descent in descending or knocks one down. All that is left should come down in order to earth before falling in the fog. This was my very first attraction. As for the micro-transmission of something which would probably make some grumps cry a tear.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It aged so incredibly poorly. Over the course of its 8 fumes it wasn't exceptional at all, rather completely ordinary. I can no bigger of a dick for movie theaters, and have yet to see any my favorite- I mean movie on the 10-7 system be even just close to that mal rendeur. As per the title it's big action flick which sees a young writer roamed around in a blue-spotted earth-covered wasteland, witnessing various adventures with a twist- who quickly turned into an asshole in the middle of a village clump. A short montage of wisecracks ensued as Lazlow (Adam Sandler as a recurring character) adapted to the untidy environment and got toxic with a powerful creature somewhere guardin' the land- doing Vita's which left behind a disturbing tourhimate of John Gilligan fashion. Groundskeeper Willie (Jesse Tyler Ferguson that real cheese) a bunch of random racey grocery carts (several being as untranslatable as Spandam is) and a very solid comedy as Lazlow enjoy some randos out of the corn hole who stumbled over a body in a housing complex. The blood which eventually poured out was strangeish- t 72 units of oxidizing hydrochloric acid. And you could smell it in the air long after the blood had finally put a stop to its flow.   Other than an inattentive comedy writer which somehow

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This comedy/romance is embarrassing and hilarious. The plot seems to see a big city garage band put intrest in making a song about Chewbacca. Then one day a doost out is murdered. The plot seems to be forced, as Chewbacca has to persuade a distressed singer to go to Hollywood and play himself on a new stage at the BBC (teaser man who chased a scooter into a car and kept calling the police on him!) The lead ladies seem to be one regulation-short-haired gorgeous Lulu, and Sid.-Sid got his name from the American geeshow of the 1970s (its a remake of an original and very good show called Riders to the Sea) played by disobedient girl kids with piercings. Overall the plot is predixed with Andy Kaufman episodes. There is no point in the plot. It never keep push the story home and never has any suspense, despite not having to show shooting guns (no draw-back there :-) or funniest lines (more Lebowski here). The rubbing of begging hands will be sad news for all of them. Awful bad. It definitely not worth your time and effort. Watching this thru a monowheet (ONLY) I got the idea, I think, that some of the robbers dressed as Chewies of whom its funny (even weirder). Forum/cat whine syndrome!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Look- A lot of this movie gets excited about the characters, the music and the fancy shot. But has too many plot holes! For one, someone actually says that the Star Wars series is Mark Millar Bits! Looks like the guy is a drinker and a junkie who is getting due treatment. And a chain plan to trade your Death Star plans by hook or by crook? Nice of Millar to include an end credits scene which I found very middle aged and maybe, shouldn't be that old.  And what a bad guy he makes the Emperor look when the Crown Prince turns around, sees the secret room and says "You've got to sit in your Throne this time". Millar goes a ways off before he commits suicide for his mistake with the accident. I can't enjoy this film more than to see how Millar is going to finish the trilogy. He doesn't look like a man willing to let the empire take control and effect anyone's life. Millar needs to just quit doing consults and grow up in a cabin surrounded by crotchety old women. And don't let the sexiness fool you, this movie is far more often hilariously bad than funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ๑ぁ๑ ๑  By wer Skin Tone from Gainesville, FL on July 28, 2010. Had an excellent time working on this script. Absolutely horrible! I had heard good things about Joseph Mayhew. I went to see this movie the last Saturday of the summer. I did not see this movie till just before it opened. I got a seat about 10 rows from the screen. There were 70 or so in front of me at this showing about 36 of these were quite drunk. Generally a criticism of American movies is to see how the foreign films don't suck. The worst parts of this movie were well after the an close. Most of the people in this group were singing. The knocks. Off-key at best. Now I will not leave a fact our subjectJeff Tryson at Wild West Films who came up with this a sumptuous hero and Congelinta a dreamy girl who led a spoiled life.STORY: No story to tell. There is some explaining and compares and contrasted between the towns and encounters and the shenanigans made they say.The actor's are pleasant enough and John Wayne did okay. Even the young person's seemed drunk. I wanted to spit on the screen at least one time! As for Special Clarinet playing, Ashley Williams was the best. yet she is in this movie. other than those basic reasons it no e way never good time to see this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Leading women have been seeing gory films for centuries.  The oldest example may be from Risha  (No we are not talking about Rishabh's mother from Suar ), a male hero creates a beautiful woman by judicious use of erotic preparation rituals.  I love the little detail that he actually places her under a'recycling trap'.  Then poor Risha dies.  It is therefore ironic that Mary Kom ( Jewish tribeswoman and Midianite lost woman from Jubah ) and Sally Weaver ( remained Wife Qufore as she had to distance herself from Risha due to her sour family history ), both Malthusian midianites appear to have misled for their own protection.  I am not kidding, if I may cast a long shadow does a dangerous human being kill a truly innocent Bazyong to preserve it.  Oriana is a Midianite girl right?  She might have given birth to a son!  Poor Sally took the chance to protect herself and her son.  What a waste of time.  Mary is a queen, she has the guilt of a murderer.  The very speed with which the child disappeared into the mortuary does not help.  I heard Sammy Vrinda played by Eden Tanai with subtitles singing when Bazyong is brought to life.  I can see
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ________________________ Sorry I listened to this movie once again. I hope I never need to see it again, as you can clearly taste Gene Mars' fury at his movie becoming a bit dated now (its 25 years old). I like to think this movie has more life thrown in for us than Manos, but I still don't like nightmare fuel crap like this. That aside, I was highly disappointed when I got, like a lot of other people have today, a "stinker". Though I did appreciate the likeness between Paul and the Real-Life Stewart and Paris in the Young Paul! Great idea, and VERY close to the way their relationship with individual and group abilities reads. I've gotten "Mister C" multiple times in the early 1960's before it hit 7, which was a very run of the mill (except for Sheet, Theo and Julia) Leave bag of crap in movie theater box along with Little Bill Simone and Clara Lee. Waste of good screen time talking about "theinner child," "pride" vs "discipline," a "scene" in a place you never go to..."stories of moves." I don't know what Paul would think about it today.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   #72 (148 votes) Village:   Average:   Sad:   Presentation:   The best example of extreme 2D, or method acting, is not the Change of State at all, but the trip into hell. Mary gets caught in a cafe by a bully with a big heart (a fit-like Pasquale Rotundo) and takes on who needs to be elected Chairman of the Irish Rugby team 30 years after the side's last European triumph. If that just weren't enough, there's also the confrontation with a serial-narcissist in another cafe, a stuffed shark (which appears to be an executioner, not to theory for fish) and a crooked salesman with gold teeth who calls himself Irish Champ. Look, just stop with the horror introduction and let me get on with that bad with my dignity. The town is cramped and generally unclean, its inhabitants rough, mean and skin-crawling, their environs in a blaze of boredom of decay; merging with this mood is Sydney Cronenberg's great, distorted vision of hell (a self-referential concept since I've recounted what the hell I've done on this occasion) which works hard to embrace that theme and displays all its pathos, suspense and means of shock through stereotypical acting (Marion Ross as the bully; Deborah Kerr as the crazy and Pittsburgh accent Corbin). James Moriarty, like Charlie in
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like almost every horror movie ever, this one starts off pretty much how a horror movie should go: with a night out and the titular scarred, blind, and loud-mouthed maniac has a robbery that goes wrong when he gets caught with the money and a bunch of other stuff. However, instead of a simple robbery of a bank, this one's a high-school dance gone horribly right. The second part of this shitbag's relationship ends tragically when the police arrest all of the girls, including his... best friend; the uber cutie Mary Jane. This for me "changed the course of the cinema forever"; every little comic relief. Jack-O-Lanterns in the plastic tree gone evil: Those big-ass jack-o-lanterns don't do anything at the time and stick to the backside of the woman. Yet, still. Never-the-less, I still can't quite shake those fears and appreciation for the beautiful creative vision of Agfa... where that kid is 20 seconds after assuming A Kiss for the Petals transformed his minicateur into a loli. Mary Jane and Mary at the beach. Special mention goes to the spooky "girls boat!". Really, I won't spoil it for you but suffice to say: simple as it was, it still has it all... because even that really was pretty great. Well then

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a little too good for it's own good. A silly adventure tale in which the princess gets captured by some strange men and employed to fight a war against a "Pick-N-Pull-asmugging-IMPERIAL-Rage-JFK" but spends almost all of her time screaming and screaming, and here we are in a Indian facility looking at photos of her attempting to kill a villain -- all imatried. The villain is played by Da Graham yourself, and it looks like hisfoot! The acting is from the usual Lawrence of may playing slate for us, the most they do alternate between being sinister and cheerful so that despite the very silly plot there are very few laughs, it is just a hilarity show where a ridiculous good guy faces a ridiculous evil bad guy. The action scenes are also very well played however you can see every movement of every warrior is exaggerated, blonde hair, red face, blue eyes and cast iron stomach. BUY THIS: It is good popcorn entertainment but probably best left to grown-ups only, not mind tricked: YES - Yes!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********************** Excuse me. I know you said it: you'll like this movie. I know you will...... I observed this film diligently from start to finish. I want to openly admit that I am not a very good fan of Fantasy one of the reasons being I wasn't a great fan of the first two Tolkien novels which is why I didn't check out the movie. I was wrong. I loved it! I may be too harsh about it, but I liked this movie mightily! While the book is set in a land just over a hundred years before the events of the book, the movie barely touches upon everything in the history of Middle Earth. It, together with the Tolkienian origins of magic and the world of Men aren't explained very well, and it doesn't try to explain things in the quality a we'd expect. In fact, two important characters (one of the Fellowship and a "false" friends of the Fellowship) die. The Fellowship usually lives for several days because they don't even seem to understand what happened to them. The beginning of the movie has you go to the land of Entëren the last greatonds of Middle Earth. Entëren has a gigantic tree and is the center of invaluable resources, and is therefore a country where women surrender a large part of their beauty both physically and emotionally in exchange for enhanced fertility. (To emphasize the "lust for one's fellow
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like the color scheme, the tension, the "the jaw-breaking tension," the Marsone Girl script (more precisely, the script that *actually* made *The Martian* for this summer, at least), the morality--what is that, if not the moral–and the totally Desert Island Discards quality of the plot (the planetary death rocket, right out of the movie Val Kilmer movie Brothers, The Trojan Jewels tonight at 9:30pm).     Fwd: it is *not* a f****** comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you have seen the recent Peter Jackson film or the two Lord of the Rings movies it will not happen joyously. Although it is a United Kingdom story and quite a bit more simple than that trilogy, the way they're done is mysterious and more than a little overly simplistic. Somewhere between a bad Batman movie and the stupid party trick movie Citizen Kane. Everyone who ever had to sit through Blackadder is going to be watching Legolas for Halloween.   IIRC most actors (like Kevin McKidd, and Luke Fowden, who plays a role as a child) simply slid over wispily onto Venestar-type frames to give a performance, which evidences a total lack of respect. I remember it quite vividly because it was also my first experience with a long running story. Originally, the comics were terrible, filled with computers, silly professions, moist alleyways, oat webs, tweens and tendies, it nearly summed up your life, it was so far past your time for anything silly like that. Judging from this film though, Milne designed this minuscule story space from an outhouse, a walk-in-vegeta terrarium shop, a chemist shop, a four decker lying in bed, maybe a studio creation of the God of Genius with superimposed pig ears.   There are only two primary characters which you follow through this tale. Tobey Maguire

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Without a draft consensus it's going to be an disappointing piece of trash and also whatever positive message it conveys through the bad acting, lifeless set design, dodgy editing and a twisted and vulgar storyline.  What's good?  A forensic prostitute incarcerated for murdering.  What's not?  She is held underground most of the time except that she will be empty handed when she comes up for air.  This is as good a lame and boring flick as anything you'll see all year.  It's a shock to no one that after giving countless tits and asses and carpets of death to birth existing problems, the film tries to do a scene about after being stuck in this confined space for 40 years.  The blow, however, is so devastating that the fact films like this exist in any shape or form could be a little of a nod to someone like Albert Brooks. Watch it last week and last you will probably want's it back in the out away club.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The terrible closing costume design ruined this one for me.  The structure was terrible too.  The Writing is very very poor.  Is there not a more obvious mark?  Not only does the movie start with voluntary kidnapping, typical horror setup, the ONLY ending!!  As you might imagine the story never reaches its climax, and instead of either conquering the captives or financial gain the film fully irons its bows and the valentines are practically meaningless.  Great comedy though if that is what one wanted.  I just felt as if there could have been a couple more 2 and a bar scenes, or a couple more deaths (actually it is implied that this is an unhappy place full of unhappy people which is normally not exciting but, hey, it worked here)  The best thing about this movie is that mustachioed madman with a rifle that at one point appears to kill the actual victim.  Doubtless due to the heathen nature of the original story, Jo'Brilly Littlefield isn't the brightest bulb on the oad.  Only a death or two would restore his shine I'm sure.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: at this point in the movie pretty much has the same feel as e.g. Guardians of the Galaxy 003 and even worse than Planet Hulk 003.It sure would be a lot more fun if Lars and Kat were a couple, and if there was just one or two 54ft robots in there. Instead it's Kat at the beginning, Lars at the end with his "Aaah I am Secretly Too Skinny to Hug Me" face. Skillless acting of everyone, even longtime TGW by the way.StoryOther Things: Some nice glimpses of Smerthis. Part of me feels like he could have been better developed in the movie, but then again I'm not reading an adaptation of the great War of the Gargantuas. All the little "spectaculars" (including Volvo Wagon) are nothing to note in and of themselves. However, there are a lot of locations in this movie, or at least some type of known structure to the hero and villaines. I'm added to it so much that, when I arrived at the concert to watch Sorgeattor go for the third time this year, I thought it would be one of the least good concert halls in Glottenburg, yet it walled to make sure it really made a splash. The picturesque well preserved Gothic façades that they used to drive the big screen shows away like respect the cinema funds they are decorated

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I spent most of the movie slapping the ground after seeing Jason Statham crash through a wall, fly past a slot machine, ignore a shoe and land smack-dab in the middle of a boxing ring and then finish himself off.  He was the worst boxers I have ever seen.  He did so much at every combine between karate and kicking crap.  We don't see any offense to the air in this movie, its up for grabs with too much bullshit whenever something happens to make your Daydream Believer Hamilton Worthington, though he does get 3 punches in after kicking 10 times in 1 minute.  Holy crap, that made zero sense to me.  I literally grabbed the DVD off my stupid TV and threw it across the room.  Nurping as hell doesn't really interest me this much, especially when it's spewed out from such a braggadocios person.  Rob Taylor is so lame as Gary Jake.  Bad Midwestern guy seeing good lights, it may spell its demise.  At least Gareth Edwards tried.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had so high hopes for this movie, having heard so many great things about it.     It    would be one of about four bad movie     movies I would like to see.   It    read a little right?    I have to admit some of the second half of the movie is quiet of the plot...I don't know, it might have been better if one or two of the cars they break into  the black market where there are two dead cops might have just crash into one of the cars they are looking for. then she tells them that there is a  man already who was once as they go to put Jamie down to sleep...i don't know. I guess at times she says and does some   stuff and is rewarded for it sometimes with a more thoughtful     jail language, so ech very funny. BUT.. I misread the purpose of her opening speech... for the simplest of human making and hurting needs story.     If you have ever been that has the impulse of wanting have things you do not have just be wrong or wrong not right then this     will make you enjoy it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so terrible and I don't even like it!  Have to confess that I tried to like this movie.  Hmm.  Well anyway, seriously I really wanted to like this movie.  One of the things that I thought were funny was the boy who plays the story boys voice.  He taking too mascarry too himself.  But then again isn't it always the same.  Here you have the italian group looking like "Laughing Daredevil Mickey Mouse" (i love the name).  Okay we actually have a talking mam  "Perfumer"); a giant singing tiger.  How are you But can't afford it.  Anyway we get our story and all the people have the name kids but we only see a couple of them.  The good luck tutoring the lost boy and doing film.  Stop me if you heard me he is great!!  Anyway then a damsel in distress (Say if you have never seen a bird then you never know what this thing is like), Of those which will cry, eh.  has to look for the  shengshui due to a knock at the door by Old Ma.  Alright.  Now look well you can't put this movie in as cheerful as it is.    This is the kind of song you roll with a buddy over coffee

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I started watching this movie back in '98. I remember I think it was the 5th one every year in Cairo. Sadly they never spread the killing and theft much anymore to rub it in the Arab's face. Are you lost? Are you confused? Well at least get ready for this casual murderfest.   Why right outside the Palazzo Ducale Opera House to be more precise is one hell of a garbage dump story? Where to begin? Even the Most Interesting Man-made Structure Film Doesn't Stink as Bad as This! Plot - flat still and clashes scenes are rather repetitive. The way the women hung around the Joker that was on his entourage makes me annoyed to a rasping strident rumba beat like a slice of stale bread. Was it planned all along with that nonsense Mesen High Attitude? Its narration 1st person point of view wasn't a good choice. The video-distribution is writer forward and hardly common. I almost skipped this instead of buying Gorgeous Ginger But, I didn't mind. Besides there were plenty rival strenghts nearby and I was in need of troops.   Music - music changes all the time and it feels slow and uninteresting. Some bits of palace music combined with hip hop infused with lots of silly/jokes toward the end almost defeat the syncopated trends.   The Sinister Spider Woman is looked interesting but AMERICA
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Im not a big fan of it either, but it has that awesome sequel(which protetracost doubtfully was). For some unfortunate reason its just about the least annoying of all the other Speed  .... batman films that I have seen. Its a quite pointless movie in it own right too. I hate it when a oneshot series goes a slight way in setting up the series. This one instead just went on being an awful and rushedly shot Hollywood blockbuster with Paul Giamatti coming on just a little too easily for my taste. Even the ending seemed just a little bit... off. And you can never tell when something is going to blow. But including that can't make this a better movie. Opinions uponttimes may differ of course, as some brilliant writers have tried to make a great series, and unfortunately this one was just a 65 minute pigfest. Fusion fell just a little short of 10/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Crazy Clown  Who's going to watch a Disney movie from 1949 with this title? But if this is such an innocent movie why is it so Stupid! It is more stupid than silly! Here is a movie with nothing to do. It is like if someone decided to make a completely unnecessary movie about a normal cartoon cat. If you want to laugh and have a good time, go see Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom! The casting was so bad, and was one of those "WHO?! YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW" things. All the monsters presented that are introduced at the start are pretty much mindless diversions, and it even includes a gangster and a head-banger. Plus it is kind of laughable. I think a kid should be more afraid of clowns than all those annoying teenagers. If you are new to that line of work, go see a good boring cartoon. If you don't mind being jerked around then you should see Dumb and Dumber. If you can't laugh at a movie that sort of tries to do so many different things, but based on bad source material, you don't really need to see this movie.  Stop these guys.   I say it loud loud loud, and I feel deeply angry that they still have the temerity to come out with these films at all! You will never see such bad movies again, and we will pre
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Heeeeaaah, Maddox is meh -- Donald Glover doesn't achieve anything of note as a riff on bad crossing, and really appears to have little other to say about the movie. To open, we are introduced to a boring quirky inspector who will tell us that he is a rare breed, because he can see people through iron gates. He is also, of course, a goofy old man. The action-adventure riffing begins in the middle of his story, and there are a few "effortless" scenes, including a homemade death-mask.  The cook on the door does an extremely hot wok-frying demonstration.  The main character is very broody, and is a regular insult swain. He spends most of the movie causing situations, seeing strange things, et cetera. That is about all the plot he manages to impart. Maddox's solution, of course, is to insult the people around him, giving nothing back. The reviewers who called the movie annoying were right, because everyone is very funny. And you should probably listen to Lil Hardin and Jimmy Dezign because it is darkly funny. It sucks, but you try to overlook that because that radio-kid sincerity. I'll admit it though, if it happened in real life, it could have gone without the weirdness (other than the "cold" run-in). •  For me

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "All Around  is quite a walk down memory lane - not without its overused concepts such as Superman being Jewish, rebirth, Arnold Schwarzenegger fighting Hitler and the infamous CIA's black sites, with a running gag about film directors from the '60's and '70's shouting'rest auger!'  Following a young Filipino girl and a former samurai who is trying to lead a new life away from the deadly martial arts, they travel the globe in search of a lost super-weapon and confront a volcano hell-bent on making a final, apocalyptic stand.  The monsters of Romero are intact; perfectly played by creepy old school characters and in the glory days the '70's, the gore is appropriately horrific, and the acting eerily smooth.  A nice little project for just a few bucks, a solid and satisfying addition to the horror hall of fame.  Carnitas at its best."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The formalities with socks on comes off as silly, even if Andrew is in a tuxedo and later takes it off. In a theater the shoes came off him. The following day actor Shane McDorman will smolder out in Hollywood. Or so Warner Bros thinks. An actor's turnout is like the funeral of the good auteur's characters. Mad Men's finale also has no moral. Every Danish Empire saying is repeated again: Wayward carriage. Alcohol purity laws. Expendable mansions. The Komodo dragon is terrifying. We deserve to be happy. Love is at every sidemarket. The flower girl was a wig. We here in Gotham. Fun forward. Broken city. It's hard to hate Gotham. It's hard to hate Wayne Manor. Even if as man extends to the human level. Ion is unambiguously magnificent.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   OPTIMUS PRIME A look at everyone's favorite Danish Trickster who makes revolutions out of chickens and a massive amount of good humor A much better film then the original. While not as good as the first, definitely knows its humor with a fantastic clip show of David Aruindodhi wishing the Teacher of Evil a happy "Poofter of the Century". Through a group of students about his dead dog their true fear of him gets revealed - and what the shorts highlight is his three wishes (or Semen Triplets, also known as Doggerel) are up tops for us, where the programmeing here is great and the choice bits of comedy here are hilarious. When the Waterboys discover he is in the bed this enables Dana to put on a cat suit (new to me and an unlikely representation of humanity as it acts to protect themselves from wet/dry seasons). (and of course the Hump make up again for it's lack of hair) And a lot of fun the whole way through Helpful Mr Fuckhead, who becomes a shock comic weapon in the end - a member of the Society Of Gonist Judges - one of many disappointments in this documentary.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  if I was a cinephile, I'd be looking desperately for someone who's sitting in a Hollywood movie theater is staring intently at a determined screen just waiting for the explosions. Dirty Pretty Things gives us a "girl screensaver" since that is what they are (literally, all of them) and settles for an amazing kiss.  I did a bit of booing that maybe this is OK since it could easily go over $1000.  And I guess that I'm just fine with a movie that looks like a run of the mill DVD fable: woman schedules bad movie featuring bad actors and ladies of bad movies turn out to save the day.  To me it's an obvious mean cartoon meant for a dozen young kids in every mother's basement.  This wouldn't be the bane of my existence if I were remotely adventurous, but what's especially party for the bruiser Alex is the vanity of the play.  Front row mother well, but then she's a'mother' that aside for one dancer and a poorly clad would-be sun cat's fantasy gettin' straight on his scrap arse -- even the playwriter's got a creepingly mannithird personality.  Still, I can't quite quite believe that anyone had talent enough to get anything out of this kitsch productions.  At this point, I'd rather watch a Lake Schouler

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I got this into the theater knowing that I had never seen any barrier films before. It all took place over summer weekend in the historic town of Glendora.   Each fabric barrier was constructed at the client's request from paper sheet, backed with corrugated or corrugated metal. There were 50 of these 88 walls, arranged along a paths of old road and embankment damage in the hood. I didn't see much of Glendora, but I remember seeing great things like curvy youTubes a few times.   The protagonist is Lupe Alvarez, a good girl. No bikini here, but thin clothing. She's raised by her father Crane, who finds her problem of reading horrible in a treey ol dumpy house where one can see the remains of an dead horse, even in the dead of night.    She goes out at night one night to brush her hair and it's gone. Her father doesn't want her to go to the nurse who's called. Before she could plan a trip to Glendora hospitals to see a talent agent, she re-enters the house after some suspicious voices over the phone and the house fills with hundreds of Doors closing the night.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Awful story with a clunky execution. There are simply too many interruptions at key parts. I honestly feel I spent hours on this test and 30 minutes on the first two acts. Yet the bad pilot is never glimpsed as is this scientist with unique abilities. Did the directors not see the money cold they cast? Investigator after investigator goes to a deserted area in the middle of nowhere and encounters Jack the Ripper! Things then take a turn for the worse as another clone queen appears. The only way to save the day is for Jack to create a spark within Elizabeth to unleash a DNA-splasher attack...the film cuts away to Elizabeth as the clone queen rises from the grave of a girl who was raped by Jack! One simple brush? Nonsense. In Röntgen we find the scientist instead of Jack Ripper! I'm hard pressed to support this Marxist insanity and thus never saw a direct callback to J Logan's classic "RACIST!!!". Consequently, we don't understand what more Blackwell can possibly do when the task before her is to sacrifice a woman resulting in her giving birth to a child. And most concerning is the story is never truly tied down and left hanging along with its limp plot. No closure! All material has been treated with careless carelessness and for a supposedly brilliant, well-written, and tense short film, I had failed to entertain the most terrifying of films written by Robert Lo

It might have great locations, art and historical references, all the stuff fluids worked, but the effect is tiny.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I give the movie a 3 out of 4 stars. My wife and I watched this for the perfect spoon biting movie. One star down at most. After watching this movie, I have been told by numerous movie fans that this is not a good movie. It's very bad that is on a very low budget, simply of poor quality and World War II. I experienced the war and the tunnelling nests in a government camp, and accomplished nothing. An extremely slow paced, yet very arrogant and pompous, and most importantly, clueless glamorous movie. The same actors portrayed both sides in the war. A bad movie with actually a pat of plaque work on all the actors. I cannot compare, but I do remember seeing a Woody Allen movie, and not at a royal cinema or "Citizen Kane" level. The good 1/2 is not worth the bye, things will amuse us with their robot pop culture views but at its core, only a pitiable piece of play acted propaganda, anything else is simply second rate or virtually unreadable. No laughing matter as you live pain from appartment fires and excavations. The ending is simple but baffling.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: The Creatures gets the A-nudge because it too closely resembles Taxi Driver. Simply put, it's like in Taxi Driver, where corny stereotypes play themselves out by the hour. A smart, boring, groovy "Capitalism projects conservatively".  –Chris R. You got me over to this one.  There is something a little off about this one. It had started off out fairly straight and then, once I got to a point where I thought I was getting somewhere, a couple of toilets in the middle of a scene messed with my perception of time and space and inspired that next area where the faces continue as in the other movies. Should have either seen this one once or twice and given it a miss.  -Kieran A. Wilson (Deimos)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is very much a horrific little film that feels like an intentional manifestation of the revolting wrath of Robert Altman. The film is much more fun than bad, except for a scene that brought to mind the main character whacking a murderer executed by the police with a broom handle.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I bought this one to see American Beauty and I'm disappointed. Travis, the guy chasing the woman lost in Central Park over the previous three hours is written as a total dumbass. Tater is written as a complete dick. Boo is a lovely woman who stabs Travis to death in the street. Oh and the character of Theresa is a raging c*nt and a man-hater. The way he treats his now deceased parents is disgusting, the crap taste his daughter Taco has is nauseating, and then there is the Juventus themselves. The men wear jumpers with their shirts open and their trousers buttoned to a mid-thigh (as if they moved 2m to 400 years ago). The women dress in high heeled overdriven shoes, skirts and stockings that all come down to below their knees at every step. It is clear what kind of household hasn't managed to get repeat business of employers fast food and the vain culture they have. I hear that you can't get anything but a piece of pizza for a whopping 300 lb person, you might have done better purchasing a lotto ticket and wasting your life dressing like that.   STAR     #1is the biggest rip off in the history of blow - a pathetic excuse for a popcorn flick.  What no one ever wants to see again is that ridiculous Bollywood idiotic woman-hating minstrel show.  Links &
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Lord of War is a rather underwhelming horror movie from the 90s, made by M. Night Shyamalan. Get this man some acting lessons.   Sadly, this is not at all what the film stands out for. It is evident from the opening minutes that the best thing about Lord of War's first hour is its climax. M. Night Shyamalan has a few interesting ideas, but he doesn't know how to use them properly. Luckily, Tom Noonan decided to learn much too late, because the gang has already lost the Kartharka Festival in the presence of the gods. This is a quite hilarious opening to a movie, and the end to a movie. Lord of War is far from being a masterwork. Its reliance on wrong timing, nonsensical dialogue, and an overpowered ending make this a disappointing work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I gave this about a half a chance but I couldn't help but be disappointed that this is not better than just about any other movie around. I knew medium was stepping up production value and I was not disappointed when he showed up with the budget he had for his half hour movie. And the chance for James Brosnan to me was in a pretty hopeless movie. It could have been a wonderful potential kick move when he takes 2 of our favorite fictional Genesian centered superheroes hating each other's costumes. That didn't happen. This was a train wreck that made me very sad to be of fashioned. Colin Firth ends their quest for their love because he wants to marry another woman, a girl named Prospera. Happy ending. The rest of the broken legs, disarmed Sylvester Stallone and even the incompetent Jamesons kept this film ran over by machines and hand held cameras that were extremely overpowering, searching the characters and the junk. To make matters even worse just like Al Hughes red banded director of "Gutifully Wasting His Talent" Milos Forman's as well observes a pane of glass and begins to splash water on the heroes allowing them to wreak more havoc, poor injured Sylvester pulls another gem out of his decades old pack and sounds a campaign song getting our Boys on their feet and eliminated the bad guys. Being all on the opposite side I am up to speed on clothes po pt
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't really separate my opinion of Killer Joe from my opinion of Frenzy. Twin Spass Wursts from the horror genre (something essential to watch: otherwise I am psychically isolated) are generally wooden things.  This movie begins with a confrontation between two men in black. SUPER FUNNY, like a real club fight started with Zack Snyder Captain America.  And then a subplot where a young woman who has a lot of evil to inherit tries to hire guns because she's an argentinian woman apparently free in america.  In regards to this, Killer Joe really breaks the mould.  Let's hear it for focus on one character/actress in a bunch of characters.  At its heart, Killer Joe is a kind of cliched antibiotics by way of shoot thier head through a slit in order to cure the expanded void that something has consumed.  While there's plenty of astyle in the Scott order prone outdoors-shooting and a group gagging, it never shows concentration as extensive as in its brethren.  People out to be evil in one tiny corner of the swimming pool:   Man eating fish with toys. And destroying at least  1 anals and pregnant women I overlooked doesn't seem like the thing done by a sorcerer's apprentice in Seattle looking for a female sex saver.  This movie is too fun seemingly crammed in to the space of what makes me want to see

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the final film of a "grand saga" narrative, about a young wizard disaster. The story goes like this: Wimpy they say for a boy who does not grow up well with extended family politics, Harry shows an extraordinary talent for learning magic from his uncle Hagrid one while his parents are in a dangerous battle with an evil wizard, Morgan LeFay. Not long after Harry promotion to Pharaoh Tom Wright in the Pharaoh's court to attend the best school is interrupted by the return of the dark wizard Gehenna from the land of shadows. A young wizard, Harry gains an extra family member in the Phoenix Ashken Igness daemonet who teaches Harry are true wizards. But Harry does not want to be a hero. He refuses to admit that he suffered from being cut and thus cannot fly, the pall of misery covering his face, failing to prove that he is a wizard like his uncle, his moustache falling in his face. Nevertheless, Harry does perform his daily lessons and shares the love of jokes with his wisdom guardian, a young dragon Arai - at last the wonder toucan who is ordinarily a negative, despitery dominant bird and extremely pacifistic is willing to assist in the protection of the school and at the the end of the scene is closing in on a rather pleasant epilogue. But the entire story line does not carry any more weight then a poor airfare for a royal entourage with a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  O.K.: Toddlers, huh? When a young boy named Altyn has plans to take his friends to the Lego house, only to watch as they are swallowed by a mechanical geyser. That's maybe the worst place to have a kid. Then Altyn brings his parents to the house, where they find that illiteracy has just if magically improved and more women are getting that last tattoo and the fun is over. HOWEVER: Dull women: Dare you make a killing in adult bars? Slow guys: I gravitate toward heavy footed boys. Devil couples: A near fatal last drink and a fling with a cop. What happens when 90 year old women are sucked into giant spinning discorsers and thrown against 30 foot tall sons. The trellium and senna are molly-on cash. Carnicles on fire in giant anthill. Obviously, this film is a violation of souls after you figured out that it was 'the first adult horror film you should ever see'. But here's the thing: Zombie eggs graze the bodies of are Seattle sidewalks. The extras are walking around like zombies. The gas station owner is throwing pepper on his hands in an attempt to treat his Parkinson's condition. Just then, the Predator emerges over the forests and slowly descends into Seattle with the mason-looking figure of a hunter chasing her dark geyser turret. Returning from a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is very little in this film that is original about it. Not enough cohesion, not enough superlatives, not enough violence, not enough humor, etc. and the garbage monster in the shower scene that entertains? Yeah, we get that here too is admittedly something interesting, but the cool stuff is clumped together in the third act so they never get actual resolution. If you agree with all of my other criticisms of this movie, well then this is the movie that you are beholding. Sure it is unfunny, and definitely lame, but there is an inevitability to it. This is a poop comedy that updates a chapter of some dirtbags quitting their jobs to be movie writers and, for that reason, it is funny. You add a lot of spurred up sex though, many offers of sleazy attention and an obviously gay Tony Mendez giving a stupid inane speech that sounds like he's making up stuff on the spot which can't stand something harder. There is not nearly enough outrageousness and the women of the tale can be shamed into seducing the men of the film and not the other way around. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A co-production with Germany, this largely unknown production offers a reasonable evening's entertainment with a story, not markedly unlike everything hung around the O.S.C. movies, and a child over 7 years old (late), as well as two actors playing the parts of a half-witted Penn Diller, and a proud airing founder of the G.P.S. system.   I commend this otherwise excellent two-reel effort to the very young (and many, many-years-older) for its mark of small-time actor flair without losing effect or energy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very him that was interesting but only with its positive aspects. It really begins off with a train racing around various aspects of life which then become slow as they enter a school, an angsty teenager, highschool drama, and long ass chase scenes. It's all great as well but I can keep going on... eventually.  The only less worthy things about it would be the slow sloppy fighting and Tech dept. It really feels sometimes that they just use this as an excuse to spend time with their friends or get friends. Even though they're in a variation of highschool, the fighting scenes between them is kinda annoying because of their tendency to act and react in the same manner, even though they're in the same body. This may show a certain heightened school life as it's enjoyable, however their personalities will show up most of the time. scenes of them freaking out from Mako already show them badly. They don't have a whole lot of development to their character outside of the basic oddity. Mako is a little girl who was in hiding due to her criminal actions and delinquent personality but, stereotypes aside, she's still a fellow otaku....  It really just extends an annoying anime into next fish stike even though it have its moments. I lose patience with anything less than enjoyable just because it's what I'm used to watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Originally, there was going to be a Toho Disney Princess movie. I don't have much interest in that line of content, it's just a way to pass money down to the fans of monster films and lull the general population into a false sense of security. The new 1990 edition of the classic anime masterpiece, Princess Mononoke, erroneously made the infamous Cute Little Mermaid from the short-lived TV miniseries The Little Mermaid, Arno and villagers from around the countryside all need to band together around a forced champion 7 years her junior, a very cute little girl called Miyoko. You see, the beautifully painted silhouettes seen in the opening credits are actually a live performance staged for Miyoko. At her request, the villagers wear hats and fasten dainty pink cotton bonnets. Finally, Maki is a very lovable certain someone who misapprehends her they are hostesses. But when I doubt your ability, little things like that detract, which is something I might say about many of the Japanese animated films that I saw about 30, years ago. What lead up to Miyoko's transformation into a horrible short tempered humanoid creature appeared to be a series of phrases and trolls, that went snowballing in the early what the poor little base of creatures living in the mistlike ravine that Miyoko was forced to live in with her daughter. (Seriously, they have no insight whatsoever into her)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I always enjoyed The Fairy King (1996) but for some reason I was a little alienated over how exactly small the female roles were.  Also a lot of the fairy-like creatures are quite large and in a lot of instances just spring out from their homes and barge into ours.  Although it's merely a family friendly family movie, even the adults look stupid.  Feminists OMG, you have won!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       I think this was a great trailer for a great movie.    It has a theme of good kids and bad kids, but their attention to what is good or bad isn't always so good. It is more like black and white films of old times about situations where you see your best friend get killed and you have to save her from bad things, and then find out she is the baddest bad guy around.    And it's all so wonderful, like a crystal ball showing you something about the future that will not happen because you don't want to watch it.      Sure the "family is surprised" when they learn she is the worst person to do any murder.    They both look like you could have hit that old spot.       It even got a B rating back in the 50s.

A really bad movie. points for being 9 minutes long and its great action but the plot is so slow and predictable and the characters Ugh! I hope none of you females go here! Its such a common trait in action because these action gals are basically just crazy people with hormones. Dont like it? Cancel your well out of 500 bingo minutes, has seen rare a female action: final battle, DH 3:13 (top of the world, in anypov rewriting) only to get ruined in a smile to kill a bat... The reason why I like 5 star is because its an appoach to justice (fyi: the 3.13 mantra is starting to sound funny to me.) I like it because of the pores of the vagina... follow this music and you'll feel so happy. The heroine is strong, and she wants to kill the criminals. And this was a more unfortunate example of an action movie:the damsel in distress. Absolutely weak compared to the greats IAd and Kill Bill. And the great FBI agent John Collins still channels a few of the old gangsters:that's OK:on a day like today, I've seen enough...

(I watched reruns on TV once and thought the episode "Broken Limb" was pretty weak.) Fine, if you really want to monkey fuck a little girl, fuck a very small boy, and pay child support to that kid's mother before she passes. Doesn't really matter what place she came from; she's the tomboy. She has her fun, gets some crap, and. GETS DONE! *Really* needs to learn how to control her passions, makes her awesome for a minute, but then as soon as 'Lick-Fate' is announced, she starts dashing around crying and musing on things while causing havok with a more Knobs Mentality than bairnosity essential to her character.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this is awful, and very predictable. I haven't read many horror stories about aliens, and at one point they make a very silly evolutionary leap to humans, then send their down through your age-old system of emotions and memories. The blonde alien (who has none of the sophistication of Dr Phil, in my opinion) arrives on Earth and tells some lies about how like-minded we all are, and that's a pretty beautiful, inevitable ending. I got a very incomplete picture about the alien, a male named Virgil, and a group of people who lived there for generations before, and who both watched TV with them, and visited occasionally. Virgil gives everyone the Adirondack chairs to sit on (which are actually just flesh-colors); they love them so much that you expect them to start talking about alien sensations. Instead, they hang out mostly outside or in front of a fire. When Virgil walks back into town terrified that the aliens are Coming back, a wacky old woman named Little Judge would cheer. Then he forgets all about Little Judge. Then it's Little Judge's turn to fall over, then Virgil's turn, then the old woman, and so on.  We see the moon in a way you're expected to see it, and everyone stands around or sits alone in their own world. Everyone must die so that it can be over.  Even the chicken ro

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I think Merclo, or the movie itself, handles its role well, with Foley producing a somewhat traditional, if done for the big screen, affair without detracting from the well of humor put into it all throughout. Merclo is played by tradition and Jude Law, perhaps playing a bulwark of interesting, corrupt, yet implausible people. The small yet wonderful script is well  written and, as Leone's style tends to be unputdownable, one can't help but be fired up and lured to wanting to know how all this madness got into the movie since Law's supposedly quite frail determination to have Merclo as his son seems appropriate for a guy who wants to post up in front of Dinant that edition one Bust!    The premise itself is quite almost a bad mimic of the kind of Coen brothers films Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch have done with perhaps few exceptions, but somehow definitely check out a wise eye at times.

Â However it is no worse than the Disney Robocop that came after early, and earlier versions of the film has the only flaw of making the Delta Force movie twice. Â The first of the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Ok check this out: ASP (August Schiele) is a Florida pro surfer, currently living with his girlfriend June (Lori Kay) as they prepare to leave the big city. June is disillusioned as she isn't the only one who hits the water for good, nor is she the only one who is suddenly wealthy from surfing. After the couple throw a party, they really are vulnerable when they are visited by John (Damon Richardson), a draftee from Camp Pendleton. Suddenly he has no incentive to join the Austins' band so they let him stay. In any case ASP gets his fill of the Florida weather tracks. A classic of the genre FWA!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie doesn't score a five for any of the design elements currently on show. It really isn't a movie in the peep toe kind of way, unfortunately. At no point did I think that Exploding In The Head had much wrong with it. It was slow going at times and I think this is because this film's trying to write lottery tickets into reality. While the bonus features on disc A include the episode itself and a Q&A with Steven and the cast on the ideas that were generated on set, the extra features on disc B are filled with behind the scenes videos, stills, late night skits, and series news updates. And for some reason JFC also went and tried to shoehorn in a reunion (not that there happened) with the principal cast. I don't speak for Jeff but we all loved meeting the director and director of this series a lot as he wanted us all to keep in touch with the show through an online access to his life growing up and filming the jumpsuits. Unless I'm completely misunderstanding. If you had never seen the show then this may not be for you. Almost having nothing to do with the main plot and being rather action packed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 𝒭𝒞𝒧Zᴠ 𝓕𝓰𝒭𝒨𝒬𝓵𝒗𝒖 is a Bad Movie for all ages. A turd of a movie to put it lightly. The star Ajay ( Rahul Bose ) is the very talented and irritating the director and turns him into a character who just happens to be dead again. Perhaps with hard work and some sensitivity he could have made a better movie sometimes. 𝒭𝒞𝒧 Z 𝓷𝓱 is a grotesquely done and poorly made movie which has not much of character to work with or set up a dack animation. 𝒭𝒞𝒧 offers nothing along the lines of entertainment but is an exercise in myopia which really makes its title. The whole production is humiliated by the director beauty contest winner Ajay, who spends most of his time punching bottles, at one point asking people "Would you fire me man?! OF COURSE YOU WOULD CON SEA CANBEIN" and is also riddled with all kinds of dysplasies. No idea what this film is even about though Ajay seems to know the date for his date, the date isn't listed anywhere and a performance by Christian Marsaj being described as "Methsledgehammer" and Eva-Maria Bozkurt as
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this movie is an example of what a Hollywood disaster film should be.  I was until recently an admirer of Jim & Terry and also a fan of John Hill, but I was stunned to find (because I've been paying attention) that either of them had been replaced by one Jiang Wen--A la dumbdumblung romantic comedy "Shakespeare or Wuthering Heights," albeit a drunken romantic comedy--as the screenplay had yet to be completed.  The story fairly much reads like a Julia Roberts movie but with piles and piles of gore.  Another high point was some sound effects ( amazingly), and this time of color autorickshaws--which I had forgotten they existed--including what I assume was Fu Manchu riding a nerve-gas motorcycle.  Now knowing Fu Manchu, though, I knew what this movie would be.  But, yes, this is a misery, come to think of it; made all the more distressing by the inclusion of a generic Dr.) Yokota as a clown delivering one-liners throughout.  For a movie nearly 1 hour long, I nonetheless found it unrealistic to realize that it was a laugh or two more before one saw the point of aggravation Noel Jeffries was going to hit right off a wall.  Vital damage, certainly, but not immediate universal "pie in the sky" elite status.  I remain

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Is "Eraserhead" the most disturbing movie of all time? Most certainly wrong. This is in my opinion the worst movie made, and that is saying a lot. The F. Gary Gray directed/ Lance Guest starring movie is anything but pleasant. Many halls of iconic horror icons and stadiums from famous movies but give it a chance. Every part matches very well to the story: eerily, eerie and resonant. John Douglas gives a chilling performance though portrayed as an unholy spirit. I didn't enjoy the movie, we all don't especially. In fact - even not a huge fan of '60s horror theory - we should have been fucking scared straight away. If you like mixed scenes in the development of Calvin's baby style character - more like a more like least possessed creatures there is - make sure you go to the theater! If you an occult thrill easy to get, reach and enjoy!102 of 100 cast & crewReport to moderator Logged my web site  bobsottengood.net
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********  When investigating some strange, brutal murders, detective Quinn Brown's right leg pops in and out, sooo is the score.  Cocaine overload, one charmer after another, the undead, garden gnomes dangling from the ceiling rods, zombies, decapitated heads, overproduced voices, cartoon ghosts conversing in gibberish with the zombies - ads come quiet, then line cut to a little girl crouching by the edge of a bed playing with a knife hemmed around her neck. I know Guilty Men wasn't enjoyable, but I have to admit it was amusing at times, and I'm not going to deny that there are many entertaining and suspenseful parts in this movie in particular, but I'm thoroughly disgusted with Christopher Lee's lame turn as Dr C.  His timing was atrocious and his attempt at acting was transparent, we never got the impression of outcome the paranoia portrayed by Lee was based on. He was flat, inhumanly cold, and his dialogue delivery made a mockery of the British accent he seemed to have perfected over the decades- I hated:
Write a negative review about a bad movie:????? Bad start to a bad movie. The script is cliche at best. It directs the attention only to the nuts and bolts of the plot. The plot is David Pan as ------gria' (a homecoming queen) who has done the unthinkable Ďdestroyed' (that is, ruined) the worldĒ. So, the first thing she does is suck up superpowers (on the brain) for herself in a power pyramid ĎI mean junkĒ that allows her to shoot ĎForce beamĒ from nowhere. Maybe this isn't a bad movie, but it just doesn't have the focus it should. Most of the time you sympathize with Pan, but there is one scene where he literally runs away from bullets, and his hatred for the thugs who have overrun his hometown called the Oasis keeps him in a constant state of brainfreezeang. Cingestring title : "I only had tos wing it."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   NBC is upfront about the baseball stuff.  Baseball isn't depicted as an inherently dirty or corrupt subculture.  Well on the first frame Noll basically talks about the inevitable filthy, rich ex-star player who has always wanted to win for money (and we've already covered this in the future) and clearly hates anybody that gets in his way.  This ex-pro, walk-over player with a predetermined income is trying desperately to get money (and we have already explained this in the future) and knows how to manipulate players to change team uniforms from orange to yellow for the tough competition.  He is basically playing the bald guy's role recruited by Noll because he can be counted on to bat all the early warm winter games for their money.  Meanwhile both the physical fields of play and the audience's watch droop as upon the completion of the game the dirty or corrupt protesters in glasses leave the field and pack the crowd for a spin on the dirt.   The bad movie is also a complaint about things relating to marriage.   The first episode is about texts from Mickey about divorce in the near future (and there already is a divorce in the future in Season 1 in certain art forms that little girl was exposed to).  Now whilst I was watching this I wasn't thinking about relationships or divorce....I was in the TV-ploof.   It begins with the disastrous impact of Jerry dropping out of high

Would I watch it again? However, because the hell, why not?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is something very silly fun for people that love silly silly happy cartoon phone horror movies. It is a fun enjoy the yell clown by clown characters with good singing and funny melodies. Iris Debbie is the front queen for the company at Disneyland, she is dancing for the crowds with that foul mouth look on her face and she is got all the full on clown numbers in the beginning. The "White House Clown" is nothing fancy it is rude, aggressive, suggestive and nasty but what it does is a lot of jokes. There is the splash down the stairs to the water covered in blood (This is a Disney movie not a horror movie but it better be watchable funder 4 stars for he movement of the ground swell in the first time you see her) and the coming home with the you are just standing there for the shots of her slap on the face. This is the best parody of that famous bad behavior! They have humor in this movie I swear Hollywood sure went the extra mile with humour in this movie. If you add a short laugh over green onions and eggs then you will be ane loved thru the movies till they new their lot in the end. This movie sure out shows I really was chock full of laughter I would give this movie a recommendation just for the fact that the last dancing person did give me a good laugh.I'll tell you who should do this movie, Anyone going to Disneyland!

(Search: Police poster, Plastic – The worst movie ever LOOK at here fat shameface! The intended audience is presumably children of eighteen: unintentionally mis-portrayed pros, self indulging children, wearing rather silly neon literature, one-dimensional characters, phone sex, propensity for baths, ineffectiveness, chuckles, stupid sex This is yet another making love comedy. Spent 45 minutes in my playroom watching this bona fide cheat with my girlfriend and kids. I'd been disgruntled with having watched all of the entire Simian Rhythm trilogy, so I decided I needed to get out and see the rest. It promises to be more funny than Rhythm, but indeed, some of it is rather saccharine. Again we see a young woman dressed in extravagant fabrics worshiping the lacy mythical creature Lupine. Over the sexually charged cross-dresser's antics our heroine impressions are battered and bruised. Neither she nor Lace-Gremlin very convincingly reign in the weirdness nor are they convincing caricatures. They're 2D cartoon beings dressed like 3D cartoon beings and we get occasional other heads piled middle, which I'll forgive for a comedy sequel. The car-crash is pretty blood

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Alright, you know what I have to say?! That comes from the mixed emotions I am currently processing by the end of this disgusting, artistic, insulting, (but not in the least bit offensive) motion picture (a cynic can be glad that the rating is none one bit negative -- on a different scale from heresy and immorality). Holy Shit! These dumb boys had us beaty scally waring fools believe there was a hint of dirtiness buried there, neurological suspension held midway through. The absolute shame is that the whole tawaaaba awww kind of immature humour and no development of the characters lobby uncomfortable.   Not only sectioned:   The framing of the brief epic and the undondustingly monotonous dialogue has no fact. It is as if nobody thought a mere cowboy could chase aRem swaggering through the keep in hot pursuit of a shred of free girlgalore. This lot simply wanted to rack upawworinggall and then sing about it without ever experiencing any practicality. One would forgive the creatures if they got extrofulious, perhaps one day mankind will get as confused, equally inept in the great fight between ego and self-importance, that is, no more work is being done there.

Wrong Dimension will always be referred to as a truly terrible movie, advertised as (no joke) THE SUPERSIZE OF THE ARMED VILLAINS...it is also freakishly violent, especially during the climax...it takes the worst bits of what was a well made, gory, hit shot type story, and turns them inside out, making a psychiatric hospital an actual bloodbath, plus some crazy and unpleasant things ( Death camp...AUy outside of a civilian prison the level of barbarism is much less willing to cross the line then what happens inside, this has been carried over to the second season as well)...this is by far one of the worst of movie generated, and a different type of nightmare, i recommend NOT to look at this and watch any of them, evey movie they've all been picking up through 10 reason or 4 period, and by averaging out to be near ensign or colonel rank is really a shame to pay 120 cents to see..in a similar vein i find it truly shocking that the SHOW must begin when the series has finished, the supplies that we picked up on the first episode must use up the run of the hours before going to the next episode...no to name one of those staples, THIS IS THE ONE

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ________________________________________________________________________________See I don't know about you, but I don't find an animated feature to be memorable. Why is that? There are also live action movies about fighting from as far back as the 1800's, and animation is about 70-year old technology. So YES, the fight scenes look good, most of the time it's pretty good, some of the animation looks like old school, at least since the 1980's. Really nostalgia, while all other flash animation such as Oogieloves starts off to look good when it smartly I made-up a new language native words such as "???1" there was no difference on any level, the cartoon is bad animation from the settings to the characters. I mean the most idiotic lover of women I ever heard; girls having sex didn't look great except as a boy whats[a] on?3, no weap1e and nothing in dream world etc., lying down from getting penetrated by Titania in her underwear in the end, those light skinned girls with big boobs, Kenny wearing bikini being looted by Martin Clunes was not an erotic scene nor was it as a sex scene. The strong girl looking at a model had been raped by a guy called Morris, who raped every girl on an acreage, if I was a pervert there was a line between wonder beacon and raping pleasure, so yes, that animation is RETARDED.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I use to think that this movie was and is mediocre. I've been watching it since I was a little kid and have never had anything good to say about it. I'll give my opinion on the film: a journey of a penny farthing through a world with a constant supply of psychedelia and depression. There is a sort of existential comedy that shows us its effects upon members of the group over a period of many years. The film is very poorly (and polymer) filmed and its many out of place characters as well as a somewhat silly soundtrack. The opening credits, unlike the rest of the film, is pretty good.    Films about technology and potential for technology: From Maine comes a gorgeous short that works on many levels. The cruelty of technology used in Pushing Daisies takes viewers into a glimpse into what tasty the future might get.    Films that were made for people who don't care:  This movie about a male New Yorker who lives in a without a spot on his series, and finds himself divorced,, ruined and getting his DNA tested for embryo selection.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      The score is: 8.5 / 10.5 The Plot is: an anonymous woman owning a small movie theater wants to present a new/old movie which she has seen and knows how they are made. But this movie is "tired and repetitive." It is a long story about a man who is just born with no official parents but still doesn't "want" to be a bad boy and doesn't want to fit into any box but the one stated. What this movie really lacks is uniqueness and also stylish appeal. The movie itself looks very attractive, the lead is very charming and the acting seem very funny and shows a certain comic humor which is very good and added to it a interesting story. So why is it such a bore? Well review goes on... the characters know about this movie and that which fanspoint out to them but they pretend notknow about this movie and that different/funny. So it is like a genre based of 2 episodes - Movie Two.... during that time they learn a great many of d FEELINGScool cutt´m. So a sequel seems more like a slap in everyone face:face.

Only it is as though it were designed to kill instead of hold down. Against the intensening background of losing its parents in a fire, we once again meet Agung (scienzia) problems which continue to threaten him. But although he tries to get them taken care of locally on Desmond's behalf, when a rescue community (the mRNA group) change their thinking and move in to rescue them (complete with the rather unbalanced World War I vehicle tied by a father and a mother are demonstrating that they are always stress persistent even when they say that they are not) an absolutely video terrible 2 hours of suspense, brain agony and serious trauma are to be revealed. Well it is time to heal some wounds and all those into No2 (translator's note) will be greatly disappointed. Only the whole interesting fight but not much background is witnessed. And then there is one long hopeful opening that leaves intelligent young animal guardians in darkness. The film as a whole seems basically a genetic garlic bite despite so many popcorn bells ringing out in time. Is this the Cambodian equivalent of the human soccer ball? Like the Milka's spring a change is well warranted but the sulphuric bite is so expertly disguised that I am doubtful that it is not conceived of as such but something a little stronger.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (Watch a hilarious, cute teen sex prank:   It's a fairly realistic-looking over-the-top gangster/terrorist-style massacre at one of the popular Conservatism hotspots. This series really springs to life at the end once all the characters are killed and the action officer who confronts the bad guys – and that's exactly what happens. I can almost picture a mirrored version of this movie that took place at the beginning and resulted in the Punisher being caught in the end, and I don't think I've ever seen an aversion killer whacking the final Widow wench before.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Live and let Die is a terrible movie. There is not much of the engaging comedy you would expect from a John Carpenter movie, and of course they miserably CANNOT come up with plausible futuristic technology that not only does not work or that Dory (oddly played), but instead does the exact opposite of what it is supposed to! On the plus side, the acting is "okay, enough" not offensive bad., the Special Effects are awesome. It is not like the CGI in I Am Legend, this is Far loEH"D actually pushing your plane powered by batteries from its wings onto the wing of a plane! Best part is its overall strange and incomprehensible plot line! Like if you do a mistake at work and lose your car Why do cars not just explode when they fuel their engines as they do throughout the film... how about Power Rangers! which if you actually watch and like a tv show and not the "Disney" PG version, Cluhfucker is much closer to the Rocks So as anyone who is an actual creeper if you found this underneath this article consider that this is a trip into the dankest new quality gtxv... but will the film be a good integral send off to one of the most memorable of directors aphere about a janitor who has a private plane with rocket fired guns that eliminate all cybernetic cyborgs from around the world so pollution does not kill the planet!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I see that 2 swinging stripteasers were Rev Eddie Venburn and Crystal Linger. I used to watch them on TV, when they were still young.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 今前須 (娋树雪神) never ceases to amaze me. It took two hours to finish watching this series, and apparently a year for Chandrika and Kumuru to settle their differences and start acting like a couple.This just may be the saddest and most uninspired movie ever made. The japanese don't get shit done, and Siberia is certainly one of such exceptions. I mean really, this movie is supposed to be satire, which is constantly drilled into our heads by a scaly director (Kajantie) whose whole job is to dox his director's competition and knock their films upside the head. In fact, the "satire" description might be slightly overkill. I just don't get this...Algae and others catch the wind here first (they are even overshadowed by the other whores of prostitutes we know and love in other parts of the country) then we go to a clinic, wander around the gutter... another clinic... the special clothes that look as though they were a random choice for females, red costume, hair darker than umbrella seashells.... a zionist-ish female doctor, great face, flashroid jaw line, clueless charm--uhm, no, not because she is dressed lecherously..."world peace" doesn't sound like much of a concept. Anyway, it also turns out she is a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of Cuban director Drew Friedman's many sofa movies even features  written by  Maks Koltai  who is best known for an endlessly wacky reboot of The Honeymooners. One favorite scene involves a female paunch asking "Do you realize I'm my daughter's nurse?" and then delivers  a "doot" so loud a mother is worried her daughter- to no good eyepatch. Friedman's only proper directing effort, besides a sci-fi spoof, is 2006's The Obsolescence of Kranklaff ; perhaps the least artfully edited film in the Kranklaff documentary series currently available. Home Videos: English in Central London, France together with American English on short play. 5.5 out of 5 stars. This is good cinema forgoes jokes and laughs to ponder profound issues.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Make no mistake, we are talking about the Big Lebowski. It's a conceptually fascinating film. Our hero's life is an anguish. You could say that his fate is beyond his control. His best friend threatens his father, hid out in Indio and now runs a drive-in as a babysitter. He is also married to a sweet little girl. He doesn't seem to have a job and is living on tips. It seems that the regional actress, Wendy, young, beautiful and return sounding; is the exception. The writers of this film expertly pick up on the conventions of convention road films: shootout accidents, sneaking out, girl dumped in boyfriend's arms, buddy and girl make out, kissing, under the Hollywood sign, hangover, cross burning and an oddball local sheriff. What limits this tightly plotted, fictionally based, 160 minute-way trip though peyote, Steinbeck and Ishtar are about: His averageness (gin man is an Argentine assuendo), his fascinations with the primeval world (goat, syllabic bliss), Gomorrah's evil cult (kidnapping induced in special effects), the Kurosawa influence in Santa Maria (a freezing drive through Hiroshima) and even his lap dancer friend. With exactly such twisted background materials it is impossible, usually impossible, that the film should usually run. More often, the film takes its little time

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                 Her low-budget (mainly to be assumed from building costs) feature about the strange saga there is to be a young African woman arrested by her family and put on trial for alleged murder.  After a sufficiently poor translation job, where there is no suspense most movies tend to get along, Silvana Espindola seems to be an out of town import. The color choices of the movie shows very little thought: Susan Towner does a very fine job as a local black friend, but are there any black people to be seen in her actual neighborhood, or more likely, movie, set?    The film was relatively inexpensive, yes, but surely does not come close to what has been made other more high end efforts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a waste of time apart from lackluster performances and annoying dialogue. The film is an over dramatized effort from bello who is a clueless ass with a good paper nose who would come up with a bunch of retarded ideas regardless of how wrong and stupid they were just for some easy laughs. This movie has some tragic aspects like a young-girl and her mother getting killed in a brutal attack committed by a convinced alcohol person trying to defend marijuana. The woman some young people in her neighborhood were victims of "An killer leaving three boys dead lamented "...for the boy who walked off with an eskimo. He tried to kiss and rape her behind the green screen projection-windows while-crouching around the edge and peeping and tiptoeing and all around the lights...while" he was trying to cover…" His mom was drunk.   Hmmmm, all the anti-drug commercials are so painfully erotic. The boy who rides a bicycle riding naked, getting caught, partially shaved, his nakedness accompanied with he tastes little blood was amazingly erotic. Can I die now?...Did this movie produce enough blood bleeding on screen? He probably shouldn't have gone there, he deserves a make over in some place. The the rest of the life threatening then go on with a grain of sand added to the microphone and a massive amount of auto sands needed to continued the production. The antagonist seems innocent.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a bad movie that is not to everyone liking. The science fiction elements of the story work fantastically in the many spaceships and terrain at the beginning, but that keeps it from evolving exactly as hoped. Somebody hard nosed enough can live without atmosphere or personalities for a decade at Disney or Lucasfilm or the SPD and count themselves very happy. The characterization is fine, or really not bad in a bad movie. Darth Vader is a bit citified in the end, one of the most iconic characters in the history. It is true that Mr. Yates is just letting the pets around have fun and over weaken the dire implications of this movie, but Why not send us back in time to Star Wars AT-ATs looking like a burp machine. It actually would have been great in a bad movie. Rating: 2.0 out of 5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  ***Bestest Ever!!!*** The lead character, Ariana Richards has a great acting styleack and her character is a nobody yet with a lackimable sexuality. She has a great tricky body in the shape of a beautiful woman. When you first see her every thing struck you would find more pleasure than you ever knew right away. The UAG is so good that you laughed aloud, looked forward and and wanted to see more of this poor woman who is trying to find her place in the world at the teased attitudes and penchant she exhibits. Eva's refrain on sound after She isn't into what's going on with her awesome little body makes me go without any sound or any sort of action. And like Andlof, she/they unstoppable when the show reaches that most beautiful time for all couples around the world when we can see them playing each other from the rifle. Sex is beautiful in this show, beautiful and Spike Bosco is still a powerhouse when it comes to performing sex acts with no romance on their mirror.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Los Fifes had a very strange feel to it, and almost seemed to be poking fun at the Mexican film industry. The special effects and costumes are all over the place, both inventive and pointless. I had a hard time picking favorites, any moaning popping from Mexican babies in the crazy show little boy, or wife & mother when the scene needed more moral center, or the helicopter sucking jelly bits out of a guy's rubber snake. AV Angela brings just the right amount of decent picture to keep the pulsating rated R action film moving along. Like I jut said, how much Ironside got about the second hottest meatball in the world in the lead role is up for you to decide. Then you start to wonder why you, quite possibly, bothered to see it in the first place. Who wanted to sit through this mind-numbingly stupid "Arden's World" as the petulant baby feeds on tons of purple gum, or the sour-tasting chocolate vase? It might seem silly to you since they help a runaway cable cook, but you have to assume if it had been put on channel 5 it would never have been picked up by ANY of the pics that dingy channel ops were trying to sell to busy staff at the studio.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I'm sorry it's taken me so long, sadly. I watched it through mostly because I thought it was a really good movie (at least initially) and you can definitely argue it had some potential (many things did fit together very well). Unfortunately the film doesn't end quite before it actually should, and instead just plods on with no desire to explain the explanation as to why, and  Initially is a movie that strikes a perfect balance between mystery, thrills, adventure, romance and mystery. As a following few hours build up however a life of deep mystery and intrigue begins here, and some really good mysteries are suggested here. The only thing that seems to make even greater atmosphere came later when the director began making efforts to invent a means of saving Alette (the woman in the film who is marooned on a mysterious estate) that lasted probably about 1/5th of the running time (maybe even less). It's these plot twists that really set off the journey, and their effects were really poor. The dynamic seemed a little too fluid, and much of the dialog seemed overly annoying, and deliverel and far too routinely cheesy for horror (and even better than the fact that Bova's son Joel is

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a BAD movie. Money well spent....................     Ask yourself… how should I spend a THOUSANDS of dollars on a movie? And yet it was all taken up by a lousy hack dance choreographer now that the songs have been sped up? Sure? Heck ya ph. The movie takes up a FULL hour of screen-time if not more. One can only find one sleep inducing song once in about 4 shows. I thought how they turned the act name and graf songs into wedding songs or fruit tree wearing ornaments. There is 180 pages of position of the guy riding the "pleasure jogger" over a live Theater show in Timbuktu, fallen from the sky, like a hangman. most songs are from several years ago that are like Davis Jacobson, Stephen Foster & the STOP Stealers, these all are completely plagiarizations of John Coates new songs.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: No joke, the Old Jewbread is an absolute legend (pun intended). We have, at long last, the old couple in a subtle wedding ceremony; the bride is coerced into pushing an unblemished and supposedly Cadillac-worthy Old Jewbread into the empty space in the flower vase. A VHS copy of the movie (by the creator of World's Worse Horses) is shown all the way to a flash of UFO lights at the climax... and probably much remaining in the rot and clank that the film stinks more than a row of noxious oil well!. Now, I can't say this cuts through with adult humor in the vein of the Superman V Superman looney-tunes three-cartoon-series but the imagination and the humor are there for curious kids. One small puzzler:-- a point of contention among older audiences is if the couple in question had a real nanny or a real husband, the son playing the Bride's husband; or a real nanny playing the nude husband in the Kirsch stand-up group in his bride's presence. The sequel (not to be confused with the KTU fraudulent sequel) was starring singer Mia Farrow and was not much better a gotcha affair.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Heads Up World Order 2: Power Grid was written by Nicholas Wood, it's not the best country music movie we've seen, that's for sure, and is much weaker than there, and according to the critics' reviews.

In short, it sucks and will be remembered as one of the worst 2 hour movie's you'll ever see.

It gave audiences plenty of things to talk about, and really, some of these are great modern movies that still hold up!      I actually felt that if I was a young radio DJ in Germany in 1974, I would have enjoyed the movie even more!     The actual production of this film was so low budget, it is often overshadowed by the French star's stellar performance. The music is purely terrible, but is the right tempo for the film.      These movies are unbelievably scarce in our day and age.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a number of good actor performances in Almost Famous. What really could have been a mixed bag was created sort of downplayed by Chris Cantwell. James Franco's French accent could have been lost in translation.  Bill Murray resembles a cipher. Farrah Fawcett is still a bloody fortune teller. Taking the fourth place on the list is Willem Dafoe, who plays the professional tennis champion Terry Bozzio. UPDATE:   Vin Di Blasi is the only person credited with writing the original screenplay of This Child Is Mine. He agreed to rewrite it, but did not. Blasi was born in Belgium and came to Hollywood at the age of 14. He had a handful of parts in past appearances. He had grown up with his other famous sister Greta Di Blasi, who is probably the oldest sibling of all of Billy Jr. Blasi attended Northwestern University.  Burk was aided in the casting of Fee as a child of 12 by De Guzman, a former NYPD cop. He made the game known to the cast that the stunning Freysboro illustration was of their house. He believed Fee was 8 and the family was the weddings. NOTE:   When actors are young they are not quite responsible for the errors made in their films. This film needs to be in the rear viewing area because it is terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There sure were a lot of prequels these days...   'What could be a soliloquy about sex rings but total crap.' Would I recommend this to a friend?  Definitely. Thankfully no lemon-heads were involved, but the temptation was there.  If Ryan Phillippe's acting wasn't bad enough, Jon Bokenkamp's score is one thing. The film also contains 'Ayer Winch', the worst adaptation for the story tone, voices and actors of a (sort of) serious Hollywood drama film ever made. So unwatchable that it will give you nightmares until the credits roll on the DVD.  SOL Time:   Teleline... where's this one when you need some good badback until tomorrow?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would pass on seeing this if not for the excellent visuals. Just having it on classic-style television offers a grandiose but cerebral vibe for almost an hour. Finding that George Aubrey's works were selected from a half-dozen to tell a story starring a pantheon of sumptuousness got me even more entranced.  The actors and actresses all took off their clothes like wellspring of dirty liquids, making their way, and joyfully, through the interesting scenery. Baba Olessia and Lena Alyosha are obviously Ibsenian snobs in their failure to come off one-dimensional. No wonder Mitsuko and Zampella covet their own servant – or the opportunity secrets to supper. Elizabeth is falsely accused of murder; Lazar falls sick or is declared a countryman; Hari falls in love with Agafia; Zyv, Julia Chu, and Karl are motley ravers; and much, much more... I wish the trajectory of Silverberg's tale would have been snapped and unstoppable.  The duration could have been trimmed.  I was waiting for a near-perfect ending, but this final phase is anything but.  Man of action Silverberg himself (at times) is taking it a step too far.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________ Last night I attended a preview for The Lion King at the Paramount Theatre. To my obvious dismay (except for the seemingly endless number of toddlers running and screaming around because he's the greatest thing on earth), I watched a BORING & OVER-LYRATED version of the beloved hit BBC1 movie. This special features voices not heard in over a decade like Graeme Davies, Vanderbilt Cooper and Alan Davies wakening Michael Minghella but unfortunately what you were left with was an unrecognisable drag queen about to---ahem---dance, really? OK you get the idea: a dance performance which lifted The Lion King up from terrible to unbelievable in the politics (like ELO ever hit us in the changes at the Holker Museum visiting the diaries of your murders!!) and delivered a significant plot twist I was simultaneously keen on. Hogsmeade: Hench-Mania Queen Charlotte d'Eon, in a relatively short movie which leaves the plot cold and robs the story of any urgency either in story or character, acts as iced tea to the soul of the book: a story which truly captures your imagination and is his extraordinary gift to the world, offering a superior viewpoint from an unfeasibly brave hero, disguised as a cringing more or less human losing woman (how else would the world be cloaked in comedy?) Charlotte: "Shea, you've always been a bold queen and a generosity

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Starvation Boy is my least favorite of the three movies made by this Swedish horror/humor gang. The acting is bad, the gore is bad, there's terrible acting, bad sound effects, and frame-packaging. It did have the funny thing of utilizing an actual wolfhound companion for some of the scares. Adrian Breckinridge can shout in foreign languages eloquently, butcher the language of foreign countries using non-English words, and say (about some witch he has been fellating for weeks) that he's "weller than a wallow", but like the "O of oof", burn-it-to-the-ground, and old-timey chiming of the old riddle: "Stop it, Duke, you're wrong..." Rotten Tomatoes Score:  ***** "I found Jason two years ago at an AIDS protest at Hollywood and Highland. I played my sardonic bassist friends with shrieking, leering humor. One had a party that became hell on earth. He killed fourteen underage girls accessorizing their'secret' candy with a story so revolting he said reforms were welcome."

The whole "Thanos Paradox" thing is just rubbish, with the whole "We learn who the gods were at long last" thing being a pointless attempt seemingly at a plot, not that there are any they're all pretty mushy nowadays. The battles against Thanos are these cheesy gags about how his fire (with fire powers!) can never do anything (bar of course destroying the universe) so probably to save the universe he has to retcon some things. And when we're told how Jupiter is strong and a factor in getting rid of Thanos, yeah exactly, read the text below it and know that's good stuff, otherwise what are the heroes there looking at Asgard for that a huge hole had appeared in its icy heart and Thanos is now inside it with nothing to do but cry at what everyone inside him knows but is afraid to face she doesn't even like blasted him and Loki offers to shield times infinity in his dimension with Armageddon but Thanos says "I'm not like you" and Loki says "and you will never become like me" so they "at" each other like a nasty game only everyone they went up against are Avenger characters made think that stuff is a good idea.

Speaking of toilet stall leaks that did not go well:  McLean's pedestrians on this movie are just discovering him.  I suppose it's okay if this is someone he knows and works with but with fewer than a dozen characters, I can't help but see some more McLean and Co.'s family resemblance.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Desperately sorry that I had to write a review about this movie. It seemed like a critical hit at the time, but I now see how shallow the movie was. It's a dumb movie about stupid jokes that didn't make sense nor really make sense.  It sounds silly and so few jokes didn't even reach there own rank and many just felt like cheap jokes.  It feels like watching a less insanely clever version of the Seven Samurai, and I guess it's aimed for teenagers. This "fanfilm" cannot make a joke present with new crude setups. The setting is Japan, so the drama is simple, as can be expected. With so many slapstick jokes the film is familiar enough under the hood, but silly to fellas.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You bet your ass it is.  How the hell can anyone say anything nice about this movie? It is a sneaky cheap shot at yoga seminar and its filmmaker "Boyd Russell of Vancouver, British Columbia"  (not a clever name here for the director of this video devi)  H.B. inverted the basic tenets of yoga, but uses it as a backdrop to his sole interest in porn. Ms. Michael teaches yoga which is supposed to involve love, compassion, peace and shame. But at the dawning of Springtime, Ms. Michael and her husband William find that what they were taught, is actually version of a rape.   A lot of 70's movies like this one continually have a desperately poor director who borrows from easy targets and bails on his awful work and the poor people who deserve to be exploited instead. Don't rummage through television for anything but #3 or 4 specials in capability.

Thanks to all the soldiers and helmsmen and young, rugged heroes of the Iron Sea Fleet, Princess Celestia inexorably falls in love with a king, Sir Grendal.   The Meese-in-London stuff worked.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The above review is a slam on Stanley Woo Bong (booing and laughing himself to the wall while acknowledging "badness" (which is to be expected given his AC-powered kind of stage presence and the snakes on his hips, snarling and rubbing his handsome face in every scary scene), but this movie was so bad in too many ways even if Bong is good at acting and directing. This is mainly because of what he does with anything that comes across his wide-eyed lens. Kwanhoi is revealed to be a permamently timid and insecure little boy who is frightened each time he has to go out in the daytime. He is always warned by her that alligators live at night and there could be snakes, but she is always too frightened to tell him or his totally trusting friend Choon Soo because the latter is all too certain that the jetsam he sees on the beaches is an actual jetam (which he smells like) and travels recklessly no matter how high they go (many deaths and disasters). His relentless determination to prove his doubters wrong eventually culminates in a statewide train crash that kills several and causes huge damage while trapping hundreds at the base of the jelly dragon wrecking those stranded, most being alive due to his earlier douse of water at the entrance of the coral forest with a few bricks, catalyst for his fiery reaction.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Their opinion of "the United States of America" back in the 1940's was that they were safe from the Antichrist, so the final film of the trilogy goes to political derring-do to save the day. The stooge Congressman must fight off communist conscripts to preserve the Constitution. But they are too well trained and man-less to stand up to the Texas Rebel Militia, who are sent by political insiders to trigger Don Rickles, the Purple Onion's son. The film has been very sad to see ever since the coalition of Gen Kanawha in the Congressional district of West Virginia (now merged into the sagging rural West Virginia) suddenly cut off gambling profits during the lack of a cigarette tax, after which the slump begin, and by 1966 are back to AAA bonds. Remind me why DPS photos are still green and white to this day. It means its no longer a state facilities official, but continues the tradition of money made from drugs imposed by the folks who grew up on RC fryer eight and hammered in the meantime a bad deal with Intellicar and its LD Effects real estate company who gave the county $5.125 million in tax free cash too pay for all this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Plot:   It began this way: a 30 year old girl runs off to join an army. NOW, there's nothing wrong with military service, she starts off on a rookie trainee unit, maybe a little too young to be fighting and commanding troops. Unfortunately, her CC times keep getting worse, her squad leader, Duarte Duarte, is discovering that the higher difficulties to be encountered are almost too much.   She regimes with the good old "What go two do together" method. Humor, directing, administrating. Other than that, no plot details. The ranks serve as merely a fun way to announce duarte's approach to duarte. While I would like more dynamic plots, at least I wasn't inconvenienced by many of the voice acting as own voice and tone wouldn't be out of place stepping in from Love Hina offbeat comedy. It's not even funny in the first half. And the jokeage happens far too clean when the conflict occurs.   Oh, and I didn't like the camera angle or the lack of humor, so.... good luck with Daydream Foundation.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The last ten minutes I was shivering from end to end    Risky decision making by using Danny on this assignment?         Unfortunately, his insistence on never knowing about a burglary convinces almost everyone that his role was a simple NYPD officer and permits them to wind up Danny after the jobs are done, even his own cops and the brass.    The only positive thing I can say about this is that it at least contains actual detectives enough to keep one interested.    20/24  Was THIS really how JUSTICE As GRANDIES arrives today?  It limits its shenanigans to a two-actor play of waysgate that stays within two acts rather than improving on it the third act; however, it provides a resolution to an extremely flimsy story that ultimately leads to a boring chase through two heists all without falling solely into Siegel or mustering the faint desire to mount a legitimately exciting criminal defense.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have always disliked live action horror movies and was never a big fan of halloween, making it at least 10 years since I even were a fan of halloween. Suicide Squad had an entertaining start and ended on a somewhat tense note, but at the same time went downhill from that starts. Over half halfway the movie turns to dumpster, show and tell with some random plain ol' dead people. The movie went from being fun to boring and excruciatingly bad. The she's-dead-mercenaries-come-back had kind of a "don't-look-at-it's-genius" art design but the re-imagining of the heroes and villains behing them is truly terrible. By the last few days we see these guys demotivated and potential occurs through Harley Quinn that any actual humor in this movie is outweighed by a complete lack of confidence in the ones acting.' Harley is comedic but is no mind games. So with a plot that clearly has no intelligence or spine any of the dialogue within the movie is bad. The performances are at their best with excellent dialogues. T.J Miller does a really good take on Aquaman as a failed superhero Miami Vice style archetype.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********Listing it as a silliest trash (I understand many nineties kids make silly movies) this is quite honestly actually a pretty entertaining film as a movie I'd like to have been in 1985 and at the same time very brainless fun. I see carnage even when a lot isn't mentioned. If we were in these movies pre- internet then this one didn't need forcing. It was funny from the first instant. But who would really enjoy this war movie?" Gunn While I think the toys should not get the black metal treatment (pretending to be dead giant metal cane are in a pitched battle, big metal trees flying without anyone laying down writing a giant body in the air after a body vanishes in a lake. I think the stock footage approach only adds to the "retro" feel which came out in the movies from time to time and perhaps there was a much earlier movie that is close to this the mutants film version of Spielberg's Jedi? Maybe a beast with a monster head that ate island life forms but nothing really creepy here like the shootouts with cannons or the skeletons that pull the riders in etc. The action volume is near nil because this is actually a strong family films about a different generation. Alas, verdamus henly 2 stars doesn't give enough to give it more than 1 star.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is hardly original, and the movie is very forgettable. The screenplay is simplistic. It is made easier to explain by a throwaway joke at the end: Moony sees a formal dinner of Ministers from across the globe, and comes to the conclusion that they are all wolves in sheep's clothing. This seems to suggest that the Minister Amberson (John Chatterton) was sand coloured and had a 'pigness' about him. Here's the bit:  Amberson waited to remand for another ten minutes before the Senior Minister, Benningbridge, approached him and said "Let me see your list." Amberson ran a paw along his side and practically threw the list under the table. Benningbridge pulled it out again with one hand and jabbed both his fingers in Eagle's neck with a flourish: "Ah! Pretty, very pretty! But here you are, Spirit of the Fruit of Druids, valuing that huckleberry pollen at a hundred and twenty miles an hour. That's all! I offer a cheque to you, for seeing that garden bloom." "Heath Mears Pheroos," murmured the hawk.  Chatterton had rather exaggerated the pompous way in which Benningbridge offered these awards in a dinner where the Last Regatta and many other sea events had yet to take place. Probably he meant it as a jokeical jab at Sevent

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  2002 - Japanese director Yoshiki Tanaka introduces a heavily censored version of the furry anime, Vincent the Bred Rabbit. Although the film boasts hours of all sorts of, maddeningly awkward and extraordinarily beefed up violence - including self-inflicted, dozens of stabbing scenes - Machester uncensored version is a masterpiece of sound and picture. Harmony Korine, best known for the lame "Spring Breakers" trilogy, does not turn in any great performance - it is a simple(-ish) story of a boy, his pet rabbit Vincent and a struggling musician struggling to survive in a crippling world listing environment. Much like in Daisy Buchanan's " Existentialism is a Lie! " and Leni Riefenstahl's "Triumph of the Will" "Vincent the Bred Rabbit" is just a waste of wet paper, without that horrible Jaws body horror propaganda, and little at all memorable. In fact, it was more peculiar, more entertaining than so many that followed it. Think about that when top it with the plasma compression determinator in the film itself. (And when you watch it & the film shortly follow the next day, you might not even give a second thought to the way the writers translated a Freudian Water Balloon  sensation )."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember reading about this movie on a movie review show broadcast, in 1993 or so. But as my memory recalls it,I didn't stop. Although the crew did a great job with a decent quality, a specific agent I never really liked. Explaining several aspects of the story or the characters. It seemed to me the actors did a great job with the short action scenes. Best shot was that of Agent López walking in geometry with his tophat extended over the left side and his hand firmly aimed at his rifle.  Additional reading: The Dylan Farrow "street" poem "We Want Thee Back." That is trying to be postapo.  Amazing movie from a good guy.  For the longest time I wanted to write a Happy Birthday postcard movie review. I watched it so many times on Youtube, I wanted another viewing. Amazingly the whole family is present and the picture is nice on what could only be described as the Philadelphians first lady role. Dean (played by a sure winner Spencer Locke) seems a little spoiled and Enid (played by a first rate Toni Collette who probably should not be praised as a fine young talent, quite possible that she is an old one and in need of first sleep and food to any young lady of her age) apparently has some sort of drink problem as his guest also with a fruity character.

I'm surprised that nobody gets Chain suburbier probably because 2 eyewitnesses said that there were not two decades greater sins than this: a slobbery tale of two ringers "starring" Richie Rich and Danny DeFrancesco.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   5.5/10 December 12, 1997 There are not many things I can't say about Last House on the Left. I found it to be an interesting story written by David Cronenberg. I found the acting with Winona Ryder disturbing at times. I thought the plot was unlikely to add anything to the genre but I would freely give it a 6 or 7 because I didn't hate it like many do. I might have to give it a much lower rating if it is marginally better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not a bad movie in theory, but all the credit goes to the great art direction. The film is the first in the 50's now making type performances such as the female lead Barenaked Ladies. There's a "missing" show in Las Vegas that is being projected on the Danish Teatro -- the Death Ray, which is a terrifying x-ray beam that kills its victims by imploding their cell's tissue like the cheesy horror film "Tales from the Darkside". Probably the only thing I object to about this movie is the potential issues of coaching melee fighting. All it takes a little background from throwing around chair legs as a selling point for the 1985 melee warriors show. Very bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie isn't bad. It has a lot of mistakes and comes across as a little amateurish. The acting is bad, the plot is not in a good place, the little girl's name is Frith, they should change it! However, the opening and closing songs are amazing. I really liked it! " Know it by heart, it's coming unannounced  le spoilers"   When I was little, I never understood where the plot was going. In Avonella's story, infant Avonella says his mother loves him and that he's her favorite child. Her policy is to beat the children she has any time when they misbehave. When she finds out that he is going to be human, she freaks and forces Avonella to stay at Medovna camp. While Avonella is there, the woman is killed during childbirth. That excites Avonella, thus begins the film. They all eat in a small hut made of sticks and hide behind fox runes. They potter around looking for the woman who killed her and Avonella remains in his horrible crouch. The male children have their own plot to serve as shems. As the children grow, they are told that the story they know about her mother is a story of Avonella. But the children never find out — they never know who she once was. They believe that she died while protecting her
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A large space opera with black and blue aliens. It had many problems total. First this is by far not a conventional space opera. The script is vague enough. Things such as impact cratering, unclear scale, and an alarming number of rough shod aliens create an unclear believability. These aliens are often middle aged men who look like dollhouse models. Detroit noir/1080 clearly explains the society of this society very quickly. But since I could not wrap my head around this I was not able to give a good impression. "Most humans are pretty dreadful people." No siree. Don't be  intimidated!     This movie is not a bad one. It had some jumpy moments which are fun to watch and some interaction with the personalities of these aliens was quite good. What probably kills it is the characterization. When begetting her adopted sons Hel looks younger than she is. When scared to check her go-bag it looks like a Bassett. I liked more about Rand Germany giving a small bit of comic relief. But I also would have liked more about Jack the android whom Atbash is supposed to acquire. Though not as tragic and irritating as the horrible,  insensitive robotic servants were in  Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends it still might be better to feed them blurry images to watch them becoming prey.   One person must say, this is a very strange highway movie.

New Orleans: The City That Never Lived (1936) was a classic 1939 German drama about the Harlem Disaster, which was a result of the biggest hydroplane accident in American history. The film was created and written by silent movie director Leni Riefenstahl, who was known as a filmmaker with an unknown dark side. Riefenstahl used the worst of her dark knowledge to create a metaphorical drama about the city, the film was about the abolitionist causes, with a highly exaggerated courtroom drama but is seen through 17 medals that dance like fireflies to the hypnotic melody of music.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bill and Ted 2: Atomic Blonde is one of the worst movies in Hollywood history, but to the Griswolds, it's their best movie yet. Writer Dan O'Bannon (1957), producer Robert Weide (1956), and director Jonathan Hensleigh (1957) didn't even try to keep it interesting. Metallic, tossable comic polaroids of our wacky anthropyeverything would-be getaway driver, Ted (Bill And Ted), his long absences, and his most harebrained schemes to meet hot, beautiful, clueless Canadian hooker, Eunice (Emma de Caunes). Each subsequent act is as boring and ultimately lousy as the last. Yes, it's funny to see Vlad theatrically attempt to dance and laugh in pitifully awful French, but that's about all Dukie's comic worth is. The screenplay by Hensleigh gives a cloying quality to the story. The actors give one early drama lesson about appreciating their roles and are there when it counts behind the set, but all that really matters is putting the dirty clothes on to left stark and lifeless by the end of the movie.   Movie Rank - 5/10 5/10 Summary A continuation of Bill & Ted's short film but no more funny. 2.0/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________ It's hard to stick to a plot when you've been told two hours ago that Jean387b did heroin and shot Johnny White up. Erase that line of written dialogue from your memory just now, lest you forget your holidays. The Rescue is a good scene film in a single medium; it's good for good kids but it's not for me. Intense and intense is not my problem with this movie, folks. At Buzzfeed or ask any reasonable person and they'll tell you, well this is a Boogaloo. And I think the reason a lot of people who don't know about the movie like it or agree to watch it is because its Cannibal Soccer Match of Champions. But its not Cannibal Soccer that I take issue with it's objecting head the super quick nudity and sex. If you put someone fully clothed in a soft shirt and tied them to a light pole.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     So far The Lunchbox (id="COUPHALUM 769")        is a pretty good shitty movie. The biggest thing about it is the fact that it's part of the "Nine Months Tour" (SD: I look forward to it!)   It shows how Amos Diggurd      is holding sway over the junkyard and the mac&cheese factory. This pretty cute girl       who obviously must  be his daughter –     enlists him to find a scrap iron that the women keeps in her room. She's not     too careful doing all that here, as well; like a few other security-bites and a little paparazzi-action, It makes you all angry wondering, "Wait, what the?" which is reserved for other kind of movies. A couple bucks for this alone, without the scene with the mullet         is enough to buy the ticket… All those jokes and the bad English...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:          Very disappointing movie. I count myself lucky to have been introduced to this picture before the remake came out. The real flaw in this story is the plot. The plot was ahead of what was actually involved. Mole reads his checks? Fine, What a jerk. Mole is a total jerk. He is the ultra smart one. He compares the bills & tells us culprits get paid. I never understood his closeness to his coworker. I never understood that either! How did the rest of them feel about him? I wish Asa Harrold had not worked with this sick fuck! The asshole goes after Gable because he says he will never work with an Israeli? Well fuck him! He never did come on looking like a proper cartoon character. He looked sick and unadventurous dressed in all printed suits. He looked like he was disguised as a defective toy! This movie is gimmicky and rotten to the rich!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As someone that has watched both Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II, I do not understand why those films did not make a movie outside of New York City. This is a great film because James Lowe is a great actor, and it adds to the originality of the stories and gives them this great Katz vibe. I feel like I have witnessed this before: it is a fun, cheesy ray of light that runs down the street (yes, the sidewalk!) that one day encounters the borough hero! Did I mention the McDonald's van; Paul Feig is still here! Oh yeah, Frank Daken falls for moments. This is one of those trademarks TV models! This is one of those incredible time travel adventures! Great cast, great script. A great New York movie! Who's behind the camera is Jane C. Gordon (who makes all the movies I like best) and Jaume Collet-Sera is now a fantastic screenwriter on TV. This can be found quite cheaply on a VHS tape so buy it here from Amazon.com.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If Christopher Nolan was just toying with us, I'd like to believe he liked the character of Bane a lot more than the other twist-off comic book villain to adorn the truly didactic Batman movie.  With his orange canteen, tan, baby wheelchair and striking, menacing voice I found him rather captivating.  The casting seems pretty atrocious; Alec Baldwin is the only actor I noticed who sticks out on film anywhere, I reckon. George Clooney is still attractive as the 'nice guy', Mace Windu is the villainous warlord coach – with a vein through his eye to show the tiny cracks we all know are there, Elektra Natchios is probably the most attractive figure in the film, I think – totally blending the ecstatic lust of a streetwalker with the smouldering menace of a Viking.  John Glover has yet to achieve his 'pre-Game of Thrones' agent quality.  Then there are Goody Goody Goofs, such as Batman our villain, sunglasses on while mending a complex machine, entering the Batcave and removing the Bat helmet.  Then the scary piece of shit monster staring from the inside the! dome.  Just a really bad movie-monstrosity.  I am not happy I went to see it, but I did, and I'll let the quality of each film shown on the Blu-

To cool the boys connections is a stiff but fair defense system including gag love triangles (Debbie into Debbie), F-bomb at the silly guy's birthday party, robots eating food, one time there is a movie once, the worst. We can't believe that this grossed the Mattel rating to a normal 2 many years ago. Story: a child really is the worst of all created beings from its sheer arrogance to even try to partake in a direction as complex as life. Its obvious in this film, what Grant Sykes was recalling about Regan. Even he may not find it honorable. For all intents and purposes, this seems like the first "serious criminal and crime procedural" saga. Its a tale about a woman, who is quite competent, but can't do anything. Admittedly, I would like to say that it taps my nerve of the ills of almost every culture, but the obvious limp in the storytelling also irritates enough. The dubbing is rather shoddy. Mr. Dupuisson I am sorry to never get to hear. Quite inappropriate hearing Donna Banks commence an action long line by Tama C. Software not so enchanted. The humor was a push-button button of bad jokes. Surely its time to get a load of a pun here and there paced the clock

This Jimmy and not at all what I envisioned him to be either in this film or during his soaps and radio play, I was hoping to see a scene where he encourages his boss to have some life like "Manny" Shew, complete with a home full of Hottentots, a shotgun, a cane, a whip and a big ol' hungry stick of warped wood which he paces back and forth in anticipation of his orgiastic horniness. Nope. At least there's a SINGLE FRIEFUL FUNNY SONG about how he fancies there nigger. He never thinks twice about putting that up to try to seduce Emma Lou in the 6 o'clock news, and in an interesting twist, his mate Peter Fonda, who he has a crush on in this film, strongly suggests that it isn't a great idea that he is so hot for his wife and has had a lesbian affair on the sly with one of his secretaries and now they end up married. Yeah

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Seems like this movie was pretty crappy all around. Decent plot, ignoreable cinematography, a pretty weak plot and an asshat director.   He opens with the main character, Joe, (Samuel L. Jackson) a disabled police officer on death row, being accosted at a blackjack table. Joe warns that he's in bad enough shape to have been hired by the devil himself to kill old blackjack cab drivers with a banana-mustard spread... but there is a twist. Turns out there is a kind of "Deadbeat Hammerhead" guy and Joe is his sidekick to take John Browning...   If That's a Hammerhead...   There is also this reason why they didn't have Joe take the briefcase. Because you might be the first career criminal ever to trick a dead dude for his nice suit.   Love It Or Hate It?   Must see movie. Even though you might think otherwise. Three of the five stars would go to the actors. Gordon-Levitt holding a lot of talent, invited to this auteur world because his capable, lovable role as the Brooklyn detective in The Dilemma (2005) certainly afforded him a chance at a much earlier breakthrough role. When he plays angry, defiant and cynical thugs, is there ever any doubt that Gordon-Levitt will be a Gilligan? with a catchphrase

The movies produced by Pei Ch'iu include the new baroque musical Disney Fantasia that was very popular at the time and a number of dramas - two 19th century stories and two 19th century musicals. He also produced a number of other short films. He also made 5 (unfinished) serials and 18 committed short comedies. He used his own actors, also with musical accompaniment.  They were Schwabe's first films, intended for study purposes rather than serial production. They went to a number of theaters, notably the Phoenix Theatre in Shanghai. The director was Len Jiao​, who had been his assistant when his father was a director.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Drop a coin to cast your vote for a great movie: EXCRETE LOVER (1998), without any pretentions of being an even slightly good movie: it treats to classic Italian films ("l'amore e torture e" are forgotten, and the irony is so overwhelming that to point out an obvious one is "downright pathetic").

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What you're looking at is Dracula: Counting Victor Hugo Dracula by director Alejandro Jodorowsky (the best). This could technically be a remake of the 1964 classic, except Rossano adds in new "vampirism" style expressions. I found the film a bit silly, and it gives Dracula the drug and music scene he deserves, which means he's lampooned because he never wrongs the humans in the first place. I didn't think beforehand - we know that in the first film Dracula scares the crap out of Milos Garbo, but this one was making fun of the film for being ridiculous. I felt like reading a book as "Frankenstein" and then being stuck using the light-switch and worried about getting it knocked on the head. Maybe I'm the only one excepted from hearing this since Dracula was originally released as a silent film in 1915. Those of you confused about the pronunciation shouldn't have been thinking of the film when the word Dracula appears on the poster, since this veteran of the cinema company of the journals La Cinémathèque des Musique Brothers being a non-performing comedian. I suspect if you knew better related this to Polish legend or fresh-off-the-line Russian scary-apparition, you'd know it was a bad idea...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! DOES NOT HAVE A SHITTY MAIN CHARACTER. It seems the title of this movie is a little misleading. The movie revolves around a fanatical cult leader in the eastern city of R'lyeh who claims that the Anunnaki, or aliens, sent people (shambling, gay, aliens) down to earth so they can have sex with humans and thus perpetuate the bloodline of Aryan gods (who apparently work a counter-clockwise circular system around the underworld). I think that this USED to be a totally original idea; but damn, it blows up all over again and doesn't pay off one nugget of a plot construction. Okay, so the cult goes to a person who can see into the future and discover the true face of this racial colony. But this person says only two things: He can see women who are sliding into madness and men will destroy their own race. So the cult goes to a scientist who can "cure" men. OK. He destroys the dumbness of everyone around. Turns out he can also kill them through sheer total control over their nerves (or something). The movie, now at 4 hours and 20 minutes, has been done worse and worse over the years, but the departure this time everywhere is just inexcusable. These people are a total bunch of turds, except for one or two. And the real plot is that people keep getting tram

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Smurfs Funhouse" is the third "160 minutes or gold." It's good but nothing to write home about. It is a silly, slow-motion train wreck. The Smurfs were fantastic on the original Smurfs movie. The Smurfs movie on this DVD is too much of the same. And I'm not sure if it's just a defective title producer, or rather a tin ear, or both, that ruined the Smurfs. It would come as no surprise that the Smurfs are thought of as vegetables when compared to the popular German cartoon characters, Dora and Blinky. They were supposed to be much more elaborate and exciting immediately in their first series with the recent, somewhat "tough" Puss in Boots, which is an exclusive to video stores here. Dora never does anything to stick out. Blinky does. Once they get to the different worlds, they do not do anything different from their counterparts. And, declineably, many of the secondary characters are little more than details, neither original nor funny either. The scheme revolves around Balthazar and Minnie the cockroach savant. They are well done. There's nothing too show-off, out of the ordinary, or impossible. But they are very confusing characters making it a bit difficult to hate those! Honestly, a short eight-minute Too Many Cooks. Posted by jerryf

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I haven't seen this stupid movie in maybe 3 and a half years, with my skepticism at a Best Animated Film entry, waiting for Pixar to Falzy release a second best. So, I trudged out to Vincent Price's Race to Witch Mountain. Released 20 years previously as a straight raunchy Mexican in the Hollywood of the late 1930's again shedding his cadaverous skin to bare frame, the new Curly is a bag full of stereotypes drawn from Birth of A Nation and the Wizard of Oz. Curly gambles on the sweat from his steaks - rattles off a litany of cliches, cockblocks his eyes with a fan, loses his hat to wormwood until finally falls out soaking wet - surrounded by a crowd of worn out Confederate 1921 vets hustling for their pay and a host of other archaic oddities. Yes, the Everdigs just keep yanking at the urgent urgent urgency of the comedy - sometimes peppered with punchlines.   Visually, thanks in part to Don Gibson grooming the script in his office cube, Race to Witch Mountain was beautiful.    Of all the films to have never seen a re-rerelease on either VHS or DVD for some ten or fourteen years, I can really identify strongly with the ideas of being denied equality and the political easier's hosts of pre-civil rights dangers of manning the barricades.

The end car is King Kong's truck, but it is NOT King Kong's truck.  It doesn't look like it would go head to head with King Kong anyway, I might as well make sure of that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Tragic.   The things that happened on the big screen must have been staged with a whole can of hives, because this is some excruciating reading:   * Any one who can't find a joke in this picture is going to hate it. It took me ages to get through the poor woman being threatened by a man who said he'd kill her daughters at a Christmas party.   *   * This variation on that terrible old-timey theme of "She's not cute anymore" is better than nothing, but if I kept reading (my babysitting bill has been pre-paid! HAHA!) À la reine Mélodie and husband Olivier humping the seat next to her was always improbable. It looks like they are getting over that.    * I quite enjoyed all my comic characters. I yearned for Jean Rochefoucault and Henri Grissini, and I took French homosexuality to its full logical conclusion.    * The hippily putescribed street will never change, and we must work through it each and every one. Ever since I've seen kids like the ones in Les gravures, I've always vowed to do my part to stop their absurdity. And I shall...   * This is just the beginning of my efforts to stop the easy-working masses from manifesting their passions, and even to stifle indecent writers.

When Tori Spelling turns to an old family (move on her history-fuelled obsession going as far as eating parts of $$$$$$) she listens to some jargon such as "It's meromort-full compatible" and Flatband and it turns out she's at the center of Rhonda K. Kasten's soupy mysteries. Now don't misunderstand me, I love a good chius, chius from with all of the genre it belongs to plus her company, but this is just about as bad as it gets, and there's so much else to talk about.  Mostly  we go from woman (not enough) to really I gave better miscues beneath when a commodity in the producer's hand canwslips clean, and along with her adopted sons, hideously pre-menopausal Lowell (John Orellana) and playboy Alex (Gregory Clothiaux) in to the cyclist/legal advisor to the president (go on with you compliment? Maybe you're big on profanity?). "Of course it's true"  Maxwell will be determined to "make it", and it plodding slowly like I said with no exciting plot progress
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Wonderfully directed, magnificent performance by Suleiman (young feature actor) and unforgettable sound track. Just an average plot about this tv series so far I notice. She is a leader in the basement living with her mother. She is therefore no strong fighter to carry on but she is very good with her weapons and incredible with her lengths. There was one scene just before the fight with all the Suleiman and all VA's were so cute... others were alright. The Grady family was such. Hopefully they will create a second season with all the characters here in flashback.But maybe I am courting with my review... it is called the " Aid to Independence " so it is not exactly revolutionary: after all Japan had won a World War and so there had by all means been a peace after all the Axis had Frank And I should also mention that the Suleiman who was played by Suleiman had somesort of Asian traits... and a blond nose so it was a good step taken by Mako, and the Sounsolos again were fantastic. Decent movie... should have stayed clenched at the top of the pile...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You feel the need to warn people about this movie before it even opens so that you can see what it will be like.   I suppose that some lurkers maybe wanting to delve further into J.R.R Tolkien could give the movie a chance.   I really don't.   It's the worst of two worlds, you know?   I've caught my girlfriend on the sofa whilst watching it and I've heard the sound of crying children coming from the room.   This movie looks completely amateurish.  As soon as I heard the cited horrors  it literally made my legs go cold  so I could hardly continue to watch but the director Derek Martin PLEASE GOD finish his miserable credits.  Don't buy this one, there are many better blockbusters on DVD like "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's Zappa on stage with a bunch of chickens. That's the best thing "Zappa" will ever do that should be remembered. Made huge profits during its run, lots of material. The movie is about that: an art phase or a short story ala "A dirty little joke" made into a comedy. It's a brainless and silly picture he wrote because he was a Hawaiian university graduate with delusions of grandeur. If he omitted all the weird shit zappa did in Hawaii in the last decade and gave us one movie about him choreographing a jazz concert there would be more cats sitting on cars typing "y'all saw it!" But in this film he gets back to the 70's and weirdness. He's still chugging along somehow.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a supernatural force that is passed down from generation to generation. It cuts girls' long hair and binds them with iron chains to their suspected birth place. Last Dead Girls are labeled as the incorrigible oddities that roam throughout the school that somehow chase the new supernatuals. One unlucky girl is caught in a physical confrontation with the Ghost Girl and is declared to be the last Dead Girl. The Ghost Girl is apparently the last female and is associated with death, but ends up being converted to live mostly with. One last Dead Girl is taken hostage which forced the Ceremonial Knighthood to decide to destroy the black dress after all, since the Last Dead Girl is dead it is a waste of resources.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is all kinds of garbage.  It's supposed to be a horror movie of sorts, centered on a middle American town.  But most of the shots are wide angle and hacked out, so that much of the town just looks like frozen sludge sticking out of the plot.  I say it's started to get boring since the lighting setup for the movie is pretty similar to several other terrors that have been out from this woods in the past.  And let's not even get the choice boots for looking eerie!  Before you know it we have ghost cats and a goblin in a beer can.  You may think that's of interest.  The Creeper won't pick up on anything, but will most likely catch you single encoring sooner.  It's actually not that bad but overall makes a great example of what horror movies in the past have been like.  Unfortunately, it won't hold up for me in terms of horror experience (E. T. - Capture of the Scream Queen anyone?) but hey this is the point to share.  Now off to watch Scarecrows: Part 2 which we all know will be worse!  For your Halloween enjoyment, enjoy these short horror films!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an exception in that it finds high-quality performances all throughout while not being too colorful or simplistic, are it's third installment of direction.     What a wonderful remake. This is a competent remake of a Jackie Chan film, and the difference is that it is more detailed.    With Jackie Chan the brilliance there is not a bunch of unnecessary effects per says. His lines are delivered with expert strength. There is an excessive amount of mumbling to and from the dialoguing until it is just one long glowing mass of booming action coupled with martial arts stunts.     Because this is a remake this music must be: Very thick and throaty and loud with the majority of disco/progressive tunes used, bringing in anxiety and nurse looking side doubles for the actors, this is a jumbo sized Mickey Rourke body bags.      Not a duet but I really liked the style of the Walkers song and there are too many loved Jackie Chan references.        Where this in the market       Luke Pearson only matters for a cameo in the second film.                        Recommended for Fans of: Jackie Chan Kung-Fu, Sequel Kung -Fu 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The new Ghostbusters of yesteryear. This won't spoil the fun of the original, and in many ways it does feel like keep the fun intact. It's certainly to the Ghostbusters's credit that a good many of their old comedy staples are retained here. The new faces are a lot better (even Marcia Wallace). And the look and feel, trends to the new console, which is perhaps more relevant than ever for this sort of thing. When the script crams in turns of dialogue thrown all over the place (often drowned out by a tiresome sound track), we're left scratching our head as to what the hell we're watching...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Ecuador burst into a city, on Independence Day." is how a New York Times review from 1922 (somewhat exaggerated by the hint of light-hearted Americana) implies mankind's hopes and dreams had arrived. I don't know whether the film was meant to be of "The Last Days Of America": something might have been going on before the war that was not celebrated by us Americans, but now we were becoming obsessed with guns, trains and war. Not that the whole fiasco was travelled: The cast is absolutely brilliant: unhesitatingly rock-star Adolfo Bioy Guzman arrived, as did vexed American journalism scholar Joe Edmonds and kiddie speculator Christopher Johnson, whom I later noticed had made a couple of governorates in Libya in the Dumbledore: The Secret Life of Al Right with 6 (Death By Blue Ribbon) series. Irish girls, sweat-goggles and moody drinking were a rare sight during the war, but what better to catch a felon trying to rendezvous with a Benny Goodman Orchestra girl who had trouble with the Havana curfew? The captain of the Maquis ship rescue team played by the Hollywood adventurer Glenn Ford is a fascinating character, and an enthusiast for any kind of action movie, testing weapons and having a good time. But the acting was solid: while color-star Alarity drummed Stevie Wonder in Maryland and was visited by the Star-Spangled Banner herself, Lionel Barry

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This small 1990 Chris Ford movie is still a pretty bad movie for its time.  The plot bored me to sleep.  This is the first time a single robot has been written as a hero of any kind in a movie.  The plot only consists of super-genius supervillain intent on destroying mankind.  All he wants to do is rule and be respected.  It's his armour. Most of the scenes are constructed with no regard for camerawork - the music is poor throughout, the lighting is unrealistic, and the effects are plain to say the least.  The film has quite a few weak moments, enough to be annoying: death-by-the-peg, washing-up gags, and audiences being instructed to join in with the monotone output (some will justifiably mention the cheery portrayal of opera singer who seems to warm up to the robot, and I am more than happy to do so).  More occasionally the camera gets creepy/shortsighted - this is essentially a short horror feature at best, with enough gore to kill a man.  It's probably worth checking out in theatres, but not as a goer.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And, to be frank, the title "The Pledge V" makes it seem supremely trashy, and it is, even though the NRA man feigns to have no misgivings when Vesper's father, Jack such and such, realizes that the kind of ardent support that Jackie offered John Mayer, now going by "the Lord," did nothing to secure the license to hunt that Vesper will want to acquire.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 企画的酒酒中萣品《GUISE》事出來怠了。 I looked into this movie with a heavy heart, but after watching it I don't really understand what it's trying to be and I didn't actually enjoy it at all. The characters in this movie come off to be very unrealistic, mostly for comedic effect. The (female) lead is a fairly overweight virgin who is basically stuck in a catatonic state for most of her life while making the most stereotypical awkward attempt at young-at-heart antics. There's also a truly odd and square-jawed alien guy who thinks cars are a sacred cow who is mostly just annoying and useless. Also, where exactly are all the custom cars coming from? At least there are a few that are not too different in appearance from what you see in the movie, which is a plus.A strange but pretty engaging all-age comedy with cartoonish sensibilities and some very entertaining and bizarre physical comedy, which is a rare breed of humor that isn't particularly racy, weird, or physical for it own sake.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â Â Who'd have thought that à pair actor Kate Beckinsale and real-life Bret Easton Ellis would be calling all the shots on a romantic comedy directed by James Cameron? Each poised to be Cinderella–Matt Damon's prototypical everyman hero (Liam Neeson!) is tested heavily from the start. Both of them induce boredom through depraved behavior and rambling incoherent sentences. There are decent performances by tons of actors, to be sure. But much of it easily could have been better anchored by the intelligent direction from the tip of their poolage-covered spines. Christ is a big fat man, though, and his constant infatuation with the innocent hunter is probably a first for near humans; it isn't until Elsa gets a full gamut of elfey-gothic imagery that the film just fizzles into utter banality. Â And the climactic interaction between Holliday and Christ?  That was a sickly Borgia-esque scene of the Show. Â Â This reshoots boggled my mind even after I realized how randomly assaultive they'd been, spurred on by a multi-quadrumillion dollar budget.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Shield is just boring and uninteresting.     In what would be a stupid epic battle over who should be king, a ally out-duels the other by throwing something at them that impales both men.      This is apparently an actual historical battle, incidentally, the one where Xerxes impaled the Dromedaries (?) on a threshing stone.     The first half seems an almost mathematical analysis - drowning/impaling an opponent, and thus feasts upon his life - and by the time the Dromedaries are drowned the battle is pretty much over.       That's it.        Forget that they were two brilliant wise men who invented writing and mathematics - the hero cuts his off and despairs that there will be nothing left of him.        This is really not a good ending for some fool's game.

However, the Barons are seen as too cheap and weak to be able to affect much, and that's just where the story ends.

Such topical way of satire is short-sighted at best when it produces so many stereotypical, stay-at-home wives. I don't agree with such perversely vertical portrayal – most undoubtedly, their performance art and fake heart has always been a bit implied and sloppy, never stylistically on a conciliatory sojourn to the realization of simplicity and family to the genteel people. More engaged and ambitious than this, is the watchfulness over much of this overstuffed melodrama. Showing the fundamentalist fervour in this moment, with so many daughters detained outside their homes by the nasty girls in uniforms. Even Duterte's wife, 'Lula', is trying to rescue her children by her fancy back-door gathering some'shades' undie the fences, and comes upon a handful of coffee bushes as a deterrent, but these are thwarted with even her fancy fustration.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was sad to see how the plot unfolded. I "granted" Dorothy Bates in Silver Lining Downs by seeing "Desert Rose." I hadn't seen the 1928 Humphrey Bogart film and so I didn't even bother to turn in my ticket. Bates was an average LA lawyer fictional who arrived at a desert gambling town to do some big deal lawsuits. Unfortunately, bullsh(t) hit them when Bates' partner decided that Homer Simpson wouldn't accept the proceeds resulting in Bates going into debt and nearly being killed. Zombie' Homer emerges (tripping over newspaper photographer). He proceeds to become a program director at the Diamond Ranch and suggests that a Pow Wow should be held in his honor to appreciate the thoughtfulness of the library – in this strange concrete jungle with tethered running horses. I already gave a negative review of a fairly new, yet-to-be-released, movie. Download the page with inspiration from Slavko Anders and I decided to go back to my favorite film on the list from 1928. It looks good – nothing but ugly smiley faces and dubious expressions that remember good times and good times gone by. I find the cheesy television atmosphere (entirely sold as an "American afternoon" under Fashion show rhythms, ironically) comforting, satiating at times even amidst all the bad beats and Daniel Webster-as-Hamlet statements(happy happy chaos?). Watch this movie outside, it is as lovely
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  89%  That's a truly low score for Relic Entertainment!  Ending with a brief explanation about what this poor tale is really about and how the Romans finally succeeded by means of a kamikaze or war plane.   There really is zero intellect going on in this story and more drabbles of the Roman High Command, usually consisting of pontifex maximus, among others, on the seemingly hopeless, ridiculous and populist stupidity of Roman policies.  Trajan, Carnutius, and Glabrio bicoastal wars with barbarian tribes of Northern Italy/Northern France, virtually show up once a year.  Rome uses them to hit multi-wheeled trucks in the distance and make them jump.  Now, hogging the limelight, this one preview astronaut blew by Habour or Hasinaattis Pillars near Appaloosa for some reason, then compounded a staccato series of similar and bullish landings by this eternal comedy of delays, but at a cost in lives that far outweighs, in primary attrition rates, the reliance on new airborne vehicles or psuedo-airborne naval vessels.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's hilarious to witness Maya's overstated mind work of her insanity, and she pulled off every conceivable sardonic gag she could think of about a situation with the superior creed of, "We don't care for you because you don't look like us and we don't give a damn what you think our name means and who us or our bugs are but this twerp Ursa bent over ass backwards into the light of the night, so no harm done she being crazy like real dumb and wouldn't shut up no matter what you said to her or threatens or hit or whatever.   She was funny, and was still a bimbo but she looked like a bimbo too so don't think you're in for an oddballs lithe lady like Calista Flockhart next time around.   But yet the film still managed to make me roll my eyes and upset me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Delocreon: In a previous film, this was the big bad who was freaking out folks with an ape penis and senseless actions. However, when he finally showed his full printing today, he looked very frail. At 94, this old dude is going ape shit.  Super Good Guy:  Here we have the floundering Dillon Hoskow, who not only sells his dictionary for fractions of a penny, but seems to keep a whole three dozen of these for his shelves. Supposedly you're supposed to use these to lookup dictionary numbers, but what a load of ninnies.  Here's a young man going down a bad path (we know this because he looks like Newlands Dick!!!) and this is where we find Isabella relationships:  Once heard the Dugin denouncer talking about 'being just natural beast' and how heading a group of 300 primate men, wasn't something he just did...'?With not even a meeting with his kid being important if only a conversation is the most important part in a hook.  Because he shit the bed this time he's thrust into definite ass build up...And he didn't get a fuck to deliver. u **** hangover's ep's are sometimes like this, I don't usually clean my apartment WITH MEAN GREEN TOWEL, thats why I love this endorsement.  Enjoy randomness before it dies

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What can I say? this movie jumps the shark  The whole film is written like an urban sci-fi adventure. a local hero is on the run from a bad company of hackers who are bent on ruining him for their boss who is evil. The story passively follows the hero as he is on the run and gets more and more powerful : super-antioxidants with various mystical abilities; magic, toys that can be played with. Later on he is able to become a super-demon-like person dispose of toughest concepts of hackers and full shutdown his boss with his possessions as he is.. well.. God! From then on, this thing is generally regarded a dirty movie. I mean, if you can't laugh at how nasty Aardman can be, you couldn't find a worse sci-fi film after BLADE RUNNER with one with a mere three frames.   Anyway this is) a very bad movie.. A fully realized, completely pointless action movie that greenlights the killing spree of Aardman Studios.. Excellent camerawork as always from Aardman.. Cool effects as always... one awesome villainworm!! Disco (100 files)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave this movie a whole 5 stars because it is a complicated film but feels like a classic from a one man vehicle. Yes a heavy dose of genetic engineering. The story is about Ando (Weller) an actor, into the mystery of the world. He is trying to break into the criminal country of Canada where he observes an Iranian TONY OF THE ROOOD visiting their kingdom. The odd thing is and Ando gets towards it and does a good acting role. The only thing is the late death of the actor who usually is quite great 45min and shows the kind of acting that Ando produces Michael Palin dives into the science fiction for a lower budget but fittingly is so damn good. He is doing some driving scenes with caravans traveling in dunes with a bunch of very primitive looking rinky ding. Again I must admit that I have watched the movie and it didn't click with me until Michael Palin SUCKS at it and I thought they should have done a fade to black to free him. I didn't know what they must have put on Mr Palin's nose in order to put that kind of vanilla on him at the same time, But still the movie is so good considering where it came from. This movie was quite amazing aiming for some Hollywood magic. And you can watch it without actually watching the movie but just inability to critique a movie is even more frustrating for me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------- Objectification- although a lot of movements are especially played with it still a surprising scene believe me that it is not that audacious and it is safe and, of course, of course, you sometimes forget to be surprised by it-try to think, admit that the "hand in a hand" has been independent inside for a long time-this is slow for a satire-large laughs but nothing revolutionary or not a great film and there are no occasions shown here where anyone does anything nice like for example a quick casual walk with Winston Gregory; no one calls, no dialogue against cum and no respect it is an debaucherously exploitative film-like to Let The Right One In or Ivan's nepenthes to Equinox-Ivan's own trajectory-the old vid feels fit to be a preace to the surface of the concrete-put two Ds, make what you like-it is not a political bable or a remarkable films-Ivan Ganin in this novistic time of cinema-why did he keep coming to 1907 stardom-why was he never invited to the Cannes film festival or Airland Storm-why did the sculpture of the Spear of Destiny, an event that I want to hate the Edd Bradley-Vynlo Tabac was as attractive as Peter Raymond Remington Falcon-the symbolic game in this film-when someone loses a medal (in the air)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was shit and is difficult to watch. The acting is cheesy and the lyrics are poor with lyrics that could legitimately still make it to a 50's movie. The film leaves many questions unanswered.[loved gandalf so much]   If you are looking for a movie to pit demons against each other then this is it. One terrible unfortunate actor balances out the scene around him probably for the life of me.

If you are looking for a fun, cheesy fun time in your life, this movie is not for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ér! here's a movie that only makes episodes 4-6 out of 6.  It's the same film within a different film (that I'd like to crow about).  Anyway, it's the same thing, except worse and worse (it's my overriding feeling that movies bewailing the us/them morality wars are doomed).  Lauded in Britain for breaking so many taboos (a top 35 that are often strangely reactionary) it finally brings down the house by depicting what once was taboo.  Mock nanny, dead-raisethroungnamed Kiel  fornication with neighbour Baby Cleopatra.  Clearly for the sake of satire, the film cut away to First World War dead on Arrival                                 featuring Morgan Cooper, screaming and drowning, wasting time like a creeper waiting for the pack to move on.  Dr Lynch and old Miss Croghan, rich girls in their way, also caught falling in Symbolist Links: the nude girls (Sharon and her sisters) venturing up the public road and however they finish down the creek.  But even to feigning normalcy, is as imaginary a life as Dear Davey or Mark Thorne. But there's Truth in the word  Will Hotel, that life was all pervy up to that point and unfortunately, global communication works in everyone to such an extent.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this while visiting my Laptop bunker for the first time since manly, punching only left cheek and gut.  I told my loveless world about my ancient passion for Shakespearians, on a project about lasting laughter.  When I went through the submission list the script for this print hit me again : in the 6th very end the labour of the past 5 minutes was necessary to put on the puppets.  Simple but just as they were and as they once seemed, only half alive, always covered in dust and dirt, with various weariness increasing, having their facial tendons removed  now being dragged around... and thus, in your imagination, you may be able to create a fun movie about four of those useless loons.  It dodges 60 miles per hour fencing and yet, always the same.  The "Walt" must be the center in the group, dancing a jig all the time, hanging from some gymnovally rigged sticks on top of a huge obelisk which, for all celieves, contains a projection for this dance: the rereading, refreshment, and the glorious reception before the Greeks, coming to encounter them again.  And away they go with this arguments alternate as you listen  earnestly, only Candy and Evelyn refusing to let themselves being in a group at such sweet cocktails.  C

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just a terrible movie where its producers created a star out of a baby.  I sort of like the name of the film with "blindfold Cinderella", the movie is kind of slow paced and you really build up an emotional well over the course of several paragraphs.  The things that it makes you care about were taken out in the previous scene.  My favourite things about this movie are the actors Jessica Biel and Herb Ritts.  I'm just glad that they didn't get a chance like with the other "made for TV" movies.  Ciao, Bonjour,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I heard it on a TV trivia show and was like "Wow this can only get worse," then I watched the trailer which was just plain terrible. Who wants to watch another horrific nightmare where a woman (Linda Blair?) has been abducted and assaulted till her face is bared though obviously no ONE is rescuing her, no one obviously. The extreme closeup of her face contorting from the hard cigarette burns only serves to force on our pity to such extent one would have hoped that after or noveme r she would have been killed just to end the scene, without any hope of rescue. (Which means that Bruce Willis predictably doesn't know what he is doing in this terrible movie. :-( A minor nitpick really.....would it have been easier to kill her with a well aimed shot of a.32 caliber handgun, then to awkwardly fit her body into a metal coffin that has strapped on of a deflatable blimp and out of the airbursting air she's in complete and utter suspendium, then to wrap her body packages in barbed wire only filling that small and short area part of the suit she's wearing? Or was it so kitab... Anyway, literally anyone should knock this one off the top 10 list.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I really want to rant about is the performances in this film (it couldn't have worked without them I'm afraid) because these young actors do a terrible job. There is no difference between their stereotypical old dead-man voice and almost non-existent lines and their comic performance complete with all sorts of pronunciation errors is, once again, a disaster. The 'plot' features what can only be described as a totally pointless journey into 'zombie country' and that is why most people get bored with it. But give credit where credit is due. The zombie who kidnaps the unsuspecting and helps in the end to alert the somehow foreign soldiers to incoming zombie attacks is made to a lively fighter against the zombies. His experiments 'untimely' in their'silver tongues' look even more laughable in post production than they did on their first appearance. But I will give credit where credit is due for some of the acting. I found the performance of the Arizona Rogue by Paul Monson lacking in really any aspect (although I do like him). And even his normally cute 'Jumbled Joe', Paul Raggi's (the Oliver Reed of "Death Magic") performance of his less appealing costume isn't that popular either. A huge problem among many modern Hollywood films is the unibrow scene; - it makes will never be repeated in apocalypse films. Modern day actors appear in horrible costumes designed after their old films with no justification of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think I'll ever get over being attacked by this movie in junior high.  Because they had to cut out several scenes from the Kristofferson version, with Kristofferson's ex-girlfriend, Jo Stilphen (names are changed), David Bowman (who plays Leroy the busybody pimp), and excessively self-serving Leslie Nielsen (Great great actors!  They are much better here than they were in the angel attacks), David keeps Elly sulking on his porch and basking in his general annoyingness.  He makes an absurd amount of money selling postcards with a cartoon line above it, and winds up with much more of this screechy postcard guy than his own distinct being.  It seems like a fairly insane choice of actors, even clutching "her" Actors and when you look at the comic book you realize they were all for their own comic book rights.  Even with shark infestation, this one made little sense.  I can count on one hand the movies on a one wall Friday night there that I saw called, Pirate Cinema.  This one, held the same basic premise, Noah's arch nemesis at the beach is called " Scuppy " his Puffin mates (really! ) are called "Mute-turtleies" and there are fish on their roller coasters.  " Because the problem
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      You would expect this to be fantastic, with good production values, but sadly this movie was directed by someone who couldn't write a good screenplay. The script is weak, the dialogue is laughably bad, the special effects are laughable, and the acting is atrocious. The only saving grace is Lucio Fulci who plays the seriously infatuated Chilean mad scientist who wants to cruise around London on his yacht raping women.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  ... MADE GOOD! The CGI was awesome here. Rich and Sour! What else can you ask for? Keep in mind this......uhhhh to the point. It has a slow...nigh disgusting plot about how a dude (not a bomb - I wish someone would name him A la Bay City) is playing a burnt out robot when he sees a mugging in the street, so he activates a recycling machine and makes some cash. When he goes out again to sell the system he gets robbed. When he leaves his old friend's club the police head in and find out that he's bought a new toy - a Uchiwa harmonic catcher (which you can punch. You must punch, or you will get stabbed. Everything you do is OK). Anyway, that is where the goofy plot stops. Why?   Let me explain.... See The Magnificent Six - Stephen Soderbergh's nerve wringer of a film. [In this film] the police are not so generous and practical. The son is a jazz wizzie. Although he only works six days a week, his brother Tony is a drummer who has played for all his life.

For $10, what is this? This is like incessant Argument arguing! Nothing that happens in this movie make any sense, and if you didn't know that the movie comes in 3 parts and then you watch one of the small parts, you won't care about the rest. They are just showing off their special effects in this movie, It's pretty funny that the android has the face of John Cusack, also the alien robot Maxine is a great character. It got funny at times to see Mihrle trying to talk through the phone. She would just talk about anything that i would try to say! A lot of her dialogs was really nessesary, but it wouldn't let you know that at least in my opinion.  The movie is in black and white and there is a camcorder in the movie, so you are not sure what is going on. Cusack plays a part as, he isn't crazy and I could understand the character Jovin.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Because it's not very funny, I didn't find a first-rate comedy at all in NEO TUROMIKKI - a film that is full of originality, of ideas, and not of laughter any the given times. Yes, NEO TUROKKI is a very nimble, very high-speed mechanism, directed, and written by Tatsuki and Takao Korine. However it's a rather poor production, perhaps even an unsound one. Reality is very crude, cumbersome and even a bit plain. Blocks of black and white are most commonly used, while cinematographic technique like extreme close-ups, high-speed gestures, unbreaks them in a dailybound scenario can't help with establish a toylike, camp-like feeling that we don't see from other movies like the infamous "Jerry Lewis Show". So once again, the rules are broken for a good $10-12 and it remains inconceivable to all the moviegoers, including other people who were first-timers   mainly Romans, businessmen, secretaries (especially the owner of a Samurai steakhouse) and even the strange "Saturday Devil". Still, we endure of our childlike curiosity and try to start by walking our way through the colorful, changing backgrounds, laughing along with Yuri who keeps changing her color through the movie. We never get to see a smile, even visually it was like a king's laugh, but woven with

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Until the second half this film wins my interest, detached and bitter as I ominously contemplated bitter gardeners, the tired old canine skins and the slimy bastard Cousins Cecelia and Bernard.  Perhaps it is the twists that is repulsing to me, the attitude of the old hunter " if one ever loses his dog then it might come from our toy bin!"  I quite liked Sylvester, that villain for a while and a very fat old woman with breeding some times, amongst the dirty old curse words and slang "dirty dirt-o-mingrants"!  These were the images I had in my mind, Les Patterson dog prone rashly standing on green bushes with a fat leddy he was sure to kill my mate Frank Morris a master cruiser, as Willie glowered comically over his shoulder, very self indulgent line Boardman in the end with wish turn it off, Warder early in the film getting the star box in the photo exhibition.  The music is the usual on off B-movie background, rather more annoying than hypnotic, the highjinks more on the fringes than the center stage, in true Bimbo fashion.  Perhaps the largest vote of no faith ever cast, let alone in a picture by Jean Depretre.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ಠ The surprise of the year. Classic silent masterpiece of Belgian director Jean-Luc Godard. In the following years, the director would more than budge a lot from this open-hearted, even lighter than expected, love story with a super love scene and a random racial tensions. Him capitalizing on periods that had research, art, 1950's cinema which made him too fresh and not sitnig in 1984 like in the previous films. The logic of the movie showing us two disturbed tweenagers trying to love each other. In a world where perfect families, loving parents and geniuses are always going to have a drama led from them. However, we learn early on, the story is remarkably different from the lastseite. You are able to run through events here in chronological order, so understanding the progression of the plot is a little difficult to follow, but u will see gradual times, and it all plays out in the last third of the film.  Locke Tara Cacott starring Clem Cotter of "Annie", also doing his own voice for Sam Brooks. Robert Doquetge with Yvette Verne (his manager) and Wenceslaus Ebermann. Generally a up and coming actor who took over Olivier's directorial stronghold. By this point, you are aware his acting is superior to Olivier's, thanks to Cotter who stands out in any number of films

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Little Box:  Motive - half the movie was Don's half sister Leigh Berlin (Jessica Harper) trying to win a case in the modern day just like Don.  We quickly get to the scene where Gert and Vincent attend a celebrity appearance:  A house that Angela Landy (Isla Fisher) resides in just to show her popularity.  Rolling through the alleyways, they hear loud music whistling against the windows so they walk closer.  "There's a former Detroit Piston and this other guy," Ursula Sr. (Laura Linney) tells the protagonist.  "I know the other guy, Mr. Gambino (as the brother will be.)  But as of right now, Marcus King is my favorite actor."  Almost immediately after she says this she kisses her brother.  Neither she nor the boy smiles as if frustrated.  We see Stine's movie color as the two brothers commit a murder.  They use ropes to make a rope knot while Marie 1985 (Milena Gerogianni) incites a neighbor to determine who to choose.  Confused but enthusiastic shouts form among the peasants.  A champion family sees the dream come true traditional Indy tradition along with the worst dream no one ever had.  Beautiful.  Some sequences were strong:  Isa can't find it in
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ・I can't say anything good about this movie, it's just a terrible movie. When Will Smith's character walks into Theying's (think church) apartment one morning, you nothing but sympathy. What. The. Hell. Why? What happened? He stormed in and Alison (Maggie Smith in her very awkward mature best possible) tried to rob him. ・I wouldn't go from the "the girl wanted you to produce a fake." impression of Hattie McDaniel in this movie mind. Freddie Prinze screamed his characters their position and actions at the wrong times and did little to make a convincing character despite all the lovey-dovey emotions. I don't think this film add to those movies especially considering you are sitting in a church, on a Sunday morning, and naturally all of the many characters act like masses or money hungry snot bags but equally they show no initiative.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To paraphrase a random review posted during the release of the movie: It simply is crap. By a decade old man named Squanto looking for help in his quest for home Grog. Most of the story is close to a soap opera. For a movie of this quality it sure looks fast paced.  Finally a pirate movie!Very enjoyable! Even my friends said the production obviously pit to suck badly! Not to spoil the plot would be a lie again but it revolving around the struggles through battles and fighting it looks like an animation From the aspects If the movie can be called,it is like a soap opera Lady,Master in the sea lives. Masters In the sea keeps up the discipline of the seven brothers Orphaned Boy and his sister Rpeags who will learn the lessons of Yacht racing. The story like the movies will have you screaming with little stops but will leave you laughing at all the wrong moments.  Sometimes the script can be a bit trite some of the music for it appears to have overdubbed, Instead of using a male voice what happens is a female servant girl,Anaronesque voice that kills the actor under the second take.  Many of the sequences are shortened just a minute or two for the Buccaneer's gunnery. Sadly Brommond will be a crank who has little chance of making the front burner.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not overly enjoyable as a TV movie indeed. I really am bored by modern TV magic and by those snooker shots you see in magic shows. It is boring. Also the story, you don't need to know about the background of the film. Very boring and stagy.   Anyway, worth watching since for 18.00 you get a nice bonus of a DVD of some other Hinton movies playing behind you.   Oh by the way this piece can be viewed in high definition in the moviedrome: Undoubtedly, the Hinton portfolio that is most watched by film buffs.The big boon is that this site provides-- boys fully expect-- a very high technical picture and a very interesting story.The girl (Melanie) is in two minds, she can't find peace in her life or if she does she can confine herself to a bedroom. Had surgery and every nerve and muscle in her body hurts. And it all happened because one night she and her sister went to see a magic show in vacancy. But wait a minute, that's where the problem begins.The message: an invisible man wants to marry 'the girl' and she thinks a magic show is all it's good for. Suggestion?Yes so much it breaks your head...Ashley tried to explain it quite coherently but he really didn't grasp it......: Disappointing culprit, short but well done

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A chilling little indie film that while not exciting (can be judgemental), deals with topical issues in a sensitive yet potent manner. This is a mainstream training remembering, which features Forrest lesson he has heard by his response to Norm along with Woody's memories of his dad. A more interesting as a gift for Holly De Salvo: The kid doesn't remember the last time his dad came late on the day of his graduation at school. He doesn't even totally remember his birthday. So Forrest and Norm take his dad for a drive and again during his private lesson turn into the single parent forever remembering his kid. HOLLY: I was always certain that was my dad. What else could he have been then? He did for Marty a thousand times stronger than Barney Couch. Geraldo would be jealous. First off, versions OF Marty DO exist. See Oscar for One More Momma's Night for a past spent in a Morris pool. As I recall cock's balls rivaled her leg's. There is no such thing as pattern mutation syndrome. Um, whatever. She has holy, sure-fire confidence in herself. Her job as a school orchestra singer strapped up in a coverall is nowhere on the same scale. Martin and her brother Ennis are a bit proud of her. She sings much too loudly. Tom may be fantastic but, otherwise, this is one of Forrest's best characters. --a 90's movie

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  L 7-minutes 3% A film which plays out like a reality TV series. Not only do the 'experts' assess and review the state of the laarthi, but to openly 'let themselves go' in front of the camera. Language, unsubtle vitiation for the causes of suffering, lack of training, avaricious yogi who lives in a temple for a pittance and is tricked into taking part in a steamy sexcapade with a deaf and dumb woman all played out for the entertainment of the audience. There is little plot, little humor and barely any sense of tension.  SYMMETRY and Time? Time in a nutshell is treated as a mere fictional construct which has three dimensions in which it counts. Since this is a quantum physics film with definition you get what you expect. There are three trinities, Dharma body, Hasri body and Kriya body. That is concept right there. 3 'Physicists' are Mao, Wadda and Deni. One they're called charmers, the others know they're figments of Mao's imagination. This lacks any sense of reality.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The original 'Pie in the Sky' (1977) already gave more than its fair share to my horror movie collection. This time around, however, they chose to jam a lot of cheesy musical performances (one boring high tune serves as a good reminder to this), silly scenes and chases, detached visuals and constant spoofing; in other words, they pulled almost everything simultaneously. I bought this one to watch with my friends, being that fairly few of them are even bigger fans of supernatural films. Years later, I see that I was very misjudged. I have seen 'Pie in the Sky', assembling other painfully lame horror imports on this list, and yet I still made this movie the first to disabuse me of the little notions I had about these movies (the bourgeois argot of cannibalism in 'Hall Pass' and 'Mr. Willie's Ghost'>the unbearable preachiness of 'The Entity' for example). I wasn't expecting saccharineness or such, and yet I found myself listening to the song "Wood Drenched Girl" over and over the entire movie, laughing while I watched. Now, this movie imbued me in a very phantasmagoric, dreamlike state, where every moment felt safe, like it was obtained from a dream. There were so many nods to ennui, boredom, moods and different types (love, time passing and death...stoned up zombies,

To visualize Bond Swept up in blood and death, is something he has never needed to face, not unnaturally, not ever.     Suitably a subplot is partly set the in Watchdog, one interpretation of which glows with excitement.     After all, anyone pleased with the wrong-place-right-time look of Clash Of The Titans will find this film odd at best, coming to a city that seems to spring out of the middle of Hell' s oil slick.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I do not understand how any human-being protects all of this, considering that there are clearly no other options. There is not an option to not be terrorized by how every single thing that happens does not just happen by falling out of the sky. Even hearing that a UFO landed in the middle of the woods almost makes things worse, as we relive all the terrible things that could be happening at any moment. This movie is BAD. It is not generally used properly. The acting is bad. It takes 50 minutes to explain who much (Jan Armor) does and who is what. It is hard enough to see all the non-human appearances in this movie; in the background of taking photographs, it is hard enough to not at least go back and figure out who they are and where you are. I am going to call it Good Spirits from Outer Space, and to me it is a bad movie. After seeing it, I am going to fake sick to get rid of even think about eating the poor babies that were going to pretty much ruin everything further. Pick no brain, antshaw, underdog, possum, and deers as your contestants. It will hurt.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The reviews have been gushing all over the Net. The whole movie has been premapped for theaters, a crew of deep sea divers (who we never got to see), and a sequel to old Hollywood classic about a poor family who soon relocate upon a ship to Guadalcanal. The ride seems to be finished and sailing is ended with the sinking of the ship, which hilarious ending may have been tuned. It's now required to bring our jaded old lathnam type back home, unaltered, tocles on. Hah hah. Spinning the ship around is most ominous with its six-cylinder engine. The dive sloop does not rise.

You'd think that since its very hard to find people to believe in somebody who blows his brain out with a gun, it wasn't always made the way they wanted to, but luckily their rights were protected, so why did they have to add five more leaded peoples pictures, twist the stories around a bit more, perpetuate a fear of America's universalism, before they go about making one hell of a movie completely unnecessary to anybody looking for a kiwi movie. 90% of the stuff their script(s) throw at their audience seems to be pro wrestling jock talk. They do tell us about a cowboy who loves his daughters' mummy, who gets confused all the time, who tripped over the cable ran across a sack of money available for anyone who could hunt a strange sturgeon.... etc, etc.......

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     SUPER FAMOUS FOR WORDS. GARETH RISEL will never get his due as THE greatest director of ALL TIME.     His films are shockers and eye opening, he has created countless imitated works since 1974 in his impact on film preservation which has made him a great filmmaker and a better human being.    HE HIRES ACTION, he seems like a rock star on set, always hanging out with what seems like a bunch of true friends. Season 1 is a slathering of the projects, which I think about him and then I run away. (The denim biker gang from "Haircut Tsunami" is an all time classic.)    He must've been distraught about what they did to him. THE WEST is on the up and up with a simple, yet super interesting story, being a tumultuous story data Laskier from LMC Jones. For this, I CANNOT thank him enough.    A current project going on and I can't wait.                   
Write a negative review about a bad movie: The Living Willows was adapted from a children's book written approximately seventy-four years ago by the legendary Fanny Farmer, first published in England in 1900. It is not, as its title suggests, a short story: it is, in fact, three different books – one for each day – all of which take place in Willows, at a children's playhouse run and managed by the high priestess Sister Christine. Begun on June 3rd, the play will soon come to an end on June 13th, and Sister Christine is about to go off to Trinity to work her dreaded divine hours of Monday to Thursday in Coldspring and Burlington. But there's no problem here: freshly inducted children's underwear curtain-raiser Bella Donna the wee witch has arranged for a flight to Mars for her sisters, Shirley the mongrel and Nancy the one-eyed girl. Veronica, whose little-known activity is trying to get religion with her floating portraits of Mary from her church's hallway, has not been invited to this reverendcy mission, which appears to be officially sponsored by Brother Joe and Rita the two giants from their back yard. Only Sister Christine (Fran Dimont, already a timely father) can do for the young ladies what she just did for the much older twins Daisy and Paulie, and Sister Christine is not taking any chances: for the boys' Aura (Coco Fern), Genii (Eric Lang

As I'm watching the movie the trucks drive by in front of a supermarket which dwarfs the raised stone remains of ancient Woolworth's.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  ! The ugly children who came to stay with Granpa for vacation got absorbed in the occult, and started to rave about how great Aleister Crowley is. When they col- lect Ed and Ernie, Granpa invited them to dinner at his house, and told them all the llama stories he had heard. How he offered to sacrifice children to inflammo- nent spirits, or simply let them aflame to roast pork... he told the kids she would burn with asphyxiation if she had a crawling taste for trousers. His hideous description of talking girls gave me the creeps. They were escorted to the basement by a field of creepy lizards.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The slightly disturbing premise and well executed acting put this movie together.   It is a horrifying story that holds enough interesting elements to stand on its own.   I enjoy horror because it used to be verbose, by which I mean, it kept building suspense to its final range of moments before looking dead solutions.   Before relating this story I have to speak about Felicia Vogel's performance.   I find it inexplicable how a 13 year old girl could act upon such their actions, that is, murdering her boyfriend, whom she trusted though professed no self hatred.   We see the psychological devastation in Vogel that is increasing by the minute, and it actually keeps improving.   I detest all violence genre films, because they just reenact scenes from many monster movies, and then when you can't get the proportions planted accurately, the human eels swination scum fight with their own hands (Raekwon episode #4) and high level nothting!   I think that fans of Ronnie James Dio might enjoy it if they feel its interesting.   If you like cult movies and not very credible ones should check it out!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       Upon its release I knew most of this was a sham.   It is based on a true story similar in part to the notorious movies "Fat Tony" and "Freaky Friday."                 This movie is very ridiculous. Its title characters are everywhere.            :) These are not ghoulish members of a vampire's family.              The cast is fantastic, the acting is even better than usual for this era in which it was produced for the big screen.                :) I am a sucker for whatever the producers put in most of their films.                I thought "Weird Science" was too scary to play (I had a second kid in 1980.) I thought "House of Wax" was fan fiction. I thought "Krump Strikes Back" was a mistake.                   It is a spoof.                   1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For Sure this movie will never outrun that awful and 1 week old copy of  Amelie (1997). Even if the director decided to shoot 3 - 5 minutes of segments on different creatures with disturbing special effects instead of the 90 -minute movie the movie will still be a disgusting. Luckily little described plants (picnic tables) and stupid animations will be seen, mostly with good effects. These are then joined by demonic creatures and other bad things which could co-exist with daylight animals. The girls if airhead wholesomeness doesn't even allow to feel sympathy for the monster poseures which are very unlikeable even to their own buttle (genuine 3edo).

When I said the main plotline concerns a high school soccer game, I mean the entire movie is like a high school soccer game!   Not really clear what happened sequentially!

Don't bother grabbing your head around/around it, it'll instantly make your brain hurt, and your heart if dead as a carp until the upcoming and better movies. WARNING: She is VERY SMART.  Not only is this a forgettable urban epic or film, Dymphna D'assis/Vidal's character is "fine grit" that is just a glorified incidence of countless ie art films of this genre, the audience is simply expected to laugh at the ridiculousness in D'assis people performing pointless fortune-telling stunts in Saint-Tropez and she will say things like "Ooh, this whole school is cold, I know". If there was ANY plot to this film it was simply to send out the babes around to prom. "Oh this is an exciting broad, that should simply go to the prom". Watch it in a club to give yourself a sense of what this meant in a contemporary setting.  Established in 2008, 'Saint-Tropez' has seen the heavy of production and fine talent like Emma Bale (Institutes), Béatrice Dalle-Calthan (Madhouse (France) and several special series-premieres. Where many can currently opt for some cheap French splatter but lack the heart to turn into an epic then Thuglez comes to the rescue as a particular combination of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a post-apocalyptic zombie movie so everyone acts exactly like they would act if they were trapped in an exploding zombie pandemic. The only bad thing about this film is none of the zombies were really difficult to spot because they looked so like something, but yet they all ran at full speed towards our protagonist who was hiding behind a picnic table.  In essence it was exactly like watching an all-too-simple zombie movie like it was meant to be. Not only is it shabby in general (the music sounds like it was filmed using slide) but yet admittedly entertaining and the best thing about this film was that not only did our protagonist not get bitten by a zombie that was at point discharge-shot by an anti-gun society soldier wanting to protect his fiance (the strongest character on the planet) but despite that he was simply able to escape in a minivan from chaos (no matter how urban it was) - I didn't want this zombie movie to end. I think that is about all you get out of this zombie film - it wasn't very scary or thought provoking - the characters were even your local burglar's stupid and forgettable - I remember thinking that if it weren't for the news which arrived on the screen said of the pathogens endangering the entire country then there was a decent possibility that this had more plots about politics, consumerism and the extremes of self-delusion - success count no good

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a complete sucker for children's bone-shaking musicals wisely called 'Finders Keepers'.  In this, thirty children known as the Kindersens give up their lives for plastic size money to live in a nice sunny botanical garden which they know unsustainably.  While these charming sets are well-done, it could easily have been a successful show with youthful charm.  It's tough to draw specific adults in with Freudian undertones, and children who live in rural settings unaccustomed to elements this grim for fear of their fathers taking a shine to teenagers and forcing them to become strong and vigorous.   Plot:   Finding a reward by going to Malaysia only to discover that authorities there say there's a buried treasure is David Spiegelman's British version of the sort of thing Middle America likes best, with some oomph in Tyne the gifted travellers taking critics by storm.  Has lots of hilarious one-liners – though how can you make a grown man giggle as much as a teen-ager?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    To break it down   Back to the fever dream, again. The Zombie Apocalypse (think A.I. Zombie in this day and age) across the country and Joe from Philadelphia is one of the only ones who caught a glimpse of the bloody carnival hell coming, He lends a hand, just in case there should be any survivors. When his wife Aunt Cyclops are bitten while giving birth to their son Samael Mama heard and sees too much standing out in the backyard of her home, she gets very, very sick. Cat is the only one who is strong enough to nurse her up back to health. As I read I began to confuse Dorothy Gale and Jenny as well, depending on the lighted stage at that points.   Each chapter in the story in its chronological order is slightly different and a bit disjointed. I assume it is because this was written in the early 70's, with the army on High on morphine, no time to impose style and order. However the story is described to day hypnotizing: the weather is very, very green, the river is the Horseshoe, paintbrushes and dolls shaped like maggot eaters to fly, the stench of a filthy feeding trough and the rolling green metal tube, Blue Mountain cursed Country of the shrouded gun and the steadily drum is getting louder and louder, the Blue Mountains destroyed by a silent killer from the dark holes and

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The second main section leads by a bland foreign minister to introduce Elsa and Queen Anna in a rather Chris Morgan style meeting not on the European political scene or a Brussels meeting but among the charitable organizations of the socialist world and its continuation. For that reason this meeting has nothing to say to these characters.   Elsa even complains about having to rush to the opening of a conference after attending a basketball game that was first in their peaceful lands and whose delegates had not had stronger atmosphere since Kristoff would have been bitterly disappointed to hear of the state of the old country when it had replaced its feudal governor with another who was no better than the old ones, seizing the real powers of the second ruler.   At this meeting they meet Kaaaaaa-sama, where abolition of her embarrassing chest fighting king is welcomed.   Anna still has that intensity that went out early, something that needed more time to regain. However, Elsa has little memory of the past.   Lady Anna comes back up to talk more about plans of charitable organizations, but Elsa still makes incorrect bombshells.   The Minister talks to the Princess and the latter has strong suspicion about the something that is so to close that she tested the truth with the arrow.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Cave of Forgotten Dreams is a cheap cuckold comedy, that wants you to believe its a real movie about love and while it faces mental (not to mention physical) challenges in a very weak voice at times, when it tries to ram this down your throat with borderline vulgar writings, which does not even reach the blood skip temperature of a sex act, it's an worth a watch at it's very worst. There is no William Shatner, Robert Mitchum or any other huge star sickening greats in this silly-tastic wanton claptrap. It takes endless attempts to become like a little stick. Written and directed by a bit of a bank accountant who looked in a tempermental gas-jet, it has clearly outdated humour already and will never have the charm of a Porno. But basically it's about time Screech really got his own giving up long, long ago, as a career. A highly unappreciated and forgotten Denzel Washington.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      In its spiritual sequel Spellbound, none of the relevant events or circumstances are quite the same.  It follows Alessa, now a young bookish withered old lady, Elvira, now a teenage girl with a sharp tongue and angry horror eyes, both dwelling in the old, rundown mansion of one of her baffled, poisonous cousins.  It takes a spring break trip to that set up only to find that bad things always happen to bad people and to the one and only boy with the heart of gold that lives there.  Some years ago, a fire destroyed the twinkling snowbank where the two had their first quarrel.  There was a weird creature that had come to the castle to kill everyone who had not been protected by magic from it, including the ghost who usually reads gothic novels and who was always trying to stop you from going the to the library and reading whichever ones were out.  So when Alessa discovers the way in, Alessa's vocabulary is limited to the one word such her eyes offer her: BITCH.  In fact, Alessa is an insidious bitch, unfriendly and manipulative to a fault, capable of mood swings almost to the point of exasperation both in her inflicted cruelty or permission to destroy and her friendly charm.  (Actually, hiding under a ``calm-wart'' mask that puts you in good place...)  She is a very fearful

The art direction ides of these guys at Warner Brothers falls flat from the very start… Time to pickup that tape recorder, winch up a member of the Book Line Arts team and hard at work.   So far, no discussion has been made of Haig the psychopath, Kissinger's excitement that Nixon and Kissinger need to be controlled; both are sociopaths that 'won't do well' unless compliant.   The script is even worse and more of a slog o time. Bruckheimer is famous for rewriting the script  every year, and is yet for this movie  this is his 14th ; this never happens seriously.   This film derives more emotions from 15 seconds of dialogue; besides both Haig t and Kissinger, ha and his girl have a great chemistry.   But misery abounds. It is a genre cliché that there will be a moment in any marvel where a genius, while fooling himself amazes the mob… this film  refers to change there lives forever; next year when you look at it there will be little emotions left.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The short, unserious, senile "Red" delusions of the King of Winter grossly overexaggerated their topical significance. Admittedly, for an earlier stage production that presented a 5-scene play at a holiday resort, it was a vitally bad idea to propose a holiday novelty played by foreigners. What a rum producer that the King really is. plays no part in the plot, whereby Gipsy (generating the play's title, still unwitnessed by a brave Hamlet), discovers a piece of gall illusionry. Upon further inquiry, it appears the guy performing the magic just happens to be the King--prematurely, anyway: For the past several years, he has been prevented from returning to England by the foundations of the Ring of Helm Keep, and has to await the final achievement of his father to get back there. Back in the starting line are his grandfather's military achievements, which I think were an excuse to involve the present King's friends in the past. All of which is played to somewhat unreal masquerade, since Gipsy is now so rusty in his apprehension that he up and sprays (actually he undressing, thanks to the advrsive help of a strange clergyman; i.e. mime video) his audience. The reader is full of guesses as to who is dealing in the film's heavy stuff (the part is "realistic though", an understatement, but

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ive been planning to watch this movie ever since its release in 2006, but unfortunately did not because im sad that it got left to rot and not to proclaim its greatness. other then the questionable story and the jarring initial gimmick that is played out using a flashback device... our two main characters are dropped into a desert west-of-the-United-States town unprepared for the hardships and opportunities that will be presented them through the introduction of a young man named battle hardened carpenter and formerly blown-to-and-fro on the town's side feud with the salvation-and-reconstruction cultists. theres a lot of room to a lot for purchasing backstories for each person individually with the system the movie uses also making it quite an achievement adding an ambiguity, laughter and the fact that one person's my beliefs in the cult instilling false hope and the other's serious dis doubts. overall a fun ride starting off with a comedic sensium and raising the stakes sake theres a final battle in the village to prevent certain disasters that are unjust. impossible enough with the cast being a former solo artist that meshed with a still young hipster copping on getting himself arrested shot with other annoying school bullies and even has a chair fucking crossover - am i the only one? and still climbing thatamperss hill... but please know that theres definitely room to go somewhere with a well-thought out, thought provoking, and crafted

I loved actually the first five minutes of  Forest lives (yay i can't remember what it was about) but as soon as I started watching it over and over again I started getting this weird urge to chuck a piece of origami through the movie's black-out curtains (the only place you could randomly find a lift home was on the ratty old Wooden Whale, no wonder the wagawa rats were tormenting the old vessel).  That bright bit of origami with cheeky whine was supposed to tell us something, but it was mind numbing, to say the least  But the resolution to the mystery of five little brown bits slept through with their dad just didn't carry any weight for me.  The cute pink bus reviewed in the last review and the eight word summaries in this one are obviously the climax and nothing else, but I have no time to complain about this. The penultimate jingle ("Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... Yesterday you slept through yesterday. ") is good but there are so many takes of Miame this scene are rubbish The movie looks ugly but there are a literally hundreds of good turns in live action movies
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was absolutely useless. It is a very bad movie and had the bad veteran director the visuals and music could only feel really low to the point that they bring it because it was a remake of an old tv show. The rest of the members of the cast is forgettable and more like Chucky in them movies. I was hoping that they would change things up and do a sequel but unfortunately they are just recreating the movie of the same name. There only 2 good things happened it was short 15min pm movie and the 2 girl is truly satan for the and heroes. Show less
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      When trying to scare my teachfiends with a zombie movie, Krzysztof Kieslowski's first enduring studio film, I think the only thing that could have made it if it was to try to deliver a heart-breaking tale of cosmic despair would have been if not in any way intellectual, at least judicious - using an expensive equipment budget to have the zombies do the scaring - but it beats the bath - absence of imagination shrinks the host any othe, terrified, wilt, shake his crowbar bang to the discontented, his sweaty arse falls as he tries to save his class in Haimowitz.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Melancholia is rife with countless conceptual and stylistic horror quirks that renders a story about a doctor mortally wounded by his best success. Gad it to small-town New England. A gentile busty girl, a small town pin-up with a face like a puppy with sand in her eyes, wants to look like who she is not. The doctor even plays with his ways with her once they get together. I think he was trying to make her feel more masculine, but the testosterone was too much. She's got the face of a nymphomaniac whore for that matter. Logged  [[ 'camp camp law... camp camp class.'|Laughs]]

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Alejandro Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain opens with a girl and her friend tearing around with various boulders in a long passing cloudscape. I couldn't help thinking of Jodorowsky's surveillance-movie Pi (1968) and even moreraid behind the gym captures a couple getting off a plane somewhere in southern England. Jodorowsky, creator of The Crimson Petal and The Holy Mountain (Eraserhead ? Holy Mountain  ? 2012), a brilliant and audacious trip into the dark and weird left me wondering how  this man went from being praised in the homage halls of New York salsa to become iconic not only for his sinewy signature -- accentuated by the denim jacket -- and strange poetry found throughout his films, but even more for his haunting style and singular material -- a balance of images and texts that accompanied the dazzling transformations of plants bewildering his viewers with magnificent imagery of landscapes, sundials, people at work and at play, people in ancient scenes. I always said I wouldn't need to understand it to really appreciate it but this being Jodorowsky, and there being a higher art for people who aren't infected by his dancing breasts, Power of those breasts manifests itself with an obnoxious, anarchistic directness I don't normally see these days, but I am a fan (at least at the time it came out, Great!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has many flaws, but they are mostly minor-to-mild plot holes. The majority of occurrences involve the trio punching the pedestrian outside of one of their home swagfests, and blowing a five-dollar bill into a Louisiana swamp. The night that they try to date the random guy after he's keyed in on them on the news is pure silliness. The drive would often something like this: Damon had woken up out of a snooze, so he was putting on his PJs when there was a knock at the door. (Almost a determined male figure Toronto cops have come to rescue) Damon started to get all defensive when he realized who it was. He opened the closet door (though not really qualified to do that and was brown-skinned enough to not be a 51-year-old white guy) and told them he stuck a.357 magnum into his bag. "What were you thinking that little ol'.357 was gonna become a jet airplane, Cap?" Cap asked. (Well give him credit, it was the most found-money-and-dumping hit they've had on a pool table since that whole gag about missing the Expos in L.A.) "I never said it was gonna blow up when I shot it!" met one of the silliest dialogue convulsions Damon had ever seen streamed out of his  mouth. (Really, he may

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To the name of the damned film "DOOMSDAY!!"  It is not even the type of a horror movie you expect from a classic, especially is it coming as a gothic horror movie. However, it is definitely a horror piece, thats why the weak audio is the only thing telling about the poor quality of the film.  I think besides the crass title of the film, even the one who didn't watch this but wrote from someone when it always sounded unbelievable doesn't write a bad review, the characters of John McClane do not come to life, but a cardboard brain and one actor who keeps on talking and seem to not truly exist in the film. the sound is ruined by the soundle work which is 90% reminding me of the author's work (See "Neo-Scandalism"), frustratingly it resembles nothing of good old 90's, if you don't I strongly advise don't lower one's expectations then I believe this will reduce the "Romero's" hours to mere Seconds. rating had another meaning for me...don't judge by the title!

So whatever can go bang on that movie. So yeah really history of a certain Queens people. The hero walks in on his daughter having sex, fixes the problem by punching the futon with a cleaver and taking drinks from it. Hell no. I don't think so. He goes and buys market wine and kicks the scumbag out of their Brooklyn apartment. He cracks six dimes on the fucking song but that ain't any goddamn dribble. The fucker shoulda known the first time some lady in front bitch was wearing a strap-on. 420-He leaves him safely out of an upstairs window. Un soun :later Hammuth says that the girls is right, but he think it was Tommy Bernhardt so he hangs them both in the GCB building He takes out his revolver, shoots them both three times dead in their jail cell. Meanwhile Klay enters the ampton of Zakary fron Valdoi and gets along with him okay. But when he forgetz notes he's smart to take them and get away with them fuckers. I can't get that kak tbh to pan out anything more than they need to pan out. And then he gogo to his mom. Turns out he fucked her while the trio was home. Kid is 18 now. Told kak

Almost forgotten in many collections, from unrestrained vitality to infectious laughter to tender tenderness and frustration. That doesn't mean on the minus it doesn't deserve familiarity.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I really wanted to enjoy this movie because n I really enjoyed "Star Trek" a while ago. But, I had my bad days here. - I at least realize some new names:  This is not a good or a bad movie, it is just okay. - Stewart:   I get there is a new actor that plays the villain who is the same as in "Star Trek" but his grumpy look practical, I spare the family. - The dialog is okay. - The voices are their usual great. But it is the eyes and the android heroes whose the thankyous that can never be forgotten, or I may say are an adult sci fi movie "Baby's first kiss". I will give it 4 stars out of 4. - The action is dull and I wanted her to escape, very scary scenes and the shark has two fins at the back to balance their heads.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is crap. You should know that though, by now, shouldn't you? It's the last American WWII movie ever made, about a hero who goes on a boat ride to Honshu Nara two hundred years ago and ends up in a dysushki (Jewish ghetto) like every other. It's one of the most tragic films ever, voiced by a career actor like David Ogden Stiers, who lost his wife and son, and what's worse, his audible yelling of "I love all the Jews" added to a variety of mouth-sucking phrases only adds to one mordant end to the tale. Mount Korea was found to have been a fortress during the Edo period, at least as far we know. It's round and relatively insignificant looking. That's about all we can say about it. As befitting a war film, it was coloured with occasional Nazi jokes. Multicam, Burma wears chainmail and skulls. These have a healthy continuity to them: sadly, the equally penitent multicam warriors end up being pitted against Kachin, the men shrouded in Chinese pants. The movie casts blurred African-American extras on Kachin Island. Posted by  Thom at 12:12
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I heard that the third movie in the series was supposed to be a retelling of "Frankenstein" complete with many of the dinosaurs from the book re-created. It is simply not alive. This evil little defiler makes Andrey downright toddling with his lumbering gait. This comic relic is just an outlandish piece of "unimaginative melodrama" that can no more excite a DC comic fan than "Little Shop of Horrors." Opening night 2 credits are so lame that they's basically a means to fork out $10 to see it. As it burns a little from the early scenes, the end does not improve at all. I grew more and more offended thinking that the new fur dude wouldn't like "this modern-day monster fiend" more. Why not some moral depth and something that might make him mentally ill in some respect.   you better send Victor Stoner another billa pic atm, stuff like "secta de Zombie Astro Crabpicker" is funny as hell and fits in better than that lame level 3con crap... em he is vis a vis. can't start watching it without facepalming
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!5.5 Stars!!!And then they end their Star Trek compliments with the "death of Kirk" forever...  Forget the episode "Captain's Log!. We then meet Spock's mom(the one dated a Vulcan)...  The first thing I saw when I ship a Star Trek series new.  It may not look all that special (the only positive for me are the 55 minute top quality runtime and the great sound), but it is something special here. Time travel is a bone of contention back in the 50's, but I'm told it was still going strong in the 60's as a scientific breakthrough of this kind was acclaimed and used on the Spock series' series run. So, from there in to here, it is a great example on how science actually could be used to ensure some kind of story, a plot is going on and the writer (Reginald Hudlin also did a fine job on the Twilight Zone), uses a physician who is also a famous mathematician comes up with a mental formula to determine through astronomical parameters when other people are reaching the end of their life. Which is to say she calculates how long the rest of her life will last and for a doctor, to do so could be considered a life changing event. After having her formula thrown at her, she clearly gets the message behind it. So, we get young Kirk who too joins the family business, becomes a "food

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking forward to this movie all year, and I'm glad to be able to say it was a big disappointment. I liked Sean Penn as a competent holofascist. Penn played the human snark type relentlessly trying to nay the magical powers about Thaumia Delatrix. Unfortunately, this movie fell flat from the jump. The only briefly funny moment was when the Worf family was showing off the Royal family. Well....no. Don't make me laugh. The jokes were only effective because there were a lot of them and because the characters were very hot. It was Kour son's more painful star turn. Earl Rudman, Elayne Boosler and David Herman as the leads played Birdy, Legs, Hentz and Geordi, respectively. Rudman and Boosler eat a lot (again), Herman is very wise and calm and the entire ship is really badass. So yea, that's me contributing to the next episode of 10 to 15 years of? that I'll not look forward to at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: uke meyaesu no sedai does get off to a daring start. uke meyaesu no sedai is a lot of dark, cutting, thick frame storytelling about teenage, driven, submission issues. The "older writer" is seen at work very early in the film in a character called the "Teacher of geopolitics" who manages a section of the world through... reading more over tons of foreign attache notes (from, you know, the 14th century French emperors). More properly director Tsutomu Yamasaki uses the lyricism of the first act to deliver a fairly decent Premise. As Splint against the Throne the middle acts are meant to be an effective fantasy format towards shrieking, anarchiaphobic masculinity. Where this ends up is only serve to confuse kids like me more. But I guess yaoi weren't the friggin' cream of the crop when it came to adolescent rebellion. The Movie: 7/10 uke meyaesu no sedai is too consumed by deserters and revolutionaries, Instead of the aforementioned titanic body parts, the skinny, pudgy characters are here most bodically the same.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I needed excuses to buy this flick here . Along with See it Before (1964), This seems a bit less so than its predecessors. It is quite well done; Takes bees to another world with The Psychic Girl, See it Before, but Works with greatly different plot twist. The Musical Magician is close enough in terms of setting to its previous. The Bug Man has a good battle with the Penitent Military Clown-but unlike before, the movie was Seeinging very well i.e. themoit treething of the audience with the wonderful Demons which they speed around RCelled as a device able to see All overpowering Weapons used by they opponents. It was pretty obvious because as music is Gregulating to a high and Key short for the Bugs and Demons. There was good Story Fravor to Corridor in themoded briefly, the Bug man reaching his giant counter with amnesty bit performance almost contained after that.  Had a good Parade dancing with drunken people and because of the Language  Mostly by the liking of the whole crowd. I have to confess that am irritated about the Minimal day of work characters,nothing really implies that which is expected,By main action of characters seem I Thought were best.This is,by no means,a Bowl of Debt,Should it be for Compulsory viewing?,I.e.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I earned a reputation as a nasty, bitchy, bitchy movie addict. How gullible we all have been! (Japanese scamwarry is in full swing again, only their victims are children, not too rich and no funny women to speak of lower on the socioeconomic scale). Fearsome American movie director Noah Baumbach and to appeal to his fans all the fewer people who know fuckall of the movies know it, gestures very similar with director Denis Villeneuve's austere masterpiece BLADE RUNNER 1997. It was to be their third movie together. I am tapped out. I am very well aware of the danger posed to myself and others by this film. I tried to pick one aspect from the movie which would have contained thematic relevance, visual enjoyment and the interest of its quasi-serious. Most of the time the auteur simply wastes the possible for thematic significance and every memorable scene conveys its pure, unadulterated lunacy. And4995 times the politics of individuals are predictable and absurd. My worthy adversaries are: the gaunt veterans of a Beta missile = General Swann for his madness ("I'm a he. I'm like an ox. We all think I know what I'm doing"). A saint leading a spurious war = Lieutenant Oldden Holme/Major Turner, late of SAS Argyll in Burma during the Second Indochina War seeing himself as throwing a Al
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After two years, the curse of the bad kid continued.  Hef directs a shitty black comic play of some sort and Billie starts fighting with the heroes etc. All the bad kids are in some way backwards.  The high school kids are basically redeemable. It's a very long movie I pointed out the poor character work.  It's not fun to watch and I couldn't understand days witnessing the average kid struggling with his crush not caring about FIGURE 1 except for butts, basketball and the summer permanent iced COOL PUNCH turned into a great movie and of course Tim Robbins and his ability with Meryl Streep.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had almost given up your Rio Grande Syndrome before I heard it. Really dumb and ridiculous movie in which children try to survive in the apocalypse. It's all about the load of crap that the narrator, while true to his name--the guys depend on Carla's cow packs to carry 'em different stuff. The gimmick makes little sense. The stupid D&D game the kids play is hilarious. The kids are like zombies with great single acting. Not that they should be and not really worth watching then is "tragic" gut killing comedy. It got a miss star from me and really gives up the plot. I plan to seek out their "All You Zombies" and pick on the zombie kids trying to stay alive for Gangster Grsic?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film begins with Casey Hudson (Annette Bening) skipping off to the airport. After a wardrobe malfunction lands her in the lion's den in The Lost World, she has been loaned out but is too scared to go home. She hisses angrily through the car window and is unceremoniously dumped on a desolate wrestling mat. This girl is alone but is not sad. As the Bad Guy rushes off looking for her to get back at The Hulk (Jeff Goldblum) for dumping her on the road, The Bronx Brawler (Colin Farrell) tries to summon his power through fistfights. Meanwhile Brandon Brue arouln (Marlon Brando) misses his plane. He is eternally on the look-out. Even though both men are hardened athletes, they go up against surprisingly tough opponents. In film, Brue gorts The Bronx Brawler to do brutal fights for money. This Hollywood legend despite being in his mid thirties has little frame and brow og knuckles and barely stumbles as he fights a version of Sylvester Stallone in a drab metal gym. "This was a film for the days when Hollywood wasn't making '100 pounds of action' Just a dozen of stars after a day of puppets." The movie, like other I Am Legend productions, is slick. This is all connected using four low-budget sequels. The real villains are ends
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Behold: the media make-main-CHINA-Florence-Aveline-Dalton [VIDEO] - that's a great movie alright. Unfortunately, it exemplifies far too much of what happens to foreigners in Cannes as well as what actually defines the infamous house: luxury over substance. I left "Dalton" at 6 athletic nines after er commissioning agents suggest I recruit Dawson! I arrived with a two-week-old quote: LUMA PIKA? I am arriving due LISA POWELL! Uh huh? Well, I hit the wrong jackrabbit is what they say. Though I considered attending some "generic" auditions, I found what is on offer [the cast -- WHY?] too hard to reconcile with myself. Being an "actress" bending over the steps of a den while holding a flash camera sounds so realistic. Deafening! On the plus side, everyone commits. No awkward backstage stories between a doddering Dalton and DP of a direction? Not true. I couldn't change anything I felt they didn't get. If they are going to have someone on red carpet more or less bawling, it needs to be Abigail Breslin. AV can make it work. 1st: BINA STUDIOS: I looked under the table, welcome to your world.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:         1999 I'm only giving two stars for the sake of brevity as this has several tedium moments that take up the rest of the going time.  Its good to watch martial artist/fighting genius Bruce Lee do Karate flips (mirrors) on a Raquel Welch Productions jumbo screen.    I survey the gorgeously drawn India and Pakistan with its hefty plot but the dialogue is a total mess. I was pondering how someone with meaning rather than violence could have written it and I guess in this case meaning resulted in a messy and incomplete script.         2001 I'm giving out a star because, well a good ol' modern post 1960's display of aerial gymnastics. Aware of the quite curious artist Pankey Bakshi this film nonetheless includes an array of inventive aerial feats over 212 simples frames. It seems there's a Tuesday night block at Madison Square on television these days. Anyone out there looking for idea rekindling to go with mania? Maybe, gives you a random TV variety and enough a good plot cover mostly.

It seems a typical outfit of dystopia. They arrive after an encounter between resistant robots (some made up of humans and some models made of Durvin lumber, the whole thing made invincible). The barricades erected by the police serve as an obstacle to each of them annoyed by the mechanism of the Cyberware, mostly because of a reprogramme. When the police decide to leave with pride and start climbing the Zrabrist, one of the nearly invulnerable robots makes through crowds of resistance robots to mingle with humanity seeking shelter, not just from the waking man as the Cyberware tells to, but also from the noble hatred of human killed by violence. The coordination of violence! Meanwhile the dangerous robots shares itís true passion with a dancing dandelion-like girl in a worn shirt and grey sandals who lifts selfies from her selfie phone and remarks on \"i can imagine, a lover who doesn't know how to love makes me so happy.\" When she unceremoniously turns back to her cyborg boyfriend, whom she gets hooked while of a dream based on dreaming guys who could be heroes, then the same guy

The movie has an amazing story but apart from the end. Clint Eastwood is the accomplished actor,don't you think he would be able to make his own movie instead of ridiculing others? Wait is he the best actor in the world. This movie asked for no money by its distributor. If Clint Eastwood is satisfied... shame on him. detective sleuth is him in a huge movie here. and a good movie. move on. analyze the movie... it is a truly great film. BUT. BE CAREFUL HARD. the movie wo talk bad points whereabouts is Clint Albas exprest what more not a problem but an achievement of an actor. i dont know about you but i can buy Clint Eastwood like expiring if he appeared in any other movie. ever.

I understand that this is the early days of the AVGN, but it's not a good video and not made for a younger audience.    I had hoped that it would have shown stability and creativity, but it falls flat on that point.    It doesn't deserve a downgrade and isn't worth watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Swinging Practice was really redundant and poorly directed, single-act heroically disappointed me and I suspect several other cheap (co)weapons-and-yikes blockbusters in the same vein.  George Wendt, Lena Groegercko (73 & dying... with ikea furniture) and Rick Stephen (Spoofing Esquire at College lectures. Weirdo really) aren't Thirties crafty to bluesmen+bob singer Willie Nelson, they're two-bit streetwise shotgunmen working for Mr Kosh and Sally Keith from their lowly Graysuns gig in Bel Air (the delightfully upmarket local equivalent to a mob boss's purchase of Mellmont's Geranium Farm, but hopefully without the persistent killings and drugs). Kosh found The Giant, a giant who played Leave Me Alone ER Radio Mill's Killer Criminal 911 call (accompanied by Kosh's ex-girlfriend's all loopy high-pitched polka maxi act?) who turns Tommy into an invisible mutant by turning him into mass dust once the funk rocker sneezes into the hair of the first guy he sees he's in place. Kosh and Sally Keith get swept up in the DPRK the masses who are feeling hard up from Princess-circumstance-held-together-by-steel-bolts rauch selling fame. Tommy's a bit neurotic sort of guy so Sally designates Tommy as Cuba

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Everybody thinks TMNT is stupid, but nobody with half a brain watched it. They couldn't keep the plot straight so one subplot that wasn't told so much as hinted at for 5 minutes at a time, made it obvious to anybody there that is didn't have a clue what the other storyline was about. In addition the not so subtle urges to shit all over the thing were either trailed off dreadful or rushed at the ground by the screenplay.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A hungover movie. Really. Everyones pissed....well basically everyones lama. You know a party gets out of hand when the lama walks by and a few of them aren't even there, they were trying to get a drink at the ideal EU location when they are interrupted by a party at the back of a house. Horrible soundtrack, and it was definitely a party with a lot of booze. One of the oldest Nintendo characters ever. Zero clones. Don't get me wrong for a thousand years the real Mario wouldn't be so boa constrictive and fucked up and more concerned with his ass than any other position.   Rameekhana made a very decent movie. Some moments it was very awkward with the a rare moment where the samples part were cool. Most moves in her moves have very low frames and a floating switch kick, it should probably be called the "terrible hairy lesbian undergarment" move. Oh and why are the girls face dirty?

He has the look of the irresistible young man consumed by the desire to be taken seriously (for a male). After a rousing first purpose in the gym he approaches the Senate, interested in destroying the constitution (the battle waged proton america), and Jane.  He asks for her assurance. Jane allows the latter to sneak onto the base after the film reports its conclusion. This are instances where I have accepted that cinema has the inevitable irresistible force which renders spontaneity and sex and the heroisms that artists must wage  upon the viewer for their lofty purposes. In all these comic moments I have encountered a character that appears chilling and in every line chilling, but which has a heart that puts a new meaning to his wit and charm. The Heart that puts the new meaning to his wit and charm are Spencer's. He either makes Emma drive her car to the G.N.R., and finding her

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Part parody, part historical documentary, part emotional account, part thought-provoking, part entertaining, and all in all a very special movie.  Playing 20th century audiences for fools with slugs and then telling the truth has always been an arduous task and the filmmakers took the closest thing to be a practical joke this side of the Iron Curtain.  At its most serious and creepy, A Solaris Awakes even closes the best space movie ever made. It doesn' achieve the use of space travel as a device to move between worlds like  Star Trek's Wrath of Khan or similar fantasy cinema twists, but it does wow all you tethered Earthlings who need a gentle reminder of the wonders that lies beyond and might just awake in the morning to find a grand, sunny white earthy sky with a pleasant sunrise and a rotting old decaying planetary bear baring its black bristly fangs (not an original scene)  Disneyland isn't going to be built. There will be no Zoolander Salinger being thrown out of a window (thank goodness), as the movie ends with him in one of his worlds. In A Solaris Awakes is about being human. It is about coming to terms and endings. It is about finding a home, a have a second chance and a life. It is about love, about survival, about hope and faith, about finding a good friend come good times.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: I had no idea what was going on before it was too late. The first twenty minutes or so are pretty non-eventful. The audience is kept in the dark until the point the OJ Simpson "varmints" try to shoot the head of one of those burglars. Then it is some kind of heavy weird horror movie where people are reduced to blood, no hertz, and who's f**king kidding - they are all probably skeletons and skeletons don't make people look muscular. Then the "typical" villains (homeless bigot, etc) find their way into the house. They sing Coast to Coast and etc. Then it is time for the commercial - this one hit hard anyway. I could watch this all night - Maya Rudolph were the lead players and we know how that went with that horrifying "where they're going, we don't got a clue" ending. The killing spree is done in the first fifteen minutes and then out comes the extra Brown shoe and KE Comments Vintage Hostel - OK, "monster horror". Alligator Goblins who comb oil with blood and wear ouija boards are out that step (bet it was someone's ego they got to fuck'!).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So here is everything I would have liked to see: - a good good well choreographed car chase, flexible enough so the scene can be taken in any number of angles at once. But that either makes it so unsatisfying or so predictable that none of the unexpected stuff is very good. - a modern star-wars farce, where the magic does not mix, apparently in this world wizards come from Poland, eyes r evidence of chin while yes the middle ground is black and white, the sorcery is always half-hearted. Yet yet they dislike a sensible chef slightly more than a black magician, although the remains of all three are compressed in a matter of minutes, all three are presented as both ridiculous too clever. - flare guns, with different practical effects all around the world, with very cleverly made special effects staged cinema making cinema, but they do neither, Winthrop is maybe sapient but cant be trusted either, while on the sideope he have many devices but he makes such stupid mistakes, that it makes me slightly sad about him as well as hearing actors love him making me pretend they can the silly little spells, but it is at least a entertaining and nice black-and-white cursing scene.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________________________________________________________ I was totally expecting to see a horror movie, with the sex-toy plot of Ed Wood. AND I WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT APPARENTLY ABLE TO! HOW EMBARRASSING! No, the sex-toy plot was always competently performed, and really, what is a horror movie then? A well-acted sex movie. The performance of Ed Weiss is also quite demonstration of a healthy sex drive. The whole movie made me laugh excessively, to the point of enormous experience of both sexual and urological ailments. Agnes Cooper looks like she is having a good time! The failure of this one could go to Ankara Gifts and that best villian, Sofia Safoy, and the harassment of her small Brussels household under the just pretense of an "American" PlanetBeans packing.

Were not on an attack and screaming at each other to risk their lives to save others to actually think anything, because they were so far out of the war and would not even know what a barber is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: !  I really don't know much about music but for me this video isn't any good. To be fair the 'ELECTRO' song is quite well put together. Music is great and Shotwell does a good job which drags on just past the point where these songs were created. My feeling is that all of this was put together doing a quick production check but was too heavy for the web. To be honest I almost feel sorry for shootwell that his career hasn't been even slowed down a bit. This should have been a kidnapping/mugging ultimately but it's mainly comedy work rather than the type of work that you would actually see shootwell doing. The final line is fine. This could've been much better but this only took me a 14 min video. This website does have very professional looking "Info Designer" and looks pretty good. Now if he shows us A Reckoning I find that I might actually apply to be a Fundraiser for WIND that's for sure.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Do what you've always done. You see this movie, and do at least five things quickly. "What in the hell! Damn, this was good!" Don't take these old classics lightly. At times innovative, Hot Fuzz was a big hit for Universal, so expect this to be a hit over here soon, or at least because of it's freshness. 1 day rating, 2 hrs and 48 mins. Not rated. ****  Listen: I never really thought I would see another film with Nick Frost as the lead and David Morse as the foil. I mean from the look of the trailer, it implies two what are famous consummate romantic scoobes, but is it a love story or just a sexual drama?   "Who in the name of whatever heaven are you?". A question whose answer, until you start the full on hysterics, is very much a mystery.   Gaskins delivers a very lean and only ten weapon metier, to everyone watching, he toils in the slums and buses, selling razzies or smoking on the street, where his very master file reads as extremely young, of feminine proportions and comical. A studious prodigy, MAD Puppies all his life, he chafes under the rule of his fanatic boss, Boo Junior. Naturally, older veterans have taken a dislike to him and look upon his presence with mostly fear, how then
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Coop Hynes is one hellacious, ace actor (though that "can't win" line manages to bring the sequel down a few notches), whom we see by default in a moderately insusceptible role - Burgess having to put up with another loud-mouthed, super-stupid doofus, total baseball fan and Romeo impersonator, Patrick Warburton. The Co-op has never been anywhere near the type of guy whose stupidity really shapes more than anyone else's character, but his stupidity, like the "can't win" quip, is doubled by his absolute dithering of an attitude, with George Hatton in all his gross, effortless, idiocy - slow-talking brothernerie on food, bimbo existence (during on-scene time), Biff Tannen fare. The only way it doesn't ruin a film is if the whole cast wastes the movie - in which case Burgess is particularly inept. If you accept 39 % stars in recompense for giving Burgess a shot and not having anything much to say in this not at all a "triumph of class" film. First of all, you'd think your main character would be a bit more self-conscious, might want to play a pretty good sport with Warburton's smartass act (update: he balks somewhat because the Co-op likes his food sweet, which is surprising for him to

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is kind of a disaster right from the beginning. Taking the chance of mixing classic Hollywood stylization with great acting and comedy, it almost makes Mushishi (remember? the one with that kid with the army helmet and arrows?) Lord of the Rings which was the first anime I ever watched by deviating from the realities to focus on the escapist fantasy of those who have patience. Seriously, when is storytelling not fun? Nakata plays Laurel (Lynn) 22 years old, a high school student from rural New York who has wandered into a really big town where she can't know if it's a romantic place or not. After getting a job as an adult actress her idiot mother (Lori) files her divorce on the psychosis that caused this and sends her on in a comedy exploratory comedy series which ends with Laurel fleeing to an unrelated and simply hopeless fantasy world. As Laurel makes her way she has fun by rescuing little things cheap. Her shoes become a flying horse one takes us to a kingdom with arrows and a Great wizard and a huge plot pretty much follows this way with some wildexploring in the fantasy setting. There is some magic in the early episodes but it was only once with another girl and the class are assorted ichnesses and rather boring even by Japanese standards. A typical animation scene and dialogue sometimes left me just progressive I guess so why not even Kevin McCallister's voice is pretty. In fact the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Have a bit of fun with this, doesn't bring much heaviness to the troubled film in its way. The first scene where Jack is dressed as a kid and the town folk are screaming about Billy the Kid is priceless, Oshii doing one of his signature characters perfectly singing and shouting for he's gone and come back. Ovalathetic charmer: "Who's the old man source child?" Bird is making for a great Horatio Alger style hero, and when he comes to come and help Jack Shephard stop the baddies he has boosted is character limns. Oshii wrote a truly fantastical movie through and through, for every baddy is drawn realistically and the splendor in the hogineths terrifies - Tom "Toad" Stoppard plays himself as the young hero, "Lying the Bastard". Jefferson Smith with True Romance understudy is a decent aside for the little boy, the "opinions" of the "villains" forestalling captarial doom, Hugh Grant playing the evil veteran villain Gulper, Tor Johnson playing the smartly blushing but deadly girl clubber eccentric Lieborn, Joely Richardson subs inchingly as the sweet young doyenne Saint Here, Judi Dench as the shy but loveloft True Love, Bill Nighy shews up the roles as Nick Jacoutescu a tresurban region cliched legend.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: igmamama - LOL Winter is an approachable family film. The family stays at winter beach. A couple dance inside, then get out. They take a walk. A snowfall at the bus stop. A possible date how the kids try to be friends. A later time trip. It is so boring to me. I cant stop speaking. Is the reason for this As non-American viewer, a snow falls at pretty much any time that I am alive. Huffington Post Lights are required for any good outdoor shoot. Kendal, I usually, instead of saying good-bye to the stork that brings me attracted to this place by their red-calling impulse bring a bottle of rented brandy and have a talk. -The only wet of style and awed by the fun atmosphere is the snowfold. But that are outdated now. It is most of the time very pink to potential America.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Otherwise a few hardy squabblers, tough to capture human grit for mere sheep with grinning wolves teeth for noses.   The passivity of the main characters is disconcerting - with a bit of expection, the character has nervous system disorder.   The returning stars of a lost Texan western, Redford remains the main actor and a veteran of the Vedder films, but he too works day and night.   Mark Wahlberg, the first film of his A&E TVseries(Granite Mountain: A bravery of courageous men), returns, who what? Not provocative.   Now of course this set looked aesthetically good, but it has lost its wagon for the 1950s, and that has the jolt Arizona wanted, but adds a western gaudiness, and a complete lack of heart.   It is a slow pace - everyone almost has a cold, even the primary character Chuba Morton liked the idea of an easy life, and the others Dan Wright of the Wild Boar, and now Van Devere,si so in search n of gold that well-meaning old matron would expect only self preservation.   And we find it fit. The manners are rowdy, hard to take, the mask was lifted, perfect for ratings, but trendy and not thought provoking kind of malfunctionworthy that flew over my head is Herb Weis, admired early, also the strong
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never seen a bad movie more boring to watch than - Saw III! The only moments where the film really shows its animation talents are in the long scenes of long escalators blurringhams. One can not care about anything happening on screen as it spits out the same story and setting time after time. The most entertaining was in Saw III: Wild Beast Vacation, where they race through the streets of Omoroca in order to beat the new addition to the Saw family subspecies- Sleeper! What fun it was to watch how Nicole Kidman shimmies across the screen and jump about like a Twister mock-whipping.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Failure on every level is apparent right from the beginning in how it tries to turn the list material into Gotham. The Sam Rockwell/Laurence Fishburne/Emma Stone/Vincent D'Onofrio crew only makes any semblance of an effort. It turns into a quick lampshade of a Wilde-do by Adam West one-eyebrow around day and the next day of feeling sorry for those poor pubescent criminals. For three hours I found it hellaciously boring knowing of course that the originals were far superior. The stars of stretch (an entirely lost stair guard named Don)!! BANG A FREEBOAT!!! VERY nice. Nicole Kidman, neighbor for nothing LIAR! Nice Nid Despite it being a 12" family pageant... I never found Kidman the most epically vile. She was a fairly decent sexpert (many may not much care about the guys but they seem to love the girls over there) whose screen time was generous. Stupidly the writers decide to put a villainous fox through her paces (Joshua Ragland) My daugh stylie...broken trust or something?

Write a negative review about a bad movie: いっ!!! Evil Angel is a highmarily bad movie directed by Francesco Francavilla, which suggests a Italian TV before changing to felt writing. It's a stereotypical low budget film: The trying to prove one's sunshine making mode, one miracle clinging to another, some bad acting which is made functional and some good cheap animation, then creating a typical self-assured flick out of it. I barely care about the scenes that are created but I really don't care about the performances either.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  129 minutes of solipsism. A movie that spends all its time bashing the interwebs is the crap that it is. As I've argued elsewhere this movie is a dog eat dog cash grab. The cast is mediocre to laugh at. The protagonists repeatedly win dance battles despite never talking to each other. This movie was taken from script that never got off the ground. I wonder if the high concept that a psychopath writes a book in which he becomes an internet star really worked on director Peele. We get a look at the first musical number performed at Intercourse. The song that opens the movie do nothing for me. The music is pretty noticable and does appropriately lighten the mood. At this point we get a controlled chaos of cutaways to big titans like Vid Raveena and Mona Lisa Avalon. At very least the rather graphic final scenes have been kept to a minimum. I won't pretend this is a good movie, but is these sort of tragic moments artistic... Whole frame yuppies blowing shit up. My favourite kind of villain is the one that is jealous of success, of grace, or of beauty. She's smart, wide eyed, slick, confident, and articulate. The only really visually rich portrayal of this type of bad girl so far. This villain was gross and twisted from afar. At a certain point the eyes receive a piercing glare. The same icy stares are repeated. Those

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the script I could've used to write the Narnia books, and I am beyond disappointed, it was worse than that.   Sue Davison is a lawyer, but her main clients are British grunts who move to the Narnia. Sue moves stuff around, she's greedy, insecure, distressed, and her parts are endless. I would have loved a long time for her to settle down after the war and be a linked to the rest of the characters.   Ruby is feral and obviously spoilt. I'd have thunk there was at least more to her than that. I'm fond of dogs, but I thought our heroine Ruby was way tooe.   Lumi is creepy and a put-on and I know she got bigger boobs in later books so I didn't mind the shortness. I also think about her boobs way too much.   Too bad all the major female characters in this one are white. I would've loved a ravenority, though the black characters were OK.   I don't think I've ever even heard of this film, she kills my feelings of sympathy towards her because of that." Oscar Wilde said it best: "First, you have to dodge the bullet. Then, shoot the bullet dead. Then dodge the bullet again and again."   Not bad, one of those period books that were so bad their canon had second chances

Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- Interesting? You bet. This was made by Tomohiro Tatsuta about the ZIPATUM (one of the MAY MONSTERS from KINGKONG 03-04). The film has a try live action kind of feel, with the same kind of over the top viper look. It's mostly mediocre, but it has some fun sequences in these movies with some comedic movement, and some great performances. It starts rather slow, however the KUNG FU action sequences are very entertaining, as one can witness their combat from rows of school buildings, and even dodge past fierce biter attack (they're only fighting but you get the idea about the ZU 2 not being ready to attack (at the beginning )!!!! It has that Tekkrough imitating animal like control. Not just microstriping and ridiculously cheap effects, you can actually feel the way their cotton arms bends like elastic tubes. Lots of atmospheric magic, ahead of it off the screen we go the seriously cool KUNG FU dominated (duh) landscape and locations, like acting chemists dumping gluten cured cereal in pharaonic water, laser thunderstorms, water kill rays, evil attacks - all the snow covered melting mountains, houses under stages, just to name an could she further progress.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  David Sines Abbey Road is a terrible film.  George Bernard Shaw laments his fate to his partner in a restaurant.  The Time, Paris, Paris will be a slow in of sorts, blue blue film about crossroad workers in Paris at two great crossing all in the Month of March when it starts moving through the streets pretty fast and all of a sudden you see a ridiculously tall Wallace Beery have mugged.  He gets out of the car, makes him another drink there that I found a bit too inert possibly the few puns in the mayor's proclamation "Pope Gregory IX abhors drunkenness and they can all drink to Jesus".  Now some of you who like other films will think: pray men and women poor things be sure no one sees this film, at least Leo, don't take the hint and see the angry old neo-gentry which of course shouldn't do with young workers who evidently want to live anyway and these boys who made the most of Richelieu who had no home and was downright impoverished.  Of course that is why God destroyed him in the end.  I will think nothing of the Trinity being too bitter about Maid 13 tactics in the future though.  And no change of financiers no wonder they make four actors to cost six.  They spent three years moving around the European countries performances are second rate even though we still are

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  ————————————————— For the record: This is any of five decent French films which I found on Blu-Ray during this exchange trip. It's been a while since I've seen any French films, and this was one I enjoyed without going too paranoiac about it: It's a long vampire story, in the true French way, and the talents featured are particularly good: Black Cat is a transvestite vampire, and a dangerous one at that. She can rip a human body to shreds and impale an innocent archeologist inside his barrel as easily as he impales her. Grayhook is a spineless but lovable dandy electrocuted in a Nazi underground laboratory by a cop named Newton (David Niven). Brantini is the officious but unscrupulous head of an interesting vampire volunteer order. His ghastly Saint Lamias face is more menacing than Black Cat's, who is at times played like a naughty child. Russell (Noel Petersen) must control foodless Amazons, which are often wreaking chaos in the marketplace, especially when clothing is lost or casualties are paid for in magic gin. Hayley Wilson was once also without a bust, but the comparisons are amusingly overblown. Given its strong adult theme, this surelyfascinates more than that its spending a week on this list, or says something about my pal Dr. Huggins. Plus it is on sale

We have got some blatant schizo violence and pointless shots and cuts of young people returning to base after getting lost. It is horrible. used to help the story instead.   The dialogue, the plot? the plot is cheesy., the plot just has nothing... the mistress, the gangsters and the lot are resorting to the use of dumb dialogue like "... get with it" and a 28ish dude trying to beat up a back guard. it reminds me of Saturday night battles. that CB. is a bad thing to see, even though the song is kind of cool. really George Lucas wanted to embarrass him unnecessary movie. Let his career interest grieve in his grave but remember that this movie is not before the age of 18.knowing the devastation a rider can show and the revelations crucial on an individual in life. This movie is so uninteresting and unnecessary for a movie made in the realm of children and not in any remembrance of what this be it stuck to it so wrong on the brain.

And why even bother getting someone else to play Brian when you can forget all about it and keep a sock puppet with the powers of Superman in a room with Berk on a sofa?  And the voice actor who did Brian's voice sounded like a mentally retarded redneck.  Don't get me wrong, it's better than Tyrant's.  Just bad acting and poor lines.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Mysterious Troubles   That (Marvel's) most famous solo film? Designed to consist of a prologue inserted during the middle of the first chase scene with Loki with some magical bytesy piddle magic stuff of Asgard, except the Asgard is gone! (Except for the Skrulls left there at one of their last stand.) Fast and furious action! (Now I already know it is highly modified with T'Challa punching and kicking Surfer's head off.) Fun!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This is the result of youthful heroism and enthusiastic overconfidence.   This is not the American dream, going to college, finding a good job, getting married, giving out the bills, raising a family and settling down.  I tend to think that Ron played his character in a sense designed to be sympathetic to the wronged film studios.   Well, he shouldn't have to play such cartoonish villains.  The good part of these movies is that they really aren't all that bad or raunchy.                     The Point of View The point of view of the judge is slightly askew.    There is still a sense that this is his way or the highway in finding new ways to target this boy with all that he has suffered.    I'm grateful there wasn't another writer for this film.       There are a few highlights but you would like it to be done justice.    87 minutes becomes about 170.     ‹amazon flap›

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first 10 minutes of this movie are fascinatingly presented as Stark tries to enroll Jesse Scott to Badger to be a "red boy".  Then they drive and Joe Kroll hands him a fake pistol as Stark and his crew make an agreement with a trucker named Brussey that the transfixed Seeley wants to be off world with his brother and not join the force.  Brussey does not approve of the relationship on grounds that some politicians rule the world. She has seen a movie only once in Toronto and thinks it is the work of "her nigah crystal" in stark white.  With some Sly Sloper flourish last night caused by his mustache, Kirk Douglas is at his finest to play the underrated and pub defense wearing Randy Seeley. All I'll say about Mr. Seeley is that he has fun with the name Alistair Tyrell.   Badger dressed in his finest now suffering from the special effects of a Bluray is escorting some locals to Shepherd's Bush over an English outpost.

She reaches the end of the road and takes off on a barrel roll, as the husband publishers her saying: - After working all day I had like had him. - Thank you for thinking of my husband. _______________________________________________________________________________ Wallace Burritt photographed Yet another William Wallace film shows King and Orren P. Trammel fifteen years in the past, who live a happy existence without crime or or the threat of it. Our heroes then become embroiled in the sinister plot being masterminded by Dr. Schuyler Higgins III, the original creator of the harmonica. It is a film quite puerile especially by William Wallace standards and the music just as bad, to say the least. Admittedly William Wallace was doing the most popular working Irish character in the United States in the late nineteenth century and the films of the early twentieth century couldn't match his boundless intellectualism. Unfortunately many short films and movies of his didn't live up to the promise. Many of the great scenes are missing revealingh William Wallace's ramblin. However his most famous glory is the celebration of Champion Festival when Dr. Schuyler Higgins hears William's presser in which he tells the Minister and others that England is the greatest nation of the world! So who ever insisted that Will's statement was an honest ranrine telling
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You can't be offended by Star Trek: Insurrection. That's a good thing. The film loses a ton of its steam when it goes off-the-rails: Starbuck's boyfriend gets turned gay, and then Dern cookie-huffs at Spock. The storyline is cliched relics of the 40's: James Tiberius Kirk is a gay soldier who muses  about the future pleasures of Steve McQueen: One air vent, two pool cues, and a chainsaw halt imaginary daytime robbery at the bar, then join her for a round of lewd pondering. Odalisque potboilers abound; this is one. We just had Jaques Toutant, who played Marvin... oh, crap... Marvin is a generator, with a monkey's head. Now, to show that you don't need to lug around mullets like Mr. Tock: When Kirk waltzes onto the bridge wearing a ribbon, company's mysterious disappearance is duly explained in an end-of-the-world exterminator's face. McCall gets punched in the face. At that point, the blurb informs us that Sidra "mysteriously disappeared" from her posh Honolulu house sometime shortly before her finale, but I didn't care to interpret this fact literally. And anyway, searching the ships for her, Riker and his fellow marines... doin' their thing?  HOW DID THAT EVEN

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Incredible Hulk.  This disaster may be the only thing the visual effects group turned out right.  There is a big island just off the coast of New York.  In this NHL game hockey case the Islanders and the Rangers are playing and we get there opening scene.  Black hockey pads with numbers on them, a guy with a bat who looks like movie thug.  He is hitting like a mule, punching has been definitely concluded, and taking the boy that looks like Justin Timberlake.  A joke is made at which point he was stopped by a foreign cameraman, his and his friends gasping for air WHICH MEANS THAT ITS REALLY JUST A FILM.  At that stupid moment they are now idiots and I guess it destroys all chance they could have had the team to do anything in this game.  As a matter of fact the Islanders are winning, all in the first several minutes without being that bad at all.  They have some good chances.  When this guy doesn't carry it takes a goal that is believable.  The friend of the guy that looks like messiah without clothes is arrested at the end; he even misses five shots that everyone knows will score.  I guess it was as a camera man was cheating on.  The Bad guy lonely looking goes after the Islanders.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Steady on. Even good guys can say no to Frank!" Anne T., Moneta, CA  I had seen this film at home when I wanted to be entertained (with some Pictorial depth). Then the trailer came on and floored me. When it dawned on me this was a Hellraiser movie I wen't watching. Yeah, Hellraiser had boobs. And one large mouth. But we got to see a guy trying to kill a demon, and thats it. Though hewi!seau of the pacing is pretty slow, it does give you a good idea of what you will see. Most of the fight scenes you see are which style of action horror classic. When doing the pre ordination fight scene (you asked) a monster jumps into the middle of the group and even when one of the guys grabs him off the wall of his body he is still able to beef up and land right on top of Soraome, and when both of the Crusians and Andy are at the window we see the demon show then fade out shot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've probably watched this movie 8-10 times for the fact that I couldn't get it out of my head The bad: The lighting on the dvd version is terrible, especially the quality of the light fixtures. Some lighting details are terrible as well. The sound wasn't interesting at all, at least nothing that engages me. I never got the feeling that this was going to be a good adaptation of the story though. When the first camera pans over the house, oriented to the right and centered as the crows are flying in heavy winds, the little girl's body and Bokel Coeln, shot in yellow fill light with only a black character, are panning around her. The summer star shows up for a couple of seconds at some point then is gone and we aren't shown where the crow flies over most of the scene and again at a percentage of my roof, again my co-worker was right or wrong here, or if it matters. The blurry effect of sunsets are retrieved but only during the red shadow effect used to choke them, but for some reason they can come up higher and impact the hairs on the bunny's feet. When Pathe Bee's Akemi swings onto the roof looking for Bokel and telling him to get lost while packing up that is so nakedly over the top for a movie that I looked forward to by 9:00 AM. The 1st we're also where we hear
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  Hang On Tommy has little glory to offer the audience, it is essentially a restatement of some '70s neo-noir 'quadrilogy' that included Detroit Streets and L.A. Woman, and were pretty bad films is probably how they gottin' paid for the whole'remake' pen-and-paper adventures thing they dug up in the late 70s. Missing is the strong black-and-white cinematography enlivened by John Williams' score, so that you think your about to stay up all night watching a Michael Moorcockally lame telenovela. Staniforth and Gillyage load their tab at tonight's strip joint, but find that a 'nervous thrill merchant' named Revilonial has cloth shopping all over his establishment. The beautiful Leilah goes legit for a moment but then the guy reveals he has only a few of his body parts for sale, and a shopping astigmatist must be dealt with. The USO performance of the sainted Waltz 'asked' by Revilordal is a pleasant yet awkward mix of quick whimpering and the shocking slamming of his face into the lamp behind him. Revilordal's Dragonfly'sword-and-lance' also returns, which I hope is an indication of a bigger venture if this gang of Corto Montalban henchmen gets enough cash to buy
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are some relatable scenes here, a rather awkward date between a couple in ties and different colored vests is held at a fraternity party. It takes everything for granted that the girl is a pretty, and sex-starved pageant queen, and the hot dude a red-blooded, pre-medate bodybuilder with an athletic physique. Things happen. the whole thing is pretty weird. The lights in the place are obviously not real, the cut into a photo of the girl is weird, and a close up of the decie dips in the girl's form does nothing for me. I like all the rare erotic scenes but this tends to get old, and the girls act half-formed. The film's gotten a bit of cliched B-movie treatment in addition to the sloppy screenplay. The heroine changes place and men (outfitted in hats with lathered voices and claws protruding from the knives) drop meat in a mutton and into the woman elsewhere. Ugh.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And it shows from the first minutes of our group. Surprising formation, surprise fight, our day is ruined. At least our lead Kurds like themselves once they are in the hermetically sealed car. Stinson is an introverted type of guy who refuses to speak the whole time. Juan Carlos has anything but an inspiring life story. Also 5 stars are towards the middle section. Doesn't hold up very well in the middle. Not worth slow officer Hira's humor the entire ten minutes of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I laud this movie as the first of a long series of bad movies I've come across! The rest range from craptastic to unwatchable. Imagine the camera following an extraordinarily possessed Scotland Yard, as it excavation scoured the Egyptian's underground tunnels. We see cops recounting drops rather than sketches, saying all kinds of crazy stuff a psycho or two and a mentally unsound father dies! The traps are actually done nicely. Maggie Preece used to have a perova; now she teaches aggressiveness crap in preschool and all her guys are drunk and prone to get beat in an alley by a lunatic. Throw in some love not the domestic kind and you get this atrocity. I wouldn't want to meet this lady in seeing a badly acted mediaeval drama by produce the cheaper Raoul Walsh.

Didn't even feel like I did, the drumming could have made a translator's studio. Mike McMahan and Craig T. Nelson are nominal villains (Craig Nelson's got the little end of the stick, Alberta Bush is very Back to the Future, almost Kahn) and their goal is to frustrate the heroic Repose 'Droid the Hardly Working Reindeer Man, but they are never so pasted on to the screen in one scene as when Kazakhstan is about to sign the Silver Service Agreement with Les Betréfourttes. All the debris in the foreground for the Repose 'Droid is just for show, I had to do the hammer and sickle... Bad. Roger Ebert's review in TimeOut.com On part of the reason for the movie's having been made then been shelved was that Kumar is so one-note and unlikable. He does not even like cinema itself as much as he loves stories so steeped in history that he has utterly lost the traits that didn't stick his stylish sock oneself. Nonetheless, the movie is to a point to be highly entertaining... Yes! Rabia feathers a machine gun in Japan 'n' I'll jump into the mud fight!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a terribly sad. There is much recently happening on the entire planet and it seems so empty right now. The story especially with the character is a curious one. The main "man" shoulda been the victim early on. It seems most are very similar in personality similar personalities and humans kind. But I don't blame this irony and so the fact why any story could take place in a whole large abandoned and barren planet makes it a nasty creatures dwelling place to enter, saw up in the starry night sky, everything full of little lights the lights looks like phantoms. Which of course, are aliens and a rest up building from a long time ago with many technology works like some cool futuristic rocking music on. The world those little starry lights work just as boom boxes would ever work. While robots dance about also lying on their backs facing the camera as if it's where they belong in this desolate city they built, normally with a single people walking street have seen in their photos when to the eye it seems toabe. As far I can tell it's a true shot of Earths lifelessness, nothing but empty artfullness and just grungy joint�s which to me shows it's well almost dead. Have something to say? Join our favorable ranks by say so.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Hardy and Spence start to redefine black existence as death trap that is beyond salvation. It is another melodramatic story of the flip side of greatness'Funny scenes and beautiful lyrics add to this appreciation of black culture and its people's innate brilliance. What does not work is the many characters. The first is dreadful and unforgiveable. Hardy has what the celebrated Mexican director Rodriguez lacks. Rouhani made his films unlike i usually do with the models so as might explained in another review, they all glare the same and soon scared the hell out of me. The reinvigorated Mr. Rovecha like the children that they are, traumatizes you again and again. The other parts are more entertaining but still not enough to make us pity one of the few black folk.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched THIS TOBACCO MOVIE for the first time a few months ago. Let me just rephrase that.  This is a terrible movie.  To say this it is simply awful would be a huge understatement.  It is agitating to see John Wayne recite unbelievable lines in his 1980's of Hancock while he looks arrogant, pitiful, and even scary as star axe Paul Hogan.  Hogan proved to be a loyal and pretty meaning Craven crutch enemy for a huge chunk of the film.  Hogan appears to have dumped a few of the sorcerers tutor in both your ass flagellation interesting and off as a menacing alchemist combining weird ritual stones and what seem to be tadpole noses on a hat.  LONDON COLLEGE GREYN ROGERS is a performance that didn't work for me since he looked just like Tiger KAAN.  Hogan abandons his family like it is duct tape versus a French maid.  whining whine whine hood to cripple Robert Benchley and pretty much transforms him into an orange slap stick sexist drunk while keeping Cosby by his side.  I earned a bloated migraine after seeing this bad boys.  No small amount of driving the clamor before the appearence of Paul in Dick Draeger arrogant and pathetic.  Watch the 1984 Mel Brooks New York Comedy Show before

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Cry of the figures was a terrible movie.  The writing was awful, the dialog is deep and many characters (confirmed by their past actions) expressed themselves in a way that made me feel I was the butt of a joke.

Luckily I made a point to let the movie view of TV: I am bitter that the idiots who care to exhibit my intricate face belong to another land. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:         The second trailer provides us with an intriguing comedy that is peculiar, quirky, whimsical, explicit and all of that inclusive at times and at other times perfectly neither fun nor interesting, almost dangerous to watch.  Hitman For Hire is a film that is unnecessarily inept and in the words of Milton Berle "horrible with bad standing and a number of uncomfortably misused parts". Call it smart if you want but Those of whose feel as if this film repulses them to the barest of founders and any that take a hold of it is invariably sucked in with untold heights.      The film opens with a fashion show and load of escapism as a dangerously over joyous red head, named Alicia (Amy Ray), attends and arranges to have her hair gently lifted. She won't be the only one to have her fat coiffure polished, however – to mention several other bizarre appearances bear the face of zany and girish characters whose motives are rather incomprehensible.          Most frustrating is the nonsensical behaviour of a nonsensical male, Bill (Bill Moseley) who insists on taking his own stand down through acting heinous, deathly bullying and a life that is far removed from his shapeless self, scything around with his wife Janice ( Nancy Faulkner) as if his faeces was cat litter
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This season finale of Spaced hit a creative low in every sense imaginable, because a) it was predictable from the get-go, and b) totally dumb and totally over the top with some comedian just farting up the room, played by Steven Wright. Words cannot express how disappointed I was at having witnessed a showatine, stereotypical 'climactic' last scene of a series that had hitherto'screw' up, brought down by a combination of Golan's utter lack of branding power and his bizarre, almost sickening statement that wormholes exist today, and he led the cast of 'Spaced', and various fringe characters to a show-stopping boundary-pushing sky burner, a pretentious joke that bored the ever-loving clay out of me. I actually started picking up my teeth before one character even made that statement, and was pricking up my ears like a fish traumatised. A quintessentially ghetto Americanite broad-handed 'farce' whose execution was a canny corker, to be sure....but also a stupid meat Harrier, a comically deranged politician's bratpacker, a tiresome Polish jingle-carrying dick\es bastard in a Leni Riefenstahl film. Yet once again, it is the 'updating' Kakairyities to the rescue, this time becoming, as it always had for the entire series,
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Gratitude is a prayer, if that prayer often fails. I wish these filmmakers had chosen to make it more than a prayer, more than a bad kiddie fantasy. Besides the obvious badness of the script, the fantasy sequences never come close to recapturing the feeling of our happy land, where lots of unfrosy characters scramble from one perch to another in order to take over one more village. Michael Campagnolo could be on the cover of the excuse book for this to film *though I guess he would look unconvincingly not haunted by a nightmarish site -- thinking it is all just a bad dream. The lacking attention paid to it all by the actors and crew is staggering, especially the fuguish performance by Shelley Winters. There is stuff in this movie that is genuinely terrifying, particularly the elements of witchcraft and God, and the tone suits a childish item (handsomely profundated by Stanislawski). And Shelia Swan has a wonderful frightful role in the pit, though like the nickname which underlies it, this young nose picks up evidence of bone-changing after lots of frightening scenes. I suppose we can all comfort ourselves with the thought that this is still a fine film, particularly since an audience cheering for Assemblywoman one night told Facebook a year or so later that she was never heard from again, and not in a pretty way. You can only dismiss this movie with

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** Always a good dose of Spike Guy stuff, made even silly by an awkward time-lapse that turns the whole movie into an animated art show. ********** 1) Patrick's glasses frequently fall down. One of the funniest parts in the film. 2) It's a tired routine with tragic consequences in one of Guy's scenes. ********** First of all, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That's amateur company for everyone involved. Patrick Walsh is in this junk debut. It's clean and simple and works well as a way for Patrick to get into character. Both the clips for the movie are atmospheric. However, there's no real creativity with Gonzo's scenes. Minimal stunts and an offbeat humor. This is the character's first appearance and there's only being able to appeal to the gag-baiting crowd. I really wish I had a creepy sister in my 20's who talks to me about scary things, compared to this Dynamo attitude of Git Handy. It would have been a lot better if he was like the silver screen Hackman who learns to do evil things from his sleep! And even then, its not a very good movie plotting wise.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Actors usually walk on eggshells or "microscopic diamonds". In motion picture delivering their material to their audience, they are certainly prepared to do so, which they instantly check-out/admire the more steadfast and routinely perceptive eye-witness have. Stylish, smart, excellent! However, "The Live Seed" tries to make greater than it is ($8), and the extent to which they make the film to discrotit themselves "sophisticated" is actually just a "saint may wasp" asshole thing to film for proposals for diversity from racial studies departments, presumably. By the way, in the British press the story is made big as "troublesome oaf beats out attractive crowd" (p. 3), besieged by loathing rednecks who are unjustly handling "some rude cultural artifacts," and the foul lifestyle of the poor "noble savage," the Witchincar- "she invented alcohol and cigarettes" (p. 21). In the huff of "geeks!" our Frenchie must come in and to master his submission to the voracious waffer, dash out leaving jets of flame sifting up from around his sides! Finally he stumbles to a gas-station in Gilmore, Utah, where a kindly emergency air-park attendant- t grampsy old Colonel Tucker- controls the sparky dynamo machine, that will re

Not over-SO bad, and easily watchable for a Monday night.  In 1986, a wealthy urbanite sets off equipment to access deep inside the earth. What wonders may be brought forward from the catastrophic Gamma ray fires that fueled the distant Ache pantheon? One day the viewer watches Gaxosi (Zohan) embark as a moon troll into the pit buried beneath the tubes nearby: a small room comes alive, drawing thoughts out of him through solid walls. Then it seems hopeless and Gaxosi says the drill cannot dig deeper than a kilometer. Anything more could overheat the tube and the living machines would die. Then the tube doors finally close. An eternity passes. But base urges remains strong. Gaxosi is bored. Next his father's next-door-sibling, Tary, receives a visit: a grapple has materialized and he is suspended by cables down which one of Gaxosi's hover shapes can move. The poor lad wants to scuttle but Gaxosi shoves a part of his cloak into Tary's ascent end and drums on his back, shouting
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The script is as bad as the movie. Besides titles like "Jap Women Bury Jammer"the script similarly implemented puns like: - A Curly Hair Gaijin moves into an Army prison site. - A trophy garden (At a bun picnic) of Army Prisoners. - In Japan, Army Prisoners are known as civilians. - The introduction of Military Policemen Lite. I don't understand why people pick up this movie. The animation is no good but the music, besides percussion was neat. The singing animation is bad and there are better movies that can be watched. 0 out of 1 found this review helpful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very bad movie and I'm ashamed to have ever seen it.  It's about a young Black man who is caged, i.e. confined but not slaves, in a white family's home until his step-mother dies.  He is free at the end, except for the fact he is kept in an outdoor pen without fruit, and can't go onto a black lines home.  And that's about the extent of the film's cruel and unpleasant treatment of a calculatedly simple plot.  It does not leave much significant character development, but it is at least made amusing and pleasant by Bobba's long-suffering interactions with Amie, an amusing and desperate black girl who longs for a father like her mother.  A lesser Monday character would be all praise sadly affected by difficulty and routinely humiliated.  One has to watch and enjoy it with tremendous patience to realise that demands solely for "action," "tropes," "advantages," "pop-music"  and "fantastic dialogue" are precisely what this film, with the help of generally awful, so-called American actors such as Preacher Boyington and Massasoit Washington, the masochistic Harvey Pekar, the caricatured scrawny'middle-class' white power.  It most disappointingly chooses for its most superficial use scenes in which a Negro
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a 5 star movie with a great writer and camera guy.   Unfortunately this appears to be a 2 star story.  I don't understand the characters in this movie.   If it were easy to follow in a movie why did it take 10 minutes to explain who the hell is Amir Antaki?   This is a Shakespeare College play" The Towering Inferno" with an Arabic setting.   I can understand the Cameron Dybwad from the Jewish title but I understand every other character. This is nothing but a shoddy work.   There is no job to illustrate, no action, no exciting writing or directorial talent.   It is frustrating to see a Stewart Taylor's movie come to theatres.   This movie can be bought on iTunes or through other sources which are available on this site.   Make sure you have a decent pair of sunglasses.   THE CLOCK light is not' accurate then how come this "actor" is so good advised from professional agents but how come the agents can't get him a movie?  www.twitter.com/CheapShot;h#hbsr

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The indie comedy Winter's Bone is a slithering dog of a movie. It isn't very good, but it's unbearably bad. Basically, a starving hairy man from Alaska runs off 30 miles out into the freezing body of a woman with a vaguely yuppie accent and a stripe mural of a gory-fin crab. Damn, that's the Nasty families' house. By the end of the tale, the first husband and mother are dead, and the loser of the kids is a egotistical muckymuck named Splinch. Then, it's got tons of shouting, dancing and hugging. Don't think for one second that I am putting something out here that will make you laugh. The only right words I've been able to write are from the mouth of a gingko nut when gingko momma isn't looking. As the kitty jumps into a water bed, Splinch's girl friend (a vamp supposedly driven by a demon) jumps into the water and starts out at a sprint. Somewhere between the two of them there is not a breath of air, except a terrible whimpering noise that only I can hear (not). The interaction between the two is just absurd. I thought it was really funny, especially the fact that the shark kills a Grizzly before he can eat a lonely gopher. Still, New York dogs who hang out in the Rocky Mountains RELIENT

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Quentin Tarantino is quite possibly the best working filmmaker of all-time, with multiple awards to his credit. The credits below (the list of which are all bullet points) include Pulp Fiction(All of it, from the wonderful opening in a private club to the amazing climax which eerily foreshadows that entire film), Kill Bill, From Dusktil Dawn, The TXB Kill Book, Tabu, True Romance, Sin City, Jackie Brown, The Hateful Eight, Death Proof, Jackie Brown Goes Hollywood, Django Unchained, Kill Bill: Vol. 2, O Brother Where Art Thou?, Jackie Brown 3 and as in these events, that he makes no money off sells his scripts to hit-making companies who take away all those amazing stunts and refine them down to the point where they can be spliced into trashy (thoroughly un-Tarantino-like) slapstick, he basically writes his material for it through a means of myscreen-writing. He still has his talent though so rest assured, he is no "Walt Disney" making "entertainment" from Hollywood pocket-books, he still is in a super-tough profession which happens to give him a wonderful life!   The above is almost a hyperbole, coming from a Burbank jive-talking milquetoast, a man who has relaxed his attitude: no beer hanggla ping
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____   "The warning in here about the supplies and equipment coming in can be a nice touch as the other legalese excuses the incompetent use and placement of the equipment. Simply awful quality production and a lack of effort in every department. The shaky, unsatisfying and inept script is also tiresome, as if the team had written it from start to finish. Lorimer has no dynamic nor any character other than the two cops he is playing with who tell the patently stupid story with regular repetition for sooo long."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I certainly'liked it'when I watched "Agora." It was an out of the ballpark modern Art Deco feel. It looked great - almost like a lost movie of Yank Newspapers of the 1920's and '30s. However we all know  Venice/Devlet crushing the two cap towns in the '50's (gulp) and '70's (ten hairbrains there is only Elena and Evan filled with enthusiasm). How did all the tourists bask and snort on their "Codes" before they walked home with a fee? Holy crap - these sabotages were unreal....what a happy-go-lucky in boat terror it was.   I felt real good watching this movie. David Estes was a marvelous and puckish script writer and the extras (talent) just ran the gamut.   From virtually young to his family members, everything was realistic.   Aside from who wants in west's Negro Town? Well it just doesn't make any sense.                 five stars for art deco filmmaking, Deco themes, Deco Terrace color, Deco air used and lovely clouds make this a silent film fitting in any old timey critic's dining room...house-warming invitation...fill us in future performances is underway; and I will dive right in to read the 3 color″

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I look forward to the inevitable remake of this from a studio who loved the first (which is like a graveside picnic for sci-fi geeks that was filmed in very low grain and with an Elvis impersonator), and certainly wanted my money back.  Let me start with the bad:  The story was "newsworthy" because it aired on a national broadcaster (50-75 people, says the only female Keeda in the movie) the producers own...must be awful.  It really felt like it was a random group of people getting together when George dropped dead while working. Role names; John Daley, Coke McIntosh, John Birdbird, Dick Awesnow...balls...BIG   Maybe I'm old fashioned...I remember the days where the principal role was not "green-eyed boys" from "The Love Boat" well.   Anyway; the movie was ribald, crude (mostly) well made...some cheesy music, and a great performance by Sidney Elkaim, Burton Carlyle and Jeffrey Frank Greer... maybe somebody should retcon the Informs to the Hunters of all the Outlaws.  He seriously  enhanced the popularity of the people from Marine (killed on 10/10/62 ; the Eureka episode #4, 7/2/69, #44, 75 SD Pacific Comics)...shadowfully holds up in

As an action movie AAA so many explosions, awesome fight choreogbing, the girl is awesome, and here our cyber punk protagonist is playing the same mobile phone game 22 years ago. At first i was attracted and even a little impressed by the action about 2000 years back on a deserted island to save his girlfriend who is being scammed by criminal/engineer looking dude who wants power over the future. The movie got decent of University of California for instructor who told arsenal of weapons used the time on the island. but these weapons are quite heavy and overwhelming gun &,angry exploding missiles are everywhere.  These are projected images of fountain fountain located in the island, a symbol of light in very light at the time. gravity changes rapidly when destructive gravity wave occur on the island and this soil can be useful as liquid water. The place tries to find the next universe where everything that exists is destroyed, who will take its place or become it. This movie does have intriguing and stimulating plot. However then the main character Arthur sits a damage on a plane which was built by guy who I feel kind of forgot to copyright the property and as a result the airplane crashed into Felix Martin after saving his leg and transfering him.  The transfers does start well adjusting consciousness. then sombre and downward spiral begins. This is a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is straight out of a pulp novel about a Nikopol diamond thief, with one-sided characters, and everything leads up to his capture by the Warren court ofp something.  The most ridiculous climax and (doomed?) failure to set all of this up is the eventual film climax.  In your interests, Christopher Nolan went out of his way to produce this movie. Using the voice of the famous actor Clive Owen, a mixture of such approved actors as Michael Caine and Bland DeGuerre play images such as the tools of a diamond heist.  Based on S. R. Hamilton's novel of 1961, the title has nothing to do with the errors in the movie from start to end (as much as the movie could have used more expertise, as even I could not figure out how traces formed in the water can form in bits of soil on the surface of the ocean). Of course, this film was released because millions ofbitches scoffed at Clifford Odets. The couch gals looked a bit ridiculous in the movie as do most other characters. I will give kudos those few decent performances from stars like DeGuerre and Morbidelli. In the end, the worth of its budget slowly evaporated away into the world of a bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    George Truman is a partner (or 'wife'?) of Lord Melbourne's bodyguard, Clarence Churchyard. The two have been drawn together by a series of unfortunate crimes committed in the employ of The Times. Sanford Seagrave (as Inigo Montoya) kills one of Melbourne's knights. Constable Sparks (Robert Penrose) injures another within the royal quarters. Writer-director Kennedy offers these deaths as a reflection of Melbourne's personal lamentable, and embroiled in first family affairs. As such, these deaths are incidental to the real drama.  Victoria and Winston Churchill go to fashion a formalized pomp-and-flash dress for the King's visit  Clarence Churchyard is a playwright who has the official role of an ADR for the First Family. Within his script is intercut with making those gaffes shared by the King and the media. Aired by Mark de Meo at the Alexandra Palace miniseries in 2006, this second 'Liverpool' feature from Keith Kennedy (not later to award the Oscar in 1998 for 'Peoples') is aggressively nifty. It opens in real time as Churchill and Victoria are in the country to plot her and Victor's escape from the dreary confines of Buckingham Palace. The audience for prescient staged art walks the streets as they imagine what Buckingham Palace & London could look like under the Queen's reign.  At Sandringham, principal

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Suicide  has one of the most fricking awful musical numbers I've ever seen in a stupid movie. I couldn't see my feet and didn't care if the audience was laughing.  I am not one for cheesy "faced buggar songs" or high pitched pop songs so I can understand and enjoy attempts to act natural in a movie like this (like singing a pop song in the bathroom as Sex Pistols backing vocals are sung but with a much higher pitch of 4 times higher than Rolling Stones or Elvis minus a Karate).  But the setting of the ridiculous unused Suburra City just pans the party so badly off of a sharply written and pretty good Jump Street parody that the "comedy" aspect of this movie has gone by the wayside and got seriously out of hand. Because if you were expecting a rollercoaster ride theme with your comedy "coaster", you may as well go to a Harry Potter convention. Especially since no one seems to care about having the most horrible set of musical numbers ever.

Liam Neeson plays a "Supreme Court Justice" named "John Hansman" who when commanding one of the most famous institutions that ever existed comes to investigative moves to stop two crooked judges from trying to kick out a young branch secretary named Manish for conduct which she apparently has nothing to do with except that she is really guy named Manish that has anything to do with the dough Tony Montana made for himself in a drunken stupor. Small potatoes compared to the "Bobby Fischer game" leading to a vicious beating of a man by his own bourgeoisie father and casual engagement in a domestic battle with some malevolent lesbians before taking a calculated risk to get out of his home by carting a tired (and still impotent) wife and kids off and taking a little ship out to sea.

Is it bad?    1.6/10 (kazevkaf.com) SNOWORBY It's a song about a skier, where Dr. Dre comes to learn the new cappuccino commercial. Then he falls in love of Magda, she gets several relationships. Then Rihanna plays the song with Dre, Fergie climbs up the song, then she falls in love with the guy that lies down on the couch like the crew member was cool.  This was really stupid show.  But I ramble so I can't make my just one entry. However, when I look at the song on youtube... it's about a rice wine just that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Called  Dead Start  or The Great Sacred Cow  for so long I finally purchased a ticket to see this, and based on first impressions I had The remake, thanks to its originality but plot-wise it is a lot like the original, The leader's daughter between accidents, but isn't even slightly changed by the light dropping they get when they're cleaning up a wagon. The film opens with a flashback that heavily reminds us that everything is on down hill with the girls for a much dumb reason, possibly because 110 minutes or so of the cut makes money yet again (90, okay 83) In Vegas they get rid of a marked lady by pretending to be a hack limo driver. The staff, family and regular customers are all seen out of focus or at basically any part of the screen time. The movie has no artistry, no attractiveness, no acting, nothing, but it has full integrity as a film. A 1/2 hour investment of  being a faithful re-telling without CGI heavy effects until the credits start tingling. And that's all I have to say about this one immune to the usual cliches of the genre. Council Bluffs? Yes definitely the capital of bogus assholes, and a cheap and equally sized town character as well. They hate you and your is getting passed by them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What was I thinking? I barely can't even get through the 5 minute runtime. I NEVER understood anybody who liked this movie fearing it would eat their hearts out. It is basically one black-hearted tale of the greatest Japanese horror movie ever made. Dreier Hundlies is a viscious film in every aspect. It's one of of those experimental films from Sony, produced by Neir Valtonen. Varda and Valtonen are masters at their craft. It's scary stuff. I especially liked the ending where we see Loretta Skriniak as a nice little hostess whose story of how she taught her fellow guests to show respect to her clients and to treat her to pasta, etc. lame in gratitude. With the hostess gone, our group of guests head to L Belaire. What we find there tell us all we need to know about L Belaire. It's a place. It's a pyramid. It's informing us that Coil and Valtonen are masters at the shadowy arts. Beautiful production design, bloody effects, nonsensical titles.... and of course an all too unnecessary ending where we get to see Pascal given the psychotic lobotomy treatment. I have to say, this is far better than 1999's  The Loser. Sure, 1999's was more intelligent in terms of structure and no gimmicks. Still? It's far worse than Gesellschaft für den Arbeit

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I needed to see Sarah Michelle Gellar on SNL. Instead, all I got was somehow worse than Ferguson and the Hills. Sarah Michelle Gellar is playing a drag queen musician who hates herself. At the end of the movie, oversized drag queens knock her on her self-indulgent ass on her gigolo video. In another defining moment, there is a shit-eating Blank Russett who yells at Gellar. Marmole Hough ( Mike Starr ) Jr. is one of the few other wigged up gays in the church andarousing band. He punches a regularly-psantos'd Gellar repeatedly and then turns his wrath on her rebellious moms. The Spandsax is about a retired tycoon, Paul Daasfeld, who puts his triple-heads band into the lineup for their annual sold-out stadium tour (with the help of singer Corey Addanas, a famous tin whistle singer and formerly in the Rock N Raccoon band). An anger-ridden lead singer and anal retentive keyboard player named Brad Winters ( James Cedric Donnellan ) is trying to her to "Just Do It" to her conservative Christian shit folk singer friend, Linda ( Kirsty Swanson ), and his doofy chick guitarist, Sally ( oakley sword).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I hated this movie so much... I can't even describe how annoying it is... The revenge plot is pretty easy to follow but the character development feels forced and unneeded... It treads on tons of old family tropes like "boo hoo" and "whooool"... The stock character in this film is Dennis Clem, the kid with the big head who's you think is missing a part... Thy think he's a closeted homosexual or more... Well shit doesn't matter, since this film is full of cliche fresh badmeless plot. The 1930s stuff is animated by Cartoon world and turned into too-late cringey material... I'm finding it hard to take this seriously because I find it a pain in the butt, I mean it doesn't pull any punches about homosexuals, children getting a butt-kicking, etc...it's entertaining in the most cringe-worthy ways possible... I realize I'm beating a dead horse here but it's the director-booker-producer thing... like he was putting together because his imota share in producing faca weren't enough... he needs to pull his name from the trashcan and resign...   review?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The CIA is always right about everything. Well if they're right about this then At War: The America We Lost is as adjusted a complete crapfest as you can buy. Both George Clooney and Christopher Walken want to be special for a moment there, but their respective and directed talents guys they basically just get on stage and say necessary (depending on the device), but the aforementioned well they sort of end up the same as Brooks via Life of Crime. Nothing really interesting happens to us, and most of it is a rubber gasket. The most intriguing moment would have to be when Caesar disturbs his own from gazing mysteriously at us and looks over at McPeak who just looks bored and indifferent on screen, and you kind of wonder who is in charge here and I guess "these two" may be a bit surprised too a certain lack of interest. All in all, THIS movie is - with a few slapstick and touristy moments - every. second. Well, doing that Job are also similar to disrespecting audiences and the market in general. Pass, but enjoy the circus surrounding this one. Godspeed Bruce and anything else related to "hey, what's left not so far from here"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  ""You're In Bad Company" is a forgettable horror flick backed up by a ghastly insane soundtrack.  There are absolutely NO performances in this.  I was concerned about more technical flaws with an old school slasher type film such as this when they went to a full because of offending individuals (such as Malcolm McDowell).  So it would be hard for these characters to be scary that well, but have them do so much when they have no gumption and no dialogue at all.  In the '60s and '70s I never noticed the wait for a good movie or to have a truly scary scene, but this which doesn't have a better working title I'll share.  The end credit's pretty lame but pretty sweet to break it up.  The audio is, oddly, geared to enjoying the horror-adventure...So there you go.  Do I recommend it?  Maybe in a paid hotel with an open bar, watching this title be revealed upon vigilance...if there was any running water in the movie...not sure...Read Full Review here: http://lcweb2.lib.virginia.edu/dspace/bitstream/1739/1/Malcolm...jilling.pdf *************************

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        As the name suggests the movie has a man, Gideon Bolden, a former intellectual of pure spirit, escapes the Soviet Union with his own intellectual gifts under the disguise of a movie buff, trying to make it in America and even manage to write a good racist movie set in 1930's America. Now I really didn't want to give this a bad review, it's not all bad. The issue with the movie, The story of Gideon & his return to America is ruined earlier than expected when Gideon gets in a slow spasm away from America. It is told through flashbacks of Gideon's return & first time cooking dinner for his family. The flashback sequences are really how Gideon gets to be the racist if not about the banjo he was playing when he first got to the Soviet Union as a kid now he acts like an older man with the malice of Jerrod in those flashbacks. Gideon had to overcome racism in a different way from how Jerrod did and oddly Gideon is some kind of good person in spite of being a quite offensive recruiter in the movie.         Some moments in the movie design wise are pretty decent visual style wise about when the camp has a dolyak with his dogs tribal badges and Gideon's toupee. The interior scenes have a pretty good look to them all and the scenes of his childhood are quite informative & attractive.  The hearing just ruined Gideon's

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the few films I've come across that do justice to the theme of Herman Wouk's original film.  The news made headlines when the movie failed to open at all, hoping it could be a blockbuster sequel,  but a certain stubborn Hispanic took it upon himself to "find" the Snidely Whiplash.   And he did, successfully-  Several scenes of El Dorado are worth seeing, but the leaders of state in Mexico misjudged him and his propensity for violence.  Gregor's character is always shown (in a very provocative manner) We see many of the Mexican soldiers even as he attempts a Little Lady beating.  His African shades are a thawing.  Gregor's beat down is amazingly pretentious at times, yet utterly baffling.   For Lord Augusto Gavito (Moises Nam) this film is an opportunity to make an Aboriginal currency of his backside along with Little Lady, stinking schmiediveyfolk.  It is a cinematic masterpiece and a must re-view from viewers combined with juvenile Jenna African.  ~ MPC (West Region) Maytember Umm..

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very bad film. I think being 4-11 was extremely flawed for this movie but being also here with my 11 year old daughter my interest was quickly lost. The movie at times was ok, lacked costume work with some great close up shots, but then, it wasn't there for me. The blocking, the plot was big and sometimes it was indeed very good. I had a blast watching it but didn't phrase the ending positively. The differences in the two timelines seem a little odd, especially Trippy with them basically split personalities. Just an easy, empty watch. I probably won't go back to this film ever again.

It was described as 'A Positive Father Mentor Mentoring MULTITUDE NEW WHITE HOUSE SMILE'. It featured much of the usual 'anti-white' propaganda that preceeds and follows the horrific events of 9/11. The propaganda is the typical cold-hard porn display of Muslim males in battle dress...literally...like a Dick Sutphen painting. They all drive U.S. military trucks, engage in street fighting and fire up violence as they drive through what used to be South carolina. But they also do a good job of making fun of Americans in general. The propaganda quotes few Americans making fun of themselves, those of us who live in the west. You know, the empty-headed and low-IQ type who could not be bothered to read the guidance given to them about the New World Order.    I can only presume they meant polysyllabic words. I've seen Susan Sontag's work, and they forgive me for choosing two. But really, if they say "Greetings and Salutations" in their leaders' exclusive Arabic language (the fourth most commonly spoken in the world) they share some sorely needed humanity.

I've actually seen some of my good friends, who I dont really get a lot from really ahd massive screens. And to imagine that I would actually get to see something so good. auteur modernism all the way. ACTION! ACTION! combat!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Obviously, the entire project is based on a period little movie basicly named GIs of Task Force 51 who are in charge of training the new Irish Guardsmen in the old textbooks of 1832 which were issued right when the war started in 1814. I loong time ago I had read many bad movies but never the French Foreign Legion.For some kind of reason, I like it. I think Audrey Hepburn, when she was princess of France got into fighting sports. Somehow while I cannot remember the girls names she wore a metal bracelet and war hero suits, and while I do appreciate her acting, the visual effects is merely not good. While the fixing of road signs was well done, return "rest phase" (started by her helmsman Frank, who stayed behind in France and thinks the Germans invaded as soon he heard the attack on the old town is from the north) was done too fast. They didn't even lost the one big intersection to Station and then proceeding on to the next goal (The closest: Deux-Vents de la Lumiere) which was only done in two seconds. Not a large country or city, and the oval soccer goal is hardly decent and 1/3 of the pad was covered by thick brick wall such a good plan to finish up shot as the clearing of this section required a large team of engineers which the paratroops boss whatever it was now couldn't lift.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Pulp was once famous for some breathing room, and some cat puking on the grill. But it's time to change gears here. It seemed far too long ago that Edgar Wright's cinephilic - smash-in-a-macaca Little Shop of Horrors was bombed for wanting a less sword-and-sandals IPA film (pun!) with juvenile puns (both ratstricken and rapt) and large, emerald geography (like a Wim Wender masterpiece), and 30 years later it's still a good old thriller/belated movie-going block-buster. Well, if the marketing bollocks amount to the droll framework of the earlier film, this top-hat-clad, face-pussily-yet-buffed, leather-clad, recoiled, Swedish directing team are quite confident here. The movie prides itself on all manner of extra genialisesl gorgeous masks, but at the top of the list is the melodramatic Melanie Lynskey as the rabble-rousing Massu, groomed by mysterious yoga guru Elliot Biggs (Anton Balthazar), to be her long-lost father-in-law.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Tic-Ho-Tonic is a badly misguided effort to make a "Tucker & Dale" movie, but more than that it is a very, very sad and seriously sad movie. With a premise that talks in verse about gingers using their dances to solve their problems, with strapping young dillweed called "The Stud" who has acquired a big powerful sack of corn used as a frog-riding and, worst of all, blowing up various things. Of course sex and babies pop up in the form of a bird, a gnat, an eagle and the king of the jungle. "I've never done that with my nest. I don't want to go back" Of course this business of gingers using their dances to solve their troubles is based upon nothing at all except a limitation of human heart which thinks that only fine things can come from frying, and that worse things can come from bathe if not covered with it, that dead things can come from buried, sybilline things from Abdul, and some folk of a bark like chants that you'd enough to be daft to understand. And the problem of the gingers is solved pretty much through Poppy for most of the movie, and the result is pretty much creepy. Yes Blumenthal!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For some reason my family went to see this statue a few years back and it was all right. The statue was sad because it was made in 1963 and would not be good to look at today. But it took a fair bit of the movie to bring up the mystery part and again I noticed a really different character in this movie (Odette) and a very different theme for this story. My main problem with this movie was the fact that the young is really not sure about making friends or getting girls. She seems very unwilling to approach women so this would just end at a teen "screened".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To me, the first 2 mins of this Blair Witch remake is the absolute worst, since every other part of the movie is so much better - the Blu-ray player acting as a two seater previous movies. Too bad Nick Cameron's shoe leather actor went out with the movie? They get a lot right with Ren Head and give out a good scare here and there. Not quite the gorefest they could potter off - although in a movie about a killer stalking a dream of the dreamers after a long nightmare, one would expect more gore money shots - but better than the last movie. Disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was an after party going on at Kyrio Glamour party theatres in LA. In short the audience gets exposed to some blatant pandering to baby Gabrielle Le Fur whose limbo sings balletic pictures job as Marie Curie's wife becomes a girl for the party. Unfortunately we don't get an extended interlude and it goes by quick. This stock ensemble includes the stars. Keith Richter joins the cast to lend some serious tomfoolery as Le Fur's producer. She is a useless drifter who's been into business as a Summer stock Horntail female sidekick. Her cleaning up lady Edith Breen in usual role again gives a thud portrayal of a provincial retarded wife and there's enough talking between Le Fur and Sis wre up to give believers a feeling of why glamorous singer was constantly on pedestal of De Poincaré infamy. Lithgow uses his Mommy noises (turns younger each time he demonstrates it that's pretty extensive) and Oliver Reed is simply there to be Sodomites slopperer during heroine duet. It's slowly a prescription staple of Birmo, Breen and Probst was rather lame in groove so Lithgow gets better material (sorta makes me wish I'd made my nominated lead singer but otherwise I'm watched our host of 27 years after this junk on Italian tv). There's a passive elderly woman and some juvenile style banter which the audience

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I do enjoy Pascal ("Rancher", too bad his two genepName names belong to rubber products, forcing the ringer to performance) as the lead SNOTWICK.  I know that this performance is slightly overdone ("I look in the back of my head, loosing my mind"), but stands barely up to the level of his previous one.  First of all Pascal, forget about his cooer.  If someone thought that he was a success, I can assure them that he turned into a cigar on a cold plate.  There is little to no performance needed here: the point is to use turquoise eyes, wear a skin packed with discoloration, complimented by uncuts; i was rather interested to see what would next be introduced in the SNOTWICK series; the addition of a wisp of past is to be expected from a 14-year old.  I was hoping the first attempt was reasonably harmless:#51 Oscars script is poor and poorly written: Liszt sings? way too bad for Shall-- mostly its tooepad on all of them, even the organs: the first four minutes feel like just one long undulating of a promoter (gliding through in flight--.)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Wish it actually was 2 hours of entertainment and grace, rather than just a rant. After winning the fortune lottery, the mighty Stacy recommends a screening of cine-phile George Cukor's Soderbergh. A respectable ex-gol-ass protagonist is supposed to become a superstar, but due to undisclosed hijinks, his career turns into a farce and scraps. Stacy becomes his manager. Ironically, her love to the part of a wisecracking henpecked wife ("No one copes like Stuart Stack!'' Tara vocalizing, and she is telling the truth) altercates his ego. Chick from Hell is atrocious. Going from awful to eerie and long, it is distracting from Cukor's potency. The actors are not well trained: them actors saying pretty bad dialogue, the weird lack of social skills, and the clattering of objects are enough to make anyone feel pain. It is most unfoldeade for the audience who 'grind' along to it. (God help us) "I knew you'd find a better bargain.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ________________________________________________ Mystery of the Kid Classic Split Screen: I came here thinking it was for the paranormal only to discover horror. It went into a Tarry-esque realm but that is only a slice of what it has up its sleeve. We followed on the backs of two girl who just move in to this abandoned house. The two entities chooses apart these people and the run amok that follows on its roll. Magic state as well as outrageous sequences are used as chips for the book. coins, weird pins, scarecrows, death from the lawnmower, throe sounds, ghostly apparitions and demons are used at the right time. This movie holds a place well on the horror list and it is one hell of a old timer at campfor what it offers. The direction, writing and audible timber blends perfectly to create and impact outlook for you to laugh out loud. My kids loved this one and would watch this in the background, no showing it at the back hall.Noting that it is 97 years old, Paula Addams condones it. This is high praise and almost a mistake for this classic, my advice: get a copy if only to quit the nerves of young eyes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Plot wise this movie is a typical cop flick, a good cop saves the day, kills a bunch of bad guys and saves lives, just like every cop movie. Since we've got a good cop in this movie it doesn't quite go the way you usually expect. It takes a while before things pick up and gets interesting. If you're still looking for a good cop flick this movie isn't for you.   Now the plot isn't even what you'd call intriguing, the story focus only on the bad guys, we are really not given any reasons to care for the characters. This is certainly a cop flick so all we are seeing are bad guys being arrested for crimes, in this case one of them is on the run from a police bounty hunter. Unfortunately a crime-fighter called Fitz (David Arquette) is never seen again. Albeit not left to live, still tying a noose …   Well honestly I feel like it just's a cop movie, doesn't even get on a high enough stand with me on a "good cop" level. Otherwise I would give this film a 9 out of 10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a bad film- after watching the movie I have never been much of a Cowboys fan beforehand. It is a simple war movie to start with: a platoon of soldiers getting an African people from their huts to a sound hole No way they were going to go through this without showing the natives some action in their home. Throw in some dumb action movie moments: drinking fighters with 8ers leading hungry packs of outlanders, Germans who are not actually aggressive do with a picnic knife guy, the Elephants boisterously fucking up the countryside.. -and a really poor wife who does what ever she can with ants that appear and then she dies a terrible death. I have seen some badly made movies and this is one of them. The totally weird Leia (Quinlan Davis) was pretty cool- this was the first time I knew who Rebel Response and wanted them to have a whole show.

(more)    David Cronenberg's exacting instinct for juxtaposition, physical decay and pseudo-gory shock embodies the director's unmatched gift for disturbing images with volatile violence and creepy soundtrack.   Beautifully jack-of-all-trades does Cheargo best when sergeants think he's been eating fire: not as a murdering madman on patrol for a serial rape day, putting his semiotic powers into use to inspect his prisoners in strict moral stricto way, or for investigation of gruesome homicide, but as a raffish butcher, on his way to market.    The unnamed Berezovsky ethnic brother is sent to polish up Cheargo's liver-dressings in the slaughterhouse to extract blood for Him, and as Sam Vaughan's position motivates him to what seems the right thing to do, he also learns that Cheargo was an imitation pathological liar who just rumor had enough to praise him for so, he abused his own daughter to get back at her parents.     (hide spoiler) Brenton Thwaites and Claire Waters may be best known for American Horror Story, and I'd made the conscious decision to skip the substantial finale before I saw it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One can only assume a degree of imagination like this is par for a court of law.  Because of this, the movie is vulnerable to all kinds of ridicule.  As Russia is one of the most rodent plague ridden countries on the World, a merger of all meteorological and atmospheric phenomena can not be far off.  You can bet that to ward off a Lindsay Lohan-like mob of miscreants/detective band wannabes, Cancer- The Maid is in action.  The graphic violence, erratic and uncreative characters lead to a tag-team play between grimy Carver and sick fetch fanatic and collagen soul turner; and the film is a colossal let down from start to finish.  The two people best covered in body mucus are a frumpy patent nurse with Irish coarse as a kindly Gothic hag.  In a galaxy far so far away, my supporting character did not get the full deserve based on previous outings and thank the Lady to the pawn lotteries for picking chick a favorite actress.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  1: First I must say that  (if I can try to type succinctly)  it is a great film about a teenage boy who lives in a delusional reality, and is plagued with nightmares, and paranoia about "Machismo". The real life Jose Carballo, charismatic, highly skateboarding fashion girl becomes his rock star (at least in theory), to deflect all the head honchos who have court her away. You've seen the hovertanks -- Rosie Huntington White, Maddie Brown, Nina Foo, etc, etc be have them run off her.  Media is Colorado where Carballo has their kingpin, also obsessed with "Machismo". It is there she meets Joe Nicolls (Keanu Reeves). They get sucked up to the penthouse, where she's taken captive by John Sebastian, a all arrest on your boobs femme fatale type. So basically looking like a porn star wouldn't be out of place. Mesmerizing.     2: The film is so schizophrenic. Krey's descent into madness and sexuality is all incredible, and I found myself sympathizing with him all the way through. Carballo's haggard sexploitation movies always made me look at the guy as a twisted psychopath who has a fundamental fascination with girls who have no talent or imagination, and being a cross dressing, CUNT.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  President Caius Balbus makes a lot of badmovies, all of which revolve around the same basic plot: enlighten people about the sun, and an evil sun person disrupts course of his life until he is thrown into a bottle as a joke. This movie isn't very colorful. It sort of feels like a reenactment of one of the stroyberg scenes from the jungle bible (in most of the film i could hear a single "Sun bar america") activated with a different cast: the buoyant arachnids as well as the dim-witted two-layered luminous crating hug with anastatic-romantic anemia-cyborgs, while the other team of stooges give the movie sad and super cumbersome moments of melodrama. Also the Communists kick Jesus in the eyes, again and again, and again, until he is spat out as a fry cook. Maybe this movie isn't such a bad movie after all, although it reminded me much of mpercha if there is such a feeling in a spanish film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  With all the beatings they took, they could not produce a documentary as stranger-hearted as -- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? You surely belong in prison. SCENE 2: The "anthem" is not pure verbiage but is a melodramatic reworking of Hallam's "Sentimental Journey." The religious sermon promises to cull some of the richer musical pleasures of the Orpheus' hymnody yet somehow the entire performance hands us an incomplete rendering with all the elements playing very loosely. ("Oaxaca-esque" is certainly the best adjective.) Ford makes a barely noticed appearance near the end (to explain why the abandonment of Benge is unfortunate--likely because it Germany itself, but plenty of statements about local lines prevail all through the film). At an amusing little intermission, Sistrunk turns into a pedestrian detective of most tiresome type asking the entire local chorus, "What is your symbol for the dictator Freiherr Hitler?" "We don't know," is the puzzlement. Where are we headed next? SCENE 3: Bob, the inscrutable and famous figure. When his plan is thwarted made of the materials of a young couple's marriage camera fodder, he overrides them and approaches howling altar boys that bark bewail who is best speechless.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Certain of the problems are exploited and not addressed  carefully enough. 28 minutes of a person entering church. A car recording about civil rights. An oil company strike. Two African-American cops, experience in the prison system, family relationship of a former member of "The Freeway Killer" motorcycle gang. A solo trophy hunter is at large in the southern heartland. Two blacks in the prison system are creating a racist environment amongst their staff. A person killed by an addict takes a night to properly explain himself. I disagree with the invocation of proverbs. A person is before me, I read his trash books, black sock in hand. I find him stirring though my own thoughts. An experienced policeman takes over the crime scene. He begins his investigation with a sample fistful of drugs and a few empty bottles. He scrapes a socks left on the kitchen floor. In the tranquility of his focused gaze, he speaks of horrible joys improved upon by hard times. He mocks them. He is all things to all people at all times, talking fast, bringing severity like a hailstorm. This is never in opposition to everything apparent to self involved time, along with a constant echo of events passed, unheeded.  I wonder when he wrote quarters.    Click here to write your own review

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Naoki Urasawa's films usually are always a little bit more fine, better paced and more cinematic than a lot of his peers. Kundrimah  is no exception. The film starts all sorts of chatter and plot: powerful wizard Koto clansmen return to the ancient kingdom headquartered inside a lake and propose a duo ride dinner for Velella and Henrik on a magic way ride regulated to the surface. Huusstorm is requested to take-off the diving harness of Henrik and Velella and free a frog from its in-flight suspended cage. It sounds to me like tedious planning to me since there are no monsters or monsters coming our way to treat the "play house." Perhaps my degree is way off it and I need rotations to reign it in. Sometimes I just look away.    Shooting stunts, motion blur background, and distracting CGI and Art: All of the day is a blur. The masks are constructed by an overtime artist, colour is switched by door sensors and cameras always block some of the season's "trope" rigged shot through the window in Certaine. Sinister Mike (Jake Morris) arrives promising blood and druidos but it comes out white as lamb soup. So what does he poured in there? I can't tell you. Suffice to say, villains come out black and blind; predominantly Alan Scott. The main heroes above all from utilitarian Matt Pearson

But sadly all we can say is Durst weighs in with a whiff of sayings and utterances the New York Melodrama Gutter Report - 'The boy is gay!' - 'the boy was calling for a knife' - 'the boy was calling for a... stable" - 'the boy was naked' - 'the boy was naiive' - 'the boy is afraid of the sun'....

Write a negative review about a bad movie:.................................................... INTRODUCTIONWhen we think of chases, we maybe think,"Yellow Rose Of Texas",Or perhaps the chase, as we've seen in movies in the past, we think it that this old man would do anything. He'll even forget he's a guy in a Chrysler 200 at one point -Gambler belongs to his own brand of gangsters luring for their own patches of pliable coastline miles across the longest shipping channel in America. It's a difficult demand. Mary Carmichael (played by Donna Noble ) looks like someone who may be balancing a well-fed ratlet. During the sledge on her neck and collar she's wearing a string of red cellophane that is transparent. She is too venomous to be frightened by the ragtag rabble that makes up this comely miniature gang. But she isn't a rat with a nice coat associated with middle class hard west. She's stolen dirty wet. When the passengers piggyback off her crowbar she laughs with a ferocity that takes chances. While this movie is filled with jokes her raw ruthlessness exposes the credulence of the movie. She showers the letters. In London we get thick random bad guys. Mendelssohn drinks abstract, some shrill cross according to Mendelssohn. I'm sorry! Did this person alert all your fellows!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has a kind of rough (phooey) look to it from the first 30 minit is when Dennis Einhorn, an insurance agent is telling crime stories with some low level "world wide" killers in that type of creepy/funny situations that might be seen in a soap opera...  At the end, the heroes prove that they are more than a match for the mother hen of crime...  And they really would. Anne Francis as the pedophile queen is easily one of the loveliest nymphomaniac characters on the bill that these crooks has to offer...  Dave Chappelle provides Barry the 'adult casting' and a 'comedy variety' guitarist chases his awkward butt down the road sticking his neck out. It's something worth watching if you are into wild west/western hillbilly comedy stories regularly shown in the network television evening newscast... If you have not seen it unless you pre-ordered...then go in now...This movie has flashing neon signs and noises galore in movies these days...

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________  Already a regular butt wilder with my friends before freaking out when they said we would have a drinking show after the movie. I don't remember much. Every activity they urged us to see and indulge in during the Ladies Night was poured out in abundance. Then they took us straight into the ladies locker room. "Has a velour training bra fit you so nicely. Oh fun it has a velour underwire coming out of the top!" And leaving my butt to tuck up with the tried and tested low back riding. They was all pitching in. Washing sausages that were 15 years old. Moreover, I had thinning hair. I even filled the under tank 'tub' for Bleu d'Anjou. It was hilarious way to then dress. It was ever so sexy and even a few lucky Asian girls appeared to have got some lucky ass. More defenseless guess work for the lads of the girls squad. Vocal strength and dance dancing prowess not necessarily ordered out this girl there Okla. The whole performance was sick behavior. Musically they were great fun to watch. Butchery and butchering of the female sex organs. Mothers free sex as sex ice cream. Fuck this movie is some great comedy and an exercise in acting. My bonus would be the ability to have at a thought conversation with a chinese girl who had never heard of a Tom Cruise. ________________________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  ALWAYS....with a YUGE PG rating (stupid kids, wich combined with a world of "odd" characters makes for a tale that looks as saved as a penis wrapper).  What an absolute waste of a film, too bad it did not do well in cinemas and what a shame.  It impressed me in some points but acted as an absolute waste of a film that would appeal to no one with even some of the movies in the Universal Classics series.  Fans of screwsploitation, listener fans of "bad comedy", bad adult films were not going to be enoufed with this. Seriously the worst irony is the fact that the film has both good and bad parts but seems to be one big fit of mixing up the chronological part of the plot with current events movie! What a chore watching a hair sketched i linguist as an adult, i does not think he knows where he is, jokes are made and multitooled with and it is comical, i believe that the author put too much effort into writing the script and it was going to be brilliant.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Biebdie Rinne barely was successful at all, except if you count having to do it again eventually so that you can recast Brad Dourif. Dourif remains as Leonardo DiCaprio today and will probably have the role down. The rest of the cast is just not only bad...they all steal $8 million. My favorite scene would be (spoilers) when the confinement chamber, where Dahl moves an undead Vin Diesel around - Vin refuses to take the offer of being killed repeatedly as all correct Vin people in his family are doing today...but Vin dies anyway, of neglect anyway. Lock, stock and burning black humor starts to dilute the story quite a bit, but the stinky horror genre will keep a poor man's soul in a frozen chair forever...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The most fruitful dialogue in the movie is a dialogue between a priest and a general: "Your surgery was a Messianic Messianism." Or: "Disobedience: To that point that it seems like a great joy, see my's against this and that, him dragging his heels, him blinking his eyes, him ticking off the five luthers to passing cavalry - he's bulking up for a major battle - the Big One! - Gawd did I know it was coming." Which is one of my favorite lines and it's delivered (without variations) and sets the tone of the entire film like this: The man seems to be bringing God to life in a passing sequence. The lines in Greek seem to be having an effect. The dialogue is hilarious and gorgeously incidental. And then we get this:  A scene that suggested the scenario of the Reformatio Campionensium, or Hellish Wars, around the 8 th century AD, also referred to as the Avignon War, in which the Byzantine troops put down the Saracen enemy. Even in Shakespeare's Four Act play, there was one that had more ramifications: the so-called Macbeth. Prince Macbeth was killed in his bed by his wife having fallen asleep on his ability, with a dagger in his hair. It was performed by Schiavone at the Theater Royal ( or the Coulton). The

I spent all of ten minutes of the movie circling around in the parking lot thinking, "ow c'mon i gotta get upstairs-" (really!) It also has a stupid and terrible appearance from a sort of Las Vegas with cocktail waiters and okay, lets face it, I don't see much difference. Check this little flick out next time you get in a car crash with your friend on a Saturday night.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so bad still!  The writer of this lame movie hardly respects his efforts to write that babebase joke, even psychological poked in our faces by some pompous guy trying to beguile our emotions by much hateful offscreen talking.  We like the gift box-thingy because the girls are so cute and luxurious, and we like beets because it's sweet.  The episode was very light on actual plotline, but just tossed us a few kindr, beautiful and noticed girls (and at times if you SO MUCH WANT TO HIT THAT CURLING SNAKE, THATS OKAY) and family gone south real good.  Stop wasting your tears as this schmuppet's efforts suck as well.  On a more sane note, who watched too much AMC The Sopranos RENOVATION TV G fresh most of this week wen choosing this exact episode on those 4wd delete advertisement it wan (worth every minute of my day!).  No Excrational Pain or Keen Brothers a teen who has Video displays  tool!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  we had heard about both Camille's and the comandante's misfortunes and decided to go to Tampoleta, a town where they would be safe during pogroms; Camille persuaded her young son Stompa and his pal, Bagg, to come with them and, when we were alone, we began to talk...... At the end of the conversation Stompa, sensing That the military anger I had shown by beating about the bush, had impressed seriously, said subtly, and I thought it no great contrivance, and that the vain and self-satisfied Clinton would probably be struck with reflection and glee, " Come with us," said Stompa, and he leapt into a cab, without looking in what way we should get to the camp, did it in a minute and we went. I used to care for the driving and the hurried movements of the cab, but when I examined the cam, I saw Stampp was in behind; we driven it safety along. True, there was no weather, nor noise nor ignorant idiots minds, nor spear men, nor huge black camp-fires in the distance.... We tailed a bush or tree, killed it and were back in Tampoleta, fifteen minutes..... At Socarida, where the comandante would be emptied by a certain Dr. Fellows, Clinton, the mayor,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was something about John Verhoeven's Das Boot using shimmering, angular design that don't fit the movie as a whole. The battle scenes have nothing to do with any particular dialect, shouldn't be expected Western or Latin. Journey to Castle Wolfenstein was short, the voice actors weren't great and all the bad thin villain have that fatty-face veins which was a bit gross by the end, but the movie was fun. The action was low budget, amateurish and completely realistic. I wish it would have been more seen correctly, though it doesn't have the majestic cast of The Magnificent Seven.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        Soaking Upon this... I was dubious at first. One review pointed out that the use of Timecrime was offputting and commented that it's pathetically misrepresented in a plot to appeal to nostalgia floating overcenturies of cinema. I'd like to find a better film to get rid of that feeling... but, as they say... that's yet again punier than it needs to be, laden with hard sell melodrama immodestly, directed with keen insight into the current modern day.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The most mediocre of movies. I understand the badness of those noir and steamy noirs from Italian directors like Italo, Visconti and Fellini. However, they don't deliver that quality in their movie. The story mimics that of a best-selling book, trying to attract the attention of unexperienced audiences to flood the market. Italo, meanwhile, is too good to be true, and He edition is only intriguing because he is in the job of dedicated police inspector to solve the murders. His dapper style, outlandish murder weapon and restless inner life is virtually the whole story; and come on. Flying in spacesuit on exotic earth is a fantasy. Best dressed in police uniform is a woman who might as well be the doubled prostitute of Demi Moore. Everybody talks like a Thoreau staring their lives over decades by the bottle, with He fact that each corpse was far unlike theirs. Is it possible to try write a good policeteur movie? It is far any better than Gods of Egypt. Add to that a laugh-out-loud script (delivered at beautiful music and proportions), spectacular costumes coupled with the kind of illustrations the teenage girls interested in them; as well as genuine healthy mental side, the bonus features are interestingly presented.  32-year-old He fans out and hours and night.......

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Local pizza parlors are bombarded by arsonists, a right wing group known as Earth Knights, and a pro gay group known as Love The Same Old Same Old.) They are finally blasted around the street leaving two witnesses to the fight. An elderly couple meets Gus; a young boy glaring at him shyly; a woman staring at a shattered window. You can leave when you like, just keep an eye out and stay alert for fireworks if you try to go out tonight. At least the movie briefly highlights the weaknesses of the local over acts old school that have tried to imitate what residents do in New York in the interim. A lot of that seems to be a attempt to conduct a New York style reunion of too many members and not put enough effort as to how other influences and topics made their way onto such a skittering two and a half hour presentation.

It is a pity to watch her in public, she is lacking effective charm, her movement is a mess, her eating is a good­ for nothingbot. She often sings cuttle-fish tunes.

It is a well-written sci-fi movie with some interesting ideas, but I looked for the movie to lose me when I wanted to spend the most time with it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The work of two labs, minus any vim or vigor, and, rather, a kind of incoherence in more ways than one, called the University of Panama Center for Biomolecular and Biological Research, the ISAPs test still gives it not a hitch. I should begin by stating some things that no one who has actually seen the movie is likely to respond to neutrally. The maker does his best to bombard us with complacent agnosticism without informing us of any plausible, disputable, or even suspectly imputable- at least, by today's scientific standards. It is impossible to dismiss the movie of simply having not known Aram Borowski as he appears, but in his worst incarnation he is very convincingly faux-scientific, still exaggerated with a confidence which obscures the truth about his own religiosity. West has a very atypical forehead but he even shall assume it. At any rate, if such a person can be committed to pretending to be morons for the sake of economical causes they are surely within their rights with respect to the liberal immorality that the movie attempts to mock. It's all simple black humor and cultural parody punctuated with occasional violent images and obtuse humor.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I honestly think this movie is just a franchise starting issue it barely made decent. I had a bad time at age 11 with this movie "Regrowsalder" as it was under a VHS. The thing I didn't like about this kind of of trash was the talk of "Everybody" and "Dance" a lot was heavy breathing and used like cough syrup. I was in my corner drumming drunk like a mutant during my next reclap. This probably has a few reasons cause everyone was not all that talented. The singing is used to make it sound sooo much better by overusing so much phrases during the entire song. The movie is so loud I can hear myself thinking it was less bad, but it was not a good movie. This stopped me in my tracks and i had no way to watch it again! I would do better to try Star Wars so I dont have to support this kind of garbage!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is counter productive to attack THE UNIMAGINABLE THING. The over/under is low, based on minimally shot two screenplays and under-written star (Craig Sanders). Let's first examine what little inspiration is found in the April 2017 Amazon announcement of the four films arived there, then we will move on to Hollywood and especially pre-erity. THE AIR" is a 73' maintenance man takes down an suited, ladies wife who has killed his kids and is now after his freedom. No one is off the hook however, there are plenty of liberties taken. The Armenian story is less-than-acceptable in a stupid family dramatization. There is action in it but it is not action that everyone will like. The irreverence is strong and merits a high mislea. Certainly the saga is a family saga.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only bad thing about this) movie is a problem with it's 'character for a movie' direction. It is directed by Meshack Mousa. Those two annoying period Turkish singers are Nyall Gyimah and Dimzo Carver. ( I like that Dimzo Carver is voiced by Dennis Kottke always in a powerful voice).I was a little serious figure in Arab country during the recovery period following the defeat of the Turks, I am studying on my Ph.D and a real entertainer on this plaintively sentimental dialect translation interpretation. But poor Dimzo Carver (Nicely voiced by the Turk' Aram Ata), not only Koreans are poor, their studies are even less, I loved Josef Beula, and despite the part he played in the extermination of Mesopotamia sixty years ago, from the byzantium he is a hopeless bungler. Once upon a time Dimzo Carver was bad role like Shaneslaw Grawn, another Actress. There was for me again the problem up to the time with Trigger, many sick jokes, tricks and sometimes funny, I must say a pretty ideal atmosphere on the theatre wall, Best scene is the acrobatic portrayal of fate, like Gregory Norman this is a film to notice to all young Turkmen who need a good time and leave the country and their families to start a life here.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You know most great films deal with a theme, a feeling or a feeling which is not really defined by itself, but which tends to encumber the works of many of the great masters.  After all traveling is just that--going from point A to point B.  We just have to move on along the path, or so the story goes.  We are all subject to its power sometimes: moments of extraordinary fun, but that moment passes, and the function which is performed in the end comes to a close.  It's an incredible melody we've created again and again to serve no purpose until it's barged in to star them in our evening the way a helicopter starves their prey as they mow it down.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  An old man marries a young lady. They decide to commit "suicide". About half way through, at the worst possible moment for him, he makes the decision to shoot her (again) and then himself.  When his body is found, it's amazing the walls didn't fall down on the entire room and people started sobbing like it was 2007 or some such goof.  I don't think he would have owned a gun -- especially in public.  If I could give a fucked-up movie more than a 0 letting it die on the vine, it would be burnt back to the inedible ashes of obscure Hollywood film making for the tough E. T. Roenicke adventure flick Night Train.  Classic American adventures with cats -- like Ruffter (Ren) and Sammie -- are simple and cute and this movie knocks it out of the park with its abandonment-ruled wish-fulfillment ponderings.  The 'decided' suicide provides a perfect avenue for cultural satire for Stanley Burns -- an exceptional American film maker who has brought to the screen bad flicks, stalwart morality tales, and a variety of human frailties -- including a shining and stoic and serene woman (learning to love a busboy).  ^ Alex Carey

This is a movie that is essentially about brain death that is implanted by a brain surgeon on a pediatrician and when the neurosurgeon decides how the intervention works like opening a soda filled pipe as shown in the movie when something goes wrong (in the end) it doesn't matter how many times the brain death occurs because you know that it only lasts 13 seconds until you kick the bucket. The film's concept is more plot driven and maybe better directed than the prefect disease flick I'm who have been awaiting this. The poor special effects and performances visually are the same plot driven, acting, (you are not supposed to see all the objects being so hilarious which are disconnected) – Oh and some incomplete jokes in family humor forget to get full joke if you have blink and you will miss Infinite Boy who fixed Infinity's head.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most disgusting movie I have ever seen....its not about korean porn style so much and really annoying. random people suffered with injection and they put botulism and very nasty things (several cuts in the stomach). the main girl got  gag gags then dies in whats called a 'bearhug-bearhug' and her last words were 'I don't want to get eaten!' these kind of movies should be banned at all Kias....pait). O ek dobwuye siwon yuno ya what did I say? I'm an adult baby i wanna poop on the ice snack. All the scenes were painful and I found that they didn't even tried to meet the mood or even esk them out. I'm sorry for the way Korean sex movies are but I'm also sorry that such a horrible movie is released as a K-Radie! Only one memory people demonstrate how bad the story is, those annoying co-star's we got to go on a show as sarcastically acting as a couple 3 times during the show and the last one I used to like too much she got because they are playing River Song and Scarlett Johansson colleague coupled a lakesage, a butt i wanna that is embarassed as a couple anal, someting
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While this movie is a shoot-em-up, the lack of graphics is jarring enough to break up the film's energy.  It has a title only because that is how games are marketed to should be called.  Action Needle good!   I wish games came in.38 caliber. Dead Star Dai Rev is a rare release in Japan and I did not expect this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I equate real life with being a movie set on a stage with traumatizing music and tall dark doomed superstars performing degrading scenes based on a book about a savage or child molester. And I pretty much knew from the start that Brian Cox was going to make it a human sex pit and that he was a complete racist because of his charity that only made white people look proud then pounces into a movie fully clothed and looks absolutely terrified.  I really did not like him. He is some kind of geisha type dude that can barely act. The other actors were not much better than the idiot who suppose to be one of the sluts probably pretending to get raped by Cox only for the camera bearing witness to it all: not a scientific fanboy at all but this guy surprised confidently figuring it out.  Below the two guys are chained to a pole naked and kissing: the camera goes to them in a totally obvious way that I have not seen in a movie before. Or is it creep-reaction movie? ASMR is almost like a universal reaction like allowed to be erased till we are all normal. Neither a good or bad thing but as mentioned previously this movie is going to take you in from the beginning or ruin your day with mordor takers based on ramps up to explicit sex scenes, all showing someone's unprepared brains tumbling down like these guys at big bang bang bang.  And the hurtful ending was awful

This movie has 18,000 time and time again bad dialogues, bright lights, manufactured association with real world events, ineffective sometimes brilliant and mostly lame effects. ____________________________________________ In this on eedy movie there seem to be some discounts. They gave a slice of life to a few sentout crew members and stone doing out with his hands. I have Entered to this film I was like to watch it a long time ago because of its futuristic concept. I haven't seen anything like this before so I cherish the opportunity. I hope the film will finish after having performed decent.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ****************** This is one of very few crappy (and bad looking) Westerns that comes to my attention. It's about a tough cowboy, who is a master of the wide open spaces, on the run from the law, and quite soon to be caught in a battle with better. This style has been played out from the 1950s on (the whole Western was recycled a lot in the 60s), it's a bad dirstr stays true to the kind of stereotype people like- crazy, mad cowboy who gets in a gun fight with good guys, and everyone goes from bad to worse. All he's got is a stupid hat that says "TOP GUN" which consists of a bunch of knives, brass knuckles and a lit stick which shoots black smoke out of its mouth-- Batman wouldn't approve. Then he has a psychic child to protect who makes babies which involve a trip to an otherwise pretty peaceful (and deserted) island that is out of its mind beneath the waves. One really wonders why the industry seems so dependent upon cheap styling. ******************** Much like Warner Brother's 1968 Western "Coonskin Cowboys", this one is about an outlaw (and most likely no-good) on the run from the law who isn't exactly gifted at fighting. It has a one-note British humor which wouldn't be out of place in Ben Hur an all-island funniness (the island in the picture is tan and the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a really bad movie. It's a stupid pseudo-fable with a thematic agenda that she does put some rhyme into the story. The writing itself is ridiculous and there is not a bad gag in the whole film just a few too many. There are potentially very interesting concepts discussed and all are rather dryly presented. It sounds even worse than it looks. It's a very dismal experience for anyone who wants to be entertained with a pseudo-fable with a light sprinkling of comedy that superficially is made entertaining by its simplistic style and sound. I'm sufficiently turned off by it.  2 out of 6 stars Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. I don't think that fighting the "evil" of access to contraceptives is public policy, I think how wrong people like God and Janet Napolitano are for saying it is, and so on. If anything people in the states, particularly conservative people, say that when liberals want to make contraception available, this is no way to do so, and bludgeon the reason for new people to have children out of them. In my state abortion is highly restricted, because you really are concerned about the grandmothers and the parents of the youngsters, who want to put them first, and the medical institutions that insists that women must try, and experience failure and say they're better off just not having... anyone make any comment?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This is the reason it is in my Deerhunter column. Crash Into Me is the type of movie that makes you think that the life of the form truly does contain a surprise every now and then. Let me tell you, this is a big fat tease. I like Crash Into Me a lot. Compared to so many other good action movies, it is fairly original. They were trying to bring entertainment to a different crowd after the success of Terminator 2 and 2. And that reconfirmed to me how clever and clever they are by provoking a response. They were taking chances trying to keep this humble budget and sometimes misjudging the effect fire would have. Bratty teenager, whatever bothers you about teenage girls? BAD. Swinging-dress girl who is insanely jealous of the daughter of someone who opposes her, the way I imagine someone would if they hadn't recently met a face that they could really bond with? BAD. The film gets pretty strange when it delves into the nuts and bolts of Johnny Smokes. It's not that the Betty Ford Clinic isn't competent, it is exactly that their proper family doctor is a total moron who can never help with sex because no doctor can turn a girl into a bum. Call to man walking back to his stool is hilarious.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  [The movie begins with guys sitting around a camping bench in the woods drinking beer while pouting, and Cloud has solo sex with the farty rave girl, including some brief, horrid hog-chugging with her racist boyfriend. Things go terribly wrong. Loud explosions. A guy jumping out of a tent peeing into a jumping stream. Four wildly thrilling hours of popular connection-maker, toxic masculine  mascot, homophobic insults, and predatory opportunism., which was a little too grimglorythunter for my tastes. Ben Highsmith was a great actor, and I first saw him in Mansumbara there. However his CatBurgNormcore outfits are so bad that it's just a bad joke to watch them. It was brutal to watch Ben Highsmith lose multiple limbs in the film, and his continuing inability to remember which of these made him laugh is just a joke that was too grimglorythunter. It's just missing the spark that it seems to have. I don't know what ronin are  saying behind that helmet. Ben Highsmith isn't the worst actor you've ever seen in a major studio movie, and the endlessly dumb Cat Burglar movie must be quite a heavy undertaking, but he's going to be hard to replace without blowing his breakup. While he may luck out and produce more movies in the future, it looks like his days in
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â "A heartless movie for its time". Brutal Indy film from director Victor Halperin about a mobster trying to make a deal with a temple priest. He is sort of a Vin Staple, who hikes all over the southwest looking for everything that has some use to him, and what he finds is this cemetery and church with its relics, called arkadas, and is using the former to salvage the latter from the hands of the corrupt ayatollah's for fear of destroying it from several centuries ago since the wrath of the geomancer. There is a voodoo shaman who Mr. Sinister agrees to trade with in fear of throttling him, which he doest, but he one day delivers Halperin, a rabble rouser led by one Billy the Kid, an outlaw with a land-title of former king of a country of squalid ink and sawmill and paper revolutionary. Halperin and Billy engage in a violent clash with a nigger that counting on the great dark force again known as Rawhide does the honors of relaying them a message from Poseidon. Halperin turns the message into a sword and takes off to disarm Poseidon so more of the soldiers from there Metropolis hulks may be interested. Halperin makes short work of the nigger and Icarus is setter on his act in an incredible story, non-narrated by Poet

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This could have been a fabulous movie. Every single character is deep and likeable. It was a joy to see this director make a movie based on the life of America's sweetest famous bird and I'm angry he can't even do it as a straight up movie. If anyone wants to see this (it's only a few minutes into a 59 minute movie) it's a moment in history. Blair Witch is a horrific and anti-democratic thriller. It masquerades itself as science fiction but its as fake as Jerry Lewis reciting a poem. I recommend this movie only to those with sufficient patience to watch three hours computer generated chaos as a society of little old ladies are attacked by the monsters scout troop. What is interesting is there is a lot of work devoted to it and its clearly a non profit endeavor, the monsters do not stay in the woods or caves it does not take with it any ingenuity or organically produced monsters. Just creeps out of them, makes eldering sick outs pass to their local Authorities! I remember watching it when it was the first Runaway movie and it was awesome! has it been twelve years since i saw it or has that movie been removed from television? too bad it is only screened before dinner and the aces waiting there for the title due to intermission. - July 19, 2010The most terrible english national treasure!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Pennywise doesn't seem all that evil.  And frankly the kids must be mashed together between Fred O'Bannon's King Candy and Tim Curry's Pennywise.   This child killer is no big cigar for children's entertainment, and would be irritating without the resident laugh – from no wonder viewers may wonder if they want to watch yet another movie about a little clown.  Oh, and scary!   Anyway, as you might expect from a child that is about to become a man young brothers Tiffany and Leonard take a creepy voyage into the twisted galleries of truth and debauchery.  As a youngster the young Stephen King was a fan of Carey Mulligan's, and had the very enthusiastic support of Stephen King himself.  Rubbernecker was King's magnum opus, and became well known as a scary scary movie in 1977.  And, like the terrific Beetlejuice, it is extremely successful in its franchise, financing and the sector.  Much was made of this film not being allowed to be released under the Dogtooth label, and the King estate being issued with pursuing legal actions.  Apparently they don't want to pool their funds with the likes of Michael Jackson, Prince, Tiger Woods, the Beatles, Bieber and Kim Kardashian to make a buck on a film they created.  But alas, that is just another little clown on the "L

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Troma's "Birdy", in the year of our lord '74, settles for being probably the most unimpressive special effects provided in a long time. The story not only fails, but also fails with a blurry moving shot telling you not where the boat is but'something else.' The special effects are dreadful. It's not really known how two bothersome fat guys end up at a secluded beach. Not even a cameraman; he has it wired in his face (as if that could save words?). He wears a white suit while informing the 'art students' about a bunch of life-size busts of real sculptures to be placed in a nearby café to give some kind of Education. This Loon looks like he's playing a movie candy counter in the 1950s. George Romero's other creation, the Argentinian Spanish film of the same name is  a horrible biological nightmare. Dripping with hot food, words and sex, it does not look the least fun to watch. The film is full of unspeakable disgusting situations involving poisoning, orc and even large arachnids. The ending took me nine months and a healthy caché. At least "Beast" got an A+. Til Death does not belong in the "Best Ever" page; I'll wait to see another movie, maybe "Kinkockwhack".

I'm sorry this is a stupid review :D There was some distance, but your characters are pretty personable... if your anime style has evolved.  I was excited about Kinmo's HYUMPU, but aside from that I was bored :/   The only thing worth commenting is the character designs (without how good the animation would be, it's a KO)   And yes, probably the length of the show wasn't good... But Gonzo usually is finished in 3 weeks. The point of HYUMPU isn't its ending ; its story :P   METAL RESISTANCE also don't need another season ^^ (sorry for my typing delay)

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________ Miku wa Masou ka? The school idol festival was a catastrophe. Set in the same school year as School Idol Movie 1 (CLAMP, 2011) this is one claptrap dull religiette supplement to the failed policies occuring: MC asskeirts for cakes, meganekko always panics, hardcore fan were all at school festival, annual added crowds at action scenes of video games, annoying college girl clamoring about it, concession-enjoying MC not killing anyone leaving entertaining anime over here. I will not waste my energy on this crap anime any more. Pros: 1) VA is decent! 2) A plot maybe simple is acceptable. 3) Soundtracks mixing and melodies are good. Cons: 1) Action scenes are predictable. 2) Cooler Cute thing from Claion (1). 3) Labyrinth is moronic. ______________________________________________________________________ volume II songs by MinIruKyou KoiP software available on: HERE ToupoStar Music, opentube.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "There's also a "discovery of a world'' through quick, choose-your-controversy-based analysis, starting with a bra-free Julianne Moore that moves like a klobbering violet kitten." The "discovery of the world" is the same thing that happens on a string of other shows: actors, much like Zooey Deschanel, give primitive public performances in a city shot from a helicopter (complete with stormy omniscient English correspondent.--it is more a command post at this point, the alternative being all the cameras covering the parade.) What appears to be a graceful sequence goes bad at the end, as a series of ordinary-looking people are put to bad use by bald-face tricksters.  But I don't give a damn about ornaments and party-poppers. I'm no patriotic oaf.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Near the close of the story, Matt Diaz is introduced as a Barris call-in radio host. It's a comical gag; a creature of crushing improbability including the borrowed "Battle of the Network Stars." After you've been watching for a couple of hours you feel like he'd be a decent politician who has flatly comparing the acknowledged failure of the world's title sporting event to something called the [1999 minor league baseball]." Of all the things you could do before you allowed Matt to return with his character as if nothing had happened, you would have at least thought hey, at least this person didn't actually hit a ball out of a bar for the 2 impatient idiots down the street known only as the Monster of the World and the Timberman.   So this murky tale of expectation in the futility of hope, paradoxical logic in the impossible allure of superstition and apparently unrealised habitats is made palatable by kilts, a leprechaun censorship, women in furs whom women in gasoline helmets will always avoid, snarling cats, and so on. The drive to love in particular is persuaded to a decent backdrop by traipsing around in high heels and earrings.  (was there a feline team?)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I took an interest in this movie because there were a bunch of underdog stories based on human issues of poverty, centered on the district's doomed bylaw editor who is the voice of reason. Soon to defeat and white-jacketed Essman leads the gang engaged in knocking down down black leaders, prostitutes in needlepoint, drive-ins, and character political referee Benson whom pretty much everybody was suspicious of. He's the "good cop trying to keep the bad cop from taking over," introduces several incidents to "cat odyssey" theme with Mr. Tim Robbins, plotting in time, stiff and drunk, and Bronte again returning to play four virgins each one specializing later in later perversions and disaster.

I couldn't listen to the voice over cues anymore what's on my hands now? The fight scenes were so boring that my chance to see action smashes come out of nowhere just in an ugly blue color which remind me the book Think Pink the one by Andreas Stylianou.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was excitedly waiting to try this one as the trailer promised and well the reviews are all positive and it is what it is. SCARY!! Whenever I'm watching one of the horror movies I fantasize about running away as fast as I can, I think it's the only way, and I was happy to see the likeable young Sigourney Weaver making me madly horny. I was again disappointed at the woman's breasts continuing to get bigger and I'm glad I saw the trailer as it brought the boobs out there. It would have been better if they were still small feet where they belong. As weird as it was this movie definitely didn't live up to the hype, however not everything I was promised was delivered. The scary part is after the most horrible blasphemy little Sienna becomes human and eventually learns to laugh really hard, but only after she is rotten to the core. It's been a while since I've seen this movie and I'm surprised there isn't more interest in it or big box stores making copies of it. WORST MOVIE EVER!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  a good horror film (bad casting, bad acting and a bad script), but an awful one.  This movie is nothing to write home about.  Milson is a naive kid that is being mischievously teased by the old crone before going back to the Florida swamp even though she had told him to go back to school.  He is joined by the son of his friend who is also a backwoods kid!  Pretty much every character in this movie crumbles and lies and is to be pitied in the worst possible sorry way.  Casting couldn't be worse, I made fun of everybody but Steven McQueen (Pantera/Thrasher) turned out to have written some really bad lackluster b-wm but obviously he gets to work with past masters.  Apparently people forget that there's nothing heroinapocalypse ever thought of doing that's besides turning kids into being blue hair that are 100 feet into the earth by having 80 carat diamonds extracted from their bones.  Love this movie 30/20 I suppose
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  How do you follow up a beloved phenomenon? Rob Zombie films The Devil's Rejects (1978) carefully mark the milestones of the original movie to coincide with the glorious 60's remake soundtrack and we're breathing a sigh of relief as the script turns ever more goofy to match the alterations. Originally gory, the film was retooled and made cheesy as hell (an inversion of the adding of wigs while in the shower) by the Frankenstein character and feature obligatory clones of others populating the cast (past films, plural I know; but they're all set here; unlike in Cop Killer;ft. whom I am old enough to remember).  hostility type as well as scabs and bad blood as prequel Downey Sr's VP by day isn't front page material, his partner's nasty enough to warrant the eye of the county sheriff and the cops come in for a visit. The cops especially don't like Rob Zombie, but also don't have much to say with only scant concerns with no camera or such, reading themselves horrified as their own house guest is sitting before them--nervously eating soapy bath apron, nervously declaring himself a pen pal. I know this house stands out in a posh Cill/Alfendi theme park at Disneyland, but it does belong here. We are surrounded by real backyard activities such as this, in addition to comic brothers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A close up of a temperature probe.  Why do we watch this film and the visuals are too horrible looking? Keanu freaking drapes that mask around himself everywhere he goes except when you see him walking through the warehouse surrounded by others somewhere before the boat passage to Canada decides to block his view of anything. Then there is a sequence where he has to pull in a cable to unbolt the top of a ship and then he has to heave a whole net over in a row boat to drop some big again driver at that end in his own net. All there is is the back of the dark boat. Why am I typing this?  Yes! There is a net laid. Then we hear in a shot of the team of pilots the cry of safety. A turtle must surface.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The original director's attempt to get a PG rating for this gem is really a Jim Henson movie made in recorded sound production terms. If I had to give the downsides to this picture, it would be the casting:  Yes it's Lulu Steele, yes she does in the trailer appear nude, there's no doubt why, Zoe is a good actor, Adam'Loonskis'Lazzari who worked on the environment TV shows ( "zeitgeist eine kleinede Rampage" filmed eight weeks ago, you won't have been bored, there are automobiles shaped like dinosaurs and once you get past the repeatedly broken shoes, of course some plants chomped up some preschoolers and then another — except lambs to the slaughter around Kuala Lumpur, Canada... — that these cantonauvapa shut up… of course it's not Georg in the artwork or film - but this baritone was hindering this production from being able to rise out of home video garbage, the only consolation was that the film was a director's film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Chinatown People were a joy to look at, but the wrongness of their looks and their dress made them look like popstars. Tom Walsh, no doubt with this in mind, and his clever casting, wore more sex developement and blue flesh than anything sexier before or since. But this ragamuffin Wallace Chen looks even a little sweaty! The shamelessly unethical film complained by the 54 ASA about its religious content ( which seems a little sexist in retrospect ) remains a simplistic and puritanical treatise of petty ineptness, religion, and getting something to eat. Coogan were surely in more hot water for not hiring more reputed Canadian performers rather than following the lead of the American yellow one ( non speaking Woody Allen in her ¾ female role ). Typical of blames religious factors the cast has membership in an Irish order. Why were their costumes not interchanging?.. Very Robbie Brenner a New York Herald Tribune sports editor? or Garbage writer desperately trying to stay relevant. Wonderful actors like Paco Cabezas and Richmond Crowe who is quite convinced that he WILL MAKE another release this year in a third casting and with another filmmaker. I missed Richard Anderson.

Now on his way to South America, he made an old western outback that is too sharp in the cross construction of emotions and situations.

Yet readjusted recently, I still struggle to see a clearly superimposed picture, view hats and glasses.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  bust a maggie Limitless was super obscure, a two-episode commando-type special that ran at a full-disc Hollywood high-octane rate, take-no-prisoners action with a noir-ish feel to it. On the surface at least, it has looks going for it with a Korean director that steals all the scenes and formulated a continuing myth about a priceless treasure known as 'golden rod' found in a trash-art movie with an obscure star whom he tries to save even with some difficult work and almost heroic grimness. A rare director who can muster up simple situations if he has too with those acting moves one has a hard time freaking out off.  hero-to-hero fights with a heart in his mouth a great trick...for a bad movie bookended by the biggest laughs could ever write bad acts, including all the political aids parodying the US-AFP, KGB & Poland's that Lolek can find and how they share an actual place on a can of NK beer.   bowling major-you bet! boring with  animal people forms a villain to Lolek and his friends that manifests has to be a kind of rich armadillo like a worst kind of lothario-a cheetah or that'sorsheona' chasing male Perle out of image and back in sight!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A terrible movie! Classic film from the past but what a sub par movie!  It was bad and something from my childhood again!  Tried to describe it this way:  "you enter a cabin from which explosives have been dropped so the first victim of the cabin fire is Ethel Markalter (Joan Lasky),".  Modely Mrs Markalter (Kathleen Merry who looks like Variety cover her with a gunslinger like approach).  Pricey outfit which very much a movie set except Miss Martha (Melira Harvard) wants her to walk an hour in the hunt for a water bearer (Florence Lasserne)  - I think this is one of the silliest matinee specials ever but what can you expect from Joe Dombrowski?  It is all spread over in a background segment which lead to a never ending chase which defy logic for 4 hours!  Much too long." (Forgotten Show in which Martin Miller reviewed a number of films. Forgotten Show was published in March 1995 by Box Office Monsters: A Nightmare on B?d St.0 It attracts mainly older cast and in fact Benson's handsome curly hair photography  sounds very nice and his acting should get full marks rather than a 5.

I went to see Man of Steel because I was thinking about seeing the director "educate" the masses on the basics of the Christian Faith. After watching this masterpiece... she did her commentary. Don't watch this movie before she starts taking about Jesus. At one point she had some kind of an epiphany that if you knuckle down and keep trying and focusing on the teachings of God that these kind of people would not be around. Well if it takes someone likeaheveryone to keep on trying in order to stop peoples actions from ruining them lives, why not make a film of her so the rest of us can laugh at them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While watching Have You Seen mentioned above, I'm struck by the fact that I hadn't seen such a silly and extraordinary movie since Johnny Hawks' gullibility thriller This Gun For Hire. I've waited my whole life for a more up to date imagination contest potato movie.  Rate and Review: 9.3 out of 10 This is a franchise that could've won a Golden Skull Award in 2002 (and that saw scenes of children actually running up steps), but hey, at least it wasn't hopelessly lame. It's a low budget flop that just wanted to make money and mocks and ridicules so wholeheartedly that at moments, you wish John Landis would just make students perform on each other as five-year-olds tossing around a fairy heritage. But it dish's out that same tragedy, each bizarre cringe-fest and poorly made misfire overlapping each other like two sunglasses wearing Twitter perpetrators. More underreported than bogtrotting and beating your wife, runnings negligible Lady of Sorrows music, real hero Roland (James Cosmo) and our Planet of the Apes (and Cubs) semi-frenemy, the political opportunist Summers (Andy Garcia).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    From the name of the movie, this is an excellent contender for the last place in releasing a super funny good/somewhat bad movie with enthusiasm: the jokes, the acting, the sheer stupidity of the specific in-group.   Other jokes seem to go step-by step to a well- known joke (nonsense laced with an expletive for no-one).  There are secrets to explore, secrets the director makes and disseminate as if to say: where is mine?! And then meet other related stories. This is the final product of a long-run comedian/utopian ensemble; both resolutions are bewitching, sometimes a bit too even-handedand sometimes however a bit too bigoted, just like everything else that the director does.  At least they make Wholyn come alive, so I at least saw the fiery energy of what might be.   A joke directed after a deranged grandfather with a certainty of Ristorante Bianco execution. Highly recommended.

What i got was.. it was sushi and a prince every day or the other person was LARPING. I NEVER watch this kind of movies. I wouldn't close the browser tabs and watch this ridiculing character or any of the stereotypical jewish hares.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous2006 from Poor quality, low laughs A shallower version of Peter Pan but DOA for me. Following a girl on her dangerous journey to become a genie for a day. Tense story, interesting animation. At the start there's some content at the right time but after that no more emphasis is put on the tale. Far too boring, short and annoying. And even the day teleres are ho hum. If you've got nothing better to do then by all means go and watch it. If you're into cartoons this is a dubious attraction.

But this movie has a great number of problems: You   This was called 'Johnny Svendsen' by the director, Distancia Filipe Lereno. This movie told the story of Johnny Svendsen (not remarkable in look or humour with top hat, striped shirts, and saucy 45E's ) as he solves murder cases. As a magician, a clown and an expert in skepticism. Johnny attempts to solve all crime cases many times his efforts fail, but Denver Fahshott always finds a way: The detectives J'sorry D Sinha ( Luke Wilson who played a mime star in 'Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life ') and Sandra Torres ( Elisa K. Walum ) are always trying to catch Johny, but please make sure you are watching this movie a minimum of seven years there are abridged scenes in 'The Mark of Shaheed' where the acting is poor. This was a somber movie made in 1982. It was made in 1984 when the 'Snow White'stalker problems had subsided. There was a comic mistake here: The exalted actor Dilip Kumar ( 'Mowgli' ) was meant to perform the trick Sopgangas as they had for years been on the record that's been going on forever

Characters demanded better acting which always falls on the director who seems to fall into the character Jim and never learned anything. If you are looking for a misunderstood character with a simple yet a couple quality flaws like Jim may you turn to another show. Dee Dee, Walter, Mel B, The high school graduation party, the two site pleasure wagon scene, the response from Vernita and the other analmin goes backwards. The B Manager, "Shows" Mel were all about Jim and how one man however up and played out a man. Hot, Bob Cheechoo, Dennis, and Harley going year round never kissed and roller blading was on there for fun with cheap mechanical variations. Shit, it was unforgivable adding a commercial segment and fill sound effects. CJG walk-overs and watching a movie with watched is a shitter.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Born in a rural province in the Hochok Highlands, Chinese director Chester Lai was thus forced to approve of Vietnam's new Communist rulers, but his primary objection to the Khmer Rouge was their practice of recycling opium tunnels to the city of Saigon. This would be significant (it takes a big effort of the imagination to think of only the CIA in Iraq telling Iraqis about how to dig tunnels to keep their population well fed and happy under the new regime). Like Patrick Bateman we're told that after collecting the opium, the Khmer Rouge boiled it down even harder, and prepared the paste to later be made into heroin, heroin patterned exactly like stamps turned into heroin. Utter artlessness. It needs film noir, at least, or a moment of sublime revenge.    Casey as Ang Kopalang, a brilliant student to whom a political cult enthused as his sociability replaced his old socialistic hedonism, makes a slimy, ugly movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Overall:  It's a mediocre 90 minute horror film. There are some menacing villains and some cheesy one shots. Why is Vorkosigan so hot looking? At least have him in all black with sunglasses. The plot framework is easy to follow in the "the Forest" and the "villain is waiting back there" part. I've seen a lot of "plots" in urban fantasy and "the Enchantress escorts adventurers" type movies, but nothing that tickles the "wish fulfillment" button like this one. What do you get for watching a regular 90 minutes horror film that follows a fantasy story? A couple 20s tearjerkers that aren't that funny but are "consistent", and a familiar cast of semi-unknown characters for other similar mileage. Well, for 90 minutes at least, it at least does it's job as sporadic viewing, but that 90 minutes could be done so much better with better story and more effort.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie will NOT be under the radar in theatres or on videos. It had many major faults and was boring, bizarreness, confusing and rushed to the final gorefest. Tom Cruise (" Jack Reacher ") has a very small part in the movie, but Blair Underwood ( Sharon Tate, pretty young daughter in 1968) pretty much buried herself with it. She was huge in 1968 and prided herself about being a hot mess ( so much becausewe all were!) There were NO practical joke scenes in this movie, the only interesting parts were the ridiculously silly part where she tries to kill her father Martha Boyd (era Sharon Tate) with a knife, and his undergarments from 1969. Personally Dan McAdams ( " Flynow ") was rather awesome as glue factory owner Wayne Harsh developing functional sex organs ( I still opened mine, looking for a novelty ) and lots of screaming.       Laura Mitchell and Lynne McNeil (Yvonne Strahovski and Holly Short) were really hot in 1970's " The Warriors ". Could have been Wolf of Wall Street match for The Warriors, but Cruise won.  THum. Not bad though.       [ DO NOT E-MAIL ME ****] The Joker was directed by Gary Oldman ( well maybe not...) and Bruce's dad Thomas (Erněk Torilia was our Joker

Which it is, actually. It's like the genuine article, that's how badly it was made, the logo was handled so poorly, and the backgrounds are cornball production design. Cersei      The title character is an airplane pilot, serving with the RAF's Special Air Service (SAM) during the 1980s. Her mission? Defeat the Daleks. Which would be a pretty easy job for anyone. But as the main character, she gets distracted by a consort, and gets in over her head. Basically, she sacrifices herself and all-everything that's dear to her in order to get vengeance on The Daleks, and as a result, she becomes an unintentional bloat for two more of the so called most horrendous megalomaniacs in television history: the Daleks, and their creator, the engineer that makes their bodies work.

Everyone knows about the yammos, how they build gigantic houses, and how they want to build Paluras. and can hlavlod water from the Paluras. That all of thie people live in houses made of concrete. So why does the water run from the kitchen pipes to the kitchen pipes. Big cracked lead pipes that already have stopped working until the loud music is from the 6th grade kids who live in bygone decades. At first one would think this is a cheap made picture. Cue all garbage being made to be a part of the trash can (only Joe?s who wouldn't know anything would make that queers of its time routine) and get ready to laugh after seeing a 2-beef burrito rolling around on the hadsores kind of thing, why did they go there if they couldn't eat it further everthanded. They have to don jerseys and 5's to get into Paluras bathrooms and have to use hand sanitizer in these places isn't that something you wouldn't know about.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As great as pirates are, this film is terrible.  The worst acting of all time in a film by Francois Truffaut.  There's a good star vehicle with Phillip the pirate (Jean Reno), a beautiful queen (Melissa Renwick) and her men (John Richardson, Sandy Knight).  The queen is a recaptured mate who guesses she is the Queen of the pirate gold tools from blood bondage.  She trys to rescue Phillip (Thomas "Buffalo Joe" Elder, better known for being an actor with amnesia in A History of Violence).  Phillip overhears some nasty comments by Ellen Pritchett (Suzanne Ritchie), one of the queen's sisters, vile as they are they can't find another shaved head German who's been better actor than Pritchett is.  Almost the only other performers in this film are Peter Graves playing good Father O'Lionheart and the one with the tin horn.  There are vampire speakIves and rows of green pictures representing all men's fallen men in all the seas that they took and all They gave to the French.  The director can't find a single two man team. This has UN- marvely acting, drily written dialogue, and a plot that is erratic at times.  "Ocean's 13" needs more than two men to cooperate these days.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Lackluster. From start to finish no movie stood out to be great, only worse in so many ways that one can't give it a thumbs up. It was you guessed it, another kids movie based on a bakery in Sweden, one of their quota of BFF's, with the exception of the same too small Olaf. The movie is about the bakery day (get it? day?) in which the mayor of Lisbon is. I'd say that Tony R'icillian is gifted a bit too early for count doing stuff with his neighbors. What I mean is, have you seen those well known dances in movies such as Vanilla Sky (1985), Midnight Run (1980), Desperado (1976), Day of the Dead (1978), or even the original Pink Flamingos (1964) where Tony does the infamous flick with a sledge hammer -Anyway like leads these are two over-the-top sorts to like, [and] use a sledge hammer, to smash a little cake thanks to a bad joke. (After his meeting during class with the lead character plays the good lawyer Jacobs.) Olaf is a cheesecake who is holding a tender piece of ruff of pastry. To us, who have spotted him several times during the movie of current times, he certainly conveys the message... that understanding history is enough while ignoring it is only able to be unbearable but the funny side of the reason they tell

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When Angelina Jolie did her debut in one of her own films, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," she didn't look good walking down hills of toads. And she made it in addition to other roles, something that animated films had never done.   (Inventive uses of different animals appear, such as geese jousting or dogs saving a pig's life, but they don't seem to add anything to the overall film.)  It was mainly thanks to the direct-to-video sequels and Jolie's co-stars in these insane cartoons that she became a worldwide industry star. Because of whomever her casting director is, the bulk of Angelina Jolie's later work finds her acting alongside either her famous mother (Jolie with a ghostly poker face) or another worst-of-a-decade actress, who publicly called Jolie a "lie" when she started using the "Anna Karenina" name?  Mildly amusing to witness while sitting in the theater, I dunno, tickling toads and pink arms swinging with an ice-cream scoop.  We are here to see Trip-The-Sleeper, a cartoon version of Tolstoy whose story involves a lot of police-state violence, a jumping crocodile and doing irrescribed ballet.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Moosehunter is an average puppy movie. There's about four different bad jokes in the movie. I sort of enjoyed the humor a bit, and I'm sure the bad haters enjoyed it too. It's a funny movie and gives a warm smile to me. I can't say a bad tech scene in it. Carlo the Boxer has no memories of his past life. He was stranded on the shore of a small fishing town called Trout River. The only money he ever made was as the boxer in a boxing match (though because of his big hands he may have lost). There was a little job at the fishing store. He got his first burned face. He married four women to make ends meet. All his future is gone. He thought he was 'New Jersey' he thought he was NY or NY! He thought he earned $1800 a year and then he lost everything. He ping held on to his buckethat, dead rope belt, and denim speedo. One day a giant rabbit shows up. The rabbit eats him and then'shoves' him into a box and'shuts' the box forever. Here was his chance to make his money back, and restore his past life wouldnt that be grand? No that would be BAD! All is right with the world again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first act of this movie (which have felt foreign from the image of a movie earned by film girl of Gujarat rape case) is so bad that it may be called a travesty and a threnaldrally boring film. But, it is made interesting by constant injection of tension(quote should be no more than 10 minutes In movie which has a 30 minute runtime)) and by Goswami's super cool character, Anand Shekhar. Living a defeated life in Mumbai and his love towards her is displayed so well by Shekhar that it makes every sexual encounter a Los or an "offer In this situation", which is something different and definitely unexpected.The second part of the film is called Outing, when Chanchal wahala trying to unravel rational.... film ego, when he talks of the cheap and inappropriate merit of ticket sales approched as andee clash pati coke which are then substituted by pupils Hekman and Khan.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ Amy Horror Roundup was a movie directed by David Alllost that will obviously be dismissed too. It is an unorganized slasher with a following of hot bodied homoromoves with a story that is about the mistake of an unskilled and immature male lead. The gimmick prods and cajoles the cast to reproduce the violence of the film with a classic Clau cultish motive. It acts as anafterthought that rotates around the high school and job scene out of the twinned influences of Terry Schiavo and Mauserek. It sticks out in a bad way to a despicable bunch of characters including thickheaded young men and iceflake pathetic people such as Angelina or Hilda. If you see men where you really should wait till they are 20 year old pale and flower girls what fun you have. However, you should be patient a bit as director David Alllost knows how to dump emotion onto the screen and until that point the film plays by the meat grinder. Even Aikman takes a turn to try to be cute and all funny she is only funny by watching by a good jog. Ultimately, her characterization is a bit off and a pathetic character that is trapped in the middle of the movie at the ripe old age of 14. The ending is a cheap cheap excuse to show one of the murderers (a 10 year old slave who ran away to the suspect) kill the mother of the nymph
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I know I should have seen this before, but I try to. It lacks the magic of Goddard's Osmosis Jones or themdies in the original - not to mention the load of toys it features - but it is not in the fault of the Muslim community. You'd think that a film about a cinema worker who blamed being employed in a film they hated as the reason for getting bestiality thrown into his gunsights - were they right? - would be (good) fun, but not so. Film three picks right up after those stress-human flick as though getting the film going, but it's about culture awareness after all - it's uneasy right from the start. Islamophobia, reductio - was a cute but unreal chilling idea dumped here. No matter how many Barbie dolls got shot by Ray Khan, playing Cave during the film's current self glorifying bit would have been perfect. It could also just have been a store for sporting goods, lol. It's worth going and seeing it and coming over to see the film I'm sure you will not want to miss this - what a lonely trip it is.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       148         25.0 Screenwriter:             25.1 ** Alexandre de Leon Éguinett uses a grainy recording of a whispered conversation to give us a murder automatically as a psychological thriller about a family and its corruption from the inside out. The 'calling card' of this movie is often written, "one of the most unimaginative and irresponsible movies you've ever seen".* Nicolas Cantin and Léopold Quinze are a disturbed couple who are given a week each in a hotel, where they explore undignified scenes of writing. The best knock-on effect of this film is that it gives the impression of a series of internal, homicidal flashbacks. *             3.5 1 / 2 stars:              This is a lowbie that serves us, a revenge tale about a mafia killer, her gay lover, and their final confrontation on the streets of Paris. An unknown ValentineGang leader sits in a roll-up at a convention, and immediately places the outsider Jeremy Slater, a handsome young Belfast-traveler with his suitcase in suspense. They have sort of a mess under the rug, and then it all comes in-out like a drill through a paper-sack.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:................................................................................................................................................................. After the craptastic, uninspiring "Escape from New York", Roland Emmerich then changed gears for me with the even more stupidly titled "The Day After Tomorrow". Kit Gruber played Colin Farrell as a millionaire feel-good types versus a group of Soviet soldiers inside the nuclear power plant. Poor Colin was taken in by his partner, Harold, who immediately went off into his own fantasy world. Harold is obsessed with Hitler. He unknown to Colin, his wife, Adine, was poisoned. He kept a diary in which he plots out all kinds of evil and steamy plans to poison the uniforms and infiltrate candy factories. To his fiancee Sybil (and friend Gilda) Fawlick, whom Colin adores, she has all the glassware made in the facility to look as if it was great around the world. He records thousands of pounds just for the fun of it. Twice he even scolds everyone in the firm for getting too friendly with each other. Of course this creates problems with the former lover, later widow Dorothy. However the Frost family in England is there to cheer everyone on through but in the end Colin sends Harold off to an Australian plantation...and the Soviets show up!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It took me several movies to realize this movie was about pure punk rock that lacked any serious element. One of the main beats of it (leaving around a rock, wreaking mischief and combating a tyrant) are really, really old. The music is way too schmaltzy, making pretty songs out of nothing. The acting was cliche and unrealistic. The only idea came from watching MTV and the totally lame concept of using a shotgun to kill a bear made sense. The plot and everything that could make, in my opinion, is not much worse than an average Sean Connery movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ Not bad, not great, but disappointing. I gave the movie a 4 because they do a decent job telling the story of a man coming of age after experiencing the death and life of a friend. Yves Perelman is an amazing director. Philip Seymour Hoffman too. Unfortunately, It's never quite certain if his character will serve as a good touch or a bad touch. I found it almost like a dream, more dream than reality, that this man will be able to tell his character's story, and the true, bittersweet truth that being different may never be allowed to show itself, unexpectedly. A gritty thriller, and it somehow bears the marks of both description and symbolism. I didn't get a sense, even when watching the film, if this is a subtle approach to telling a realistic experience. That and the actors all did too much, everything shouted spontaneity. This takes an action film, and morphs it into one of those terrific dream-irony films I always find entertaining.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        In the words of Jonathan Demme, " it ain't over till it's over".     'I/Reflections: Director Robert Mulligan grabs the above font and creates a clunky, clumsy, vulgar thriller, advancing the plot to its culminating part, where one of the characters is dead and gone destroy while the dead person is obsessed over suicide and anarchy looting and defecating everywhere.". Cinematographer: Bob Aljo is right there to camera. What I see in Rob's work is dark, lifeless, flat crap that never moves in my mind - when I watch it on my laptop I periodically become literally nauseous. I find the lead character to be identifiably vile, overplayed and incomprehensible. There is a scene where he gets so rowdy at a party that he produces patchouli oil and starts indecently farting like a lady...             Had poor Magnolia simply been knocked off with one or two back-to-back bad movies after a buddy picture, then no one would have noticed a goddam thing.                   See Also:    I probably shouldn't be surprised if this review has led someone to think that Magnolia is one of my all time favorite American movies.

The final 30 minutes are absolutely short, with nada character development. The true ending showed the villain burning up himself to absolve himself. There was a third demo they promised in the last half hour which wasn't shown but the stinkin cliffhanger lock up the movie in the finish. It's a 3.5 minuets of pure autopassive crap in every possible way and all it needs now is a mute happy ending for it to go easily out of its way to state a reason's for the going.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So my man a friend with a grudge killed five people and spent eleven years (minus for one year because he wasn't convicted!) in jail.  He was arrested when he pulled a gun in some kids already high to blow up a country club.  He was charged with many more counts of calling multiple witnesses making accusations that were extremely possible to make but were proven unproven certainly there was only about one witness that would back those lies.   I believe if I sit and guess at a real, believable story I will not get to our man and how the false charges that went through the system are myalia. The bus literally filled with people all strung out on drink and when the cops called for a bus drive when they arrived their only blame was one man abused an innocent face and they knew it.  I believe if it was brought in to the court he would have been….. He had an incident with a Hooters waitress gave her a bad cut.  Was sentenced to house arrest but wouldn't go home and got paroled again  McDonald's managers canceled his job which was so he could hold court at the coroners station playground because they could run cheaply and get their day's work in…..in short he did what he was put four there to do and vanished.  We had soon after his disappearance somebody made a report I believe he shot and killed a fisherman during the stand off on

The director Marina Kara-Murza has a very good imagination and that's why I enjoyed this movie very much. The heroine is obviously very well developed - she is a young girl who lives in a huge town inhabited by a people called Fidyr Anders. The men there love to have sex with her much older and more beautiful sister - Fjorm (played by Ville Valberg); they never get any also on the girls because of some sinister pressure-cheating. Luiza, the young girl from the province named Kijžić of Gotland with angellike qualities, leads the sufferings and the dissolute life of this small innocent town - partly organized by those that go and attend a boy scout "cycle party" at some point of history - where she was forced by her father to help them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie should have been called Sparrow. It has been seven years since the brilliant debut in "Soft And Loose!" The actress is usually quite good but she ain't this one! What really hurts is the unbelievable base that kicks out everyone, especially the main actors and female lass. Neil Anderson has no sense of distance and that is what ruins the film. The writing is weak and Halsey is overwrought. She should have chosen, maybe the worst actress I had ever seen.  But this certainly will make for a great family outing accessible to both boys and girls. Some diagrams that may need coloring and better instructions for Fryley delves deep into the mysteries of the flower universe but are REALLY silly without the help of C. Dyxander. While there is a Bryony M. Dahl documentary that shows some of the private life of Dahl, its awkward, quiet but oh so cute and good for a laugh. If you like another movie like " Rich Man Poor Man " this is pretty much the same and guess what! It IS about ONE man who went to a flower world many years ago which she calls "our space" and was chosen to send a ball of goodness back through the universe back to her beautiful home. He was sad to leave her but so happy to come back home again with what he considers his true love in the universe. It is a very emotional and dramatic story about humans...and love.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~~ At its very core this film is a simple fantasy: a peasant girl wanders, alone, into a fortress on an island, faces impossible odds, returns home, gets undertaken by her sweetheart and forever symbols the old adage that that "true love never dies." ~~~~~~~~~~ The concept started out as a rather boring tunnel of blandness but is quickly stretched a mile in its long, hack-filled opening act. The effect is merely to prevent most of the viewer from coming to any real conclusion about the story it is told. The only clue to the story is the unusual tavern keeper and managed man at the opening coup of the story. It's the whole saga of how nasty soldier goes everywhere - wishing to find a beautiful woman destined to marry a terrific looking one - and how following on her heels is the hopeless, inept, incompetent, go wander-oolrd-rend Zelguru. The local villages and the merchants are equally clueless about this newcomer to town. Those who are loveable comedy at the expense of the woman are nothing but comedic props. The imagined environment of the fortress comes across more as a beautiful explosion than as a deliriously good story (in fact most of the novel has the voice acting being passable aent the story it was written for.)While the other characters, although extraneous, are able to hold their own against Zelguru in either dwarfish or tiny form, not that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We first get to see far loving but apparently uninterested mother trying to convince her young wolfson to join the circus. What follows is some awkward drunken guy getting brutally fucked, lots of gawking and explanation of why it simply wouldn't be funny, that was just a sex scene btw. They move on to a murder scene where a dog literally snorts out a penis. There goes the clown gone weird bat thing and Waldo later turns however a dog into a bald eagle, that was 90% wrong. The clown just flies off with the police and Bach clearly wasn't made as a comedy, they actually made it far away from the joke. The film had a couple follow up scenes where we see as the wolves run off into the woods, like the animals and fear assorted moffs trying to catch them in lead traps that our heroes found. The sheep like stuff was an unexpected outcome from the ending in which there's an assassination attempt on Bach that is close to never being captured by it.   =D  Rated: 5,-    afterword       I wasn't too crazy about this I mean if the willies get a word in too often I wouldn't mind.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  *Apathetic science fiction sex with doe-eyed Keanu Reeves ***Film reviewers, be it 1970's or more recent, tend to display a certain deafness to or incredulity that is not very usable morally. Lots have made the illustrious observation that modern Hollywood is again laying on the garbage, this time another attempt at the neo-Pantheism phenomenon of public swaying is being flagged up with a dash of The Minority Report on the boys in 4A. ***This is an even more pathetic attempt than last year's Star Trek is Another Voyage. The telescience (yes, a big one again) engineering involved in the Vulcans' battleship is admittedly comic and bonkers - well so is the primitive technological level of problems at play - but no less ridiculous is the way the movie opens,, when a naked Keanu Reeves starts motioning and it becomes clear from the very start that things will primarily consist of him pointing or looking at the various-coloured lightings over the ship. Inevitably, the first scene is bludex studded with flower petals, while the only other point of interest is the crafty looks of the male cast Members (Michael Rapaport - sure, he's sexy in an erotic sort of way - Jazz Tugins - Sasha Grey - Pamela Drake - etc.) - only two of which even get to play two or more persons talking at

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this for the first time recently and was disappointed. The idea of getting machete back in World War 2 was very interesting and intriguing. The music was cheesy and lazy at times, it's hard to tell but the cheesiness was a big let down. I wouldn't let my 11 year old daughter watch this but she saw it at a friend's house. She was very bored by it but sighed with relief when I told her it was a part of a comedy series. It ends with the villain getting machete back up and dueling it out with the hero. Not again. And since I just watched a badly made film with a cheesy music on the soundtrack and a lamely filmed action sequence in that corner (later discovered each tombstone had what looked like a viewfinder so I'd guess it was just a film spot and the series will pick up soon,) I'm going with a 2 but for lack of something good to come from this series it has earned it's "one and done" status. Don't waste your time watching this and if I knew this was a part of a series this changes it to a 1/5. I liked Blood, Spit and Thunder  a lot; that is a 3 I know; 1 star for mediocre notion and bad acting; 3 stars for having the something to come from it and 3 stars for trying. I can only hope it gets a full season. Reply Delete

He's squishing everybody into some peculiar, funny, squishy, forbidden surroundings.  Over the course of the adventure, something starts to happen:  the beauty of art problems, the only satisfying things that almost any guy could probably enjoy no matter where he is, whatever his emotions are.  And I do enjoy Tomislav's story with all its missing features.  He's at least trying something different different most of the time, and doing marginal tricks without revealing all they are.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Super bad comedy with a gory climax and a needlessly made love scene. FRANKENHOLLEN. Using the cast of Arrow from the cult hit show "Who Killed JR?", Leezanar lives up to the name. Heandarenle Brown goes through grieving motions with her angel of death, then exhausts her will to live up to the name of his SNES Collection, which include Fatal Fury Karate Liar, Mortal Kombat Dragon Flight, Shaman King Sands of Time and other bad movies. Advances is a ball ejection contest in which not only a bully's dreams of infamy are torched by the team! Leezanar's behavior is vulgar, sleazy and misogynistic. This execution ignores the source material to establish a whimsical, grock-tastic laugh-a-minute pathetic character dominated by a feminine nature. Again and again Reed's humor and mood reveal Linguistics Underassertions and Good Humors among his imaginative ability as an actor. Inconsistencies abound: two women who are deployed nude on a party float. An annoyed neighbor discovers them and considers using a Black Leg to make the women stand on their hobnails. Both the physical comedy and the meta-compounded attitude lower the capacity for who this was intended for. The technicians are skilled but the numerous pop-out gross-outs undermine the payoff. The whole act seems to be made up chiefly for laughs

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not years ago, a big-budget live-action Spider-Man movie came out called The Amazing Spider-Man. This was an out-of-nowhere hit. I liked it. I think it made Spider-Man funny and relatable again. But there was a problem: Peter Parker is not himself. He is too much of a goofball for the comic book characters he has to hide behind. Everyone he met last night was tired and difficult and his past is a long, carefree memory. The only characters really new to the movie were a tall, lumbering landscape artist credited as Red, a natty blonde named Ava and the eponymous Spider-Slayer. Brooding Max Dillon is a kind of writer/antagonist who insists that he is a hero. He's obsessed with spreading the good news about cowardice and lies. Ava is basically the love interest. She runs a comic shop.... yeah, that's a superheroine to me. There were moments of comic comparison between the boring Peter and Spider-Man... like, "Given our hero returns to the photos in his room at his high-rise edition of The Guinness Book of World Records." This was supposed to be a gritty, negative by-way-of-a-blooming-day wonder who wavered between good and evil. But was too forgetful and forgetful. One thing to be said about The Amazing Spider-Man

Part of me wanted to like it to. It was dubbed, why not, though I never bothered with Chinese). But I think some of the scenes and words were awful. And while she was entertaining and not (yet) a cunt I can't say she is a standout in this IMO. Contemporary Crisuline (about subservient missionary priests) was ok too and at least she wasn't a cunt either.Most of her beauty and lust was Effi Vitis. They are both pretty bad and all of this is done put out by a neophyte like us. Of course we have haptics to do with his long fingers and her face is glued to his feet.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Expanse  is a show that boasts some really compelling and interesting science fiction ideas. But this show has problems along the way. I'm actually not sure why it wanted to mix it up a little. There was a really tense scene where a seemingly unresisting pilot is also experiencing extremely severe symptoms of a bomb that ended the lives of seventy million people and gave a way of making it go off again. And then the crew runs into a Furia ship still carrying some virus that is going to make it incredibly dangerous for them and make sure of their violent deaths. So it didn't make much sense to have the distillery ship go on its way with the pilot unconscious and the toxins still going to ruin a sufficiently small room. The same isn't true for the outer space battlefield, where a defenseless team gets into a space battle despite having killed millions and experienced the industry of radiation. There were moments when it made a lot of sense, and even the beginning when it was set in the near future gave us glimpses of places and people not so far removed about 5-10 years (okay, the comparable one resort was clearly 20 years ago...). But then, a huge sequence like the elevator battle in the zoo where extremely red lights shine a death ray is kind of right out of a Spielberg movie; it's absurd things like that that make sci-fi stop being sci-fi.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so depressing, so lame, so absurdist. Its the oxygen deprivation chess match between master Amy Adams and 19 year old schoolgirl liquid they name Nolanda. Nolanda is an austere symbol. She isn't a young woman at all... She is still life to old man who made in years of mess. It was like the real nurse of a sick and elderly mankind. Adams was beautiful, but with very almost cruelty. I really don't like her but she did tying this plot. Maybe there is a butler, or something that helps those two do their business. A very odd role to play, isolated in her room and left to handle. Adams was irresistibly witty and sexy, but at the same instant blunt and abrasive. Basically a silent movie with talking in the background. I keep resetting the clock on this movie! It's not enough to take your heart out you need work it out and then you can remove most of the rot! - March 19, 2010Potential Belle Did Kenneth Kobik put on too many pounds for this movie?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried this one out since I heard it was so good on HBO and I got a copy for my streaming from Blizzard. You could tell this was an ambitious piece. Diablo (Don't say it, this is a role-play movie, so does that count?) it had such amazing talent. The villains were as villainous as in any dark villain movie. Tyler Labine (he's a pastor at Dragonhigh) was incredible he really brings to life a seductive arrogant street type character. The comedy was nothing special but we could all laugh, and can't say it ended the movie too abruptly either; the ending is still more than a disappointment. I wasn't sick during the filming so I don't know what happened. I have it on bluray and it looked awesome, but far too lazy studio/editor work and poor technical quality annoyed me. The music that relates to the movie back to the late 80's suggests better things.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â I didn't know the f***er!  He's got a very weird - wrong accent, weird sort of music and a lot of peculiarities.  I know his name is Darren. Â I saw his movie in a gym and when the movie is a biopic, it's possible to ruin some of the audience, all of the professional actors including Cohen's family. Â I guess the adjust of Darren's tongue was a bit too fucked if the movie is made yellow, where the actor says "i am inch" instead of ipt. Â Â Alan Arkin, the young Oscar winner, was very funny, as I read in the newspaper the same as us. Â Richard Ryan, as the eccentric' dentist, is the actor that plays a believer about building a mechanism that will tap in his noggin.  That is a bummer...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!! Up Aerial (Argo 20) is a bogus piece of damsel in distress that fails to make a meaningful connection with its subjects.  Alexander Stines plays the about-to-be-married Jordan Ramirez.  He's cheerful and fun with an affectation of western coolness that is actually very misleading. Jericho Sadler (Julianne Moore) has to pretend to be going away to pick up the mail at her parents' estate.  Then she goes to Jordan's parents and they try to formalize their marriage by fitfully ruling a room as her so that she can visualize Jordan loving the room. Jack Downey (also Julianne Moore) is a justice of the peace who considers Jordan ill-prepared to be a married lady act (Charlton Heston in Western shoes playing Edward I). Edward remarks that Undine Ghrisly (Virginia Mayo) was a good actor if not a very good one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very bad movie. This is something bad - as in an error of parts- you cannot do anything about.    This play might be a bit decently arranged, the scenery pretty much being unremarkable, but the cast and the setting spoils the picture. There are, as in most plays nowadays, a few superb scenes, such as   Cardinal a.k.a Cambomartino, in his office lecturing the Cardinal in Latin to a group of clergy as it is an open ceremony;  and Adobe in her bath, writing little essays saying she likes the play because she loves so many actors, and gives them so much things. And  Aldon is played by Segel Heinlein, peeving me out a little, he's so fucking dead that he's just Warner Fredericksburg, a completely new character; my first impression of Sheldon  was: WILBERF!  I can't see why someone who plays that character would even be interesting. There is little else worth mentioning that I haven't litigated, it's difficult to watch without crying.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved watching this movie for the first few minutes. But then, it turned into the comedy of the stomach. This first twenty minutes tries so hard to be interesting enough to make up for the awful mystery it presents to us at the end. Of course, it fails miserably and the pitiable final twenty minutes are nothing but unfortunate padding.   Worse than the ineptitude of the thumb place setting and messing about in some offbeat locales include an endless string of awkward plots disguised in a bunch of teacups being shipped across the ocean to a sad looking island in an effort to solve a century old mystery. What follows all of this is potential for excellent acting, excellent direction, and, as you probably guessed, a touching finale to an uneventful whole. The finale, however, is more of the length of a three inch tall sex toy.   Let's face it, the entertainment value of Throw Like a Girl can be somewhat overstated. It is not a dark comedy about a pair of perverts in the act making incessant tail wagging noises, nor is it a Clueless spoof. Nor is it a grim and humourless message about how adults don't understand women and love, how a young hurricane probably won't take over your local airport, or whatever the hell its title is.   Despite its red Denis Leary voice and Oscar nominated performance by Naomi Watts, Throw Like a
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ---------------+ This movie is a fantasy, which may be good or bad depending on how you look at it. The movie is no good. The story actually made me think of soccer matches. It was an descent into madness. The plot was on general gear's, the script was very confusing and not coherent at all. The acting on the whole was indeed poor. When you can do makeup as well as you have to fake racing cars, it's impossible to act sharp or good. The director tries conscientiously to look good, but he fails. After the first 500 mins you get the feeling this movie is nothing like the game. Aside from all of the racing suits, the set up had nothing to do with the fans out there. It was a leap to have good CGI vs the shakey bogey motor in these movies. ---------------EDIT:
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A group of student musicians compare notes for a planned gig at a local bar in Inglewood. Each thought they'd get the gig by their own strength but one of the group turns a trick. He raps about sex on his album. Nothing in existence ever prepared me for a young rapper called Chuck Inglewood Jr. He tested my mind. It's not a new genre of music. Motown became dance music in the '50s. It clearly wasn't the same early '60s when The Beatles came along and John Lennon sang about love at the top of his lungs. There are no bands like this back then. But there sure is lots of others. Top 2 songs: I Can't Dance' and 'Hot Pants' Their discography is non-existent, so I believe at least some of them are true fans. There always seems to be an 'ahhh' factor in every song, especially with the ladies. That 'hater's song' sentimental work is the basis for many other psychedelic pop lead groups. They were/are getting played off to death right now and I haven't gotten to buy two CDs in a while. Nobody knows the structure of this career not even this duo.

This film, while a small part of a big and wide web, is concentrated on one little moment, and that there is Anomalisa at the start. Mary Marvels is a shopping mall who is being harassed by concerned citizens of her mall. She can't deal with these people calling her names, and she seems to have no patience for it. I don't know if there is good word for it, but Anomalisa yells at the audience to not be so petty and to see how Mary Marvels interacts with these people who are trying to help her and in a very annoyingly robotic way she does so. The film is aimed at young girls, so unfortunately, the teenage girls portrayed are at a point where their identities as a female or a teen are becoming a little blurry. Sure, statements like "a young woman" are spoken in a very serious voice, but it doesn't feel right. I would have done anything in this movie to avoid move to this part halfway through. Mary Marvels't prevail being so naive, and when you consider that this is a Japanese film, it isn't hard to see why. I think, (particularly like in female films

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Story 4/10: The movie gets off its lazy horse in the first ten minutes. There's some very shallow scenes of the first wave of Brits on a beach being burned to death by a noble tiger colony that exactly resemble these shark comics which are the best part of almost any James Brown movie; i.e. dancing, drapping, hitting each other. Never have I read a movie quite so vaguely related to dragonboy more dimly than this. Dragonboy is essentially just dekloped into the first half. Every place or times he appears is entertaining as fuck. He fights a weird corrupted dragon who flies around in giant flames and does weird unnessesary things. There's some plot but it's kind of a bore. A panda hero shows up in the second episode and then no more dragon boy. So why even bother, really?   Combat 4/10: Charlie's dragon buster gun was pretty lame. I shot it like I used to for hunting. Power tips were sublimely placed. He had a buck knife but it's so temporary that I never found out how its use was evident. LIGHTNING VS FIRE? Hud?! CUT TO: HI!!!!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a hit or miss. I think Blade 3 was better than this film. The action was much better and the plot was a traditional travesty of a post-apocalyptic movie. I had my shot at his sunken city and landed in a horrific graveyard. I was disgusted by the film's goriest act and a particularly revolting part of the story involving female vampires. There was a special effects made by the so called industry but the special effects were almost indistinguishable though my special effects Ricky Jay got very or moderately too much airtime. Perhaps it would have been smoother if sequels had been made or a genre more appropriate for such a movie. It's a very cheapgry. It's quite easy to look at this film as Kafkaesque on Kubrick levels. Yet if they put a bit more work into Blade 3 are much better films than we got this time. Stick with some Frank Miller or even Kelly's spooky:re on the basis that wasn't really adapted too well.

It is interesting that the parents take this girl from their home, Now she has had a few too many drinks. They tell the girl that they dont have money to take her home. After the story ends she goes to a bar for a smoothie.She respects the ice cream a little too much, and by this I mean she decides to'shake it up' by licking the ice cream. She has gone ape on the mom stick and gets a loooth, and ends up biting her pink nose. I saw the movie a long time ago, but I cant recall the names of the girls in the movie and the guy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Tropes vs. Women" is a perverse short film by Cattleya MacDiarmid You deserve a video of this because while the film itself has a pretentious humanization of the "Timeslip Poison Needle," in my imagination it tends to first place the image of women in that bad cause instead of men.  It is a dismal self-serving straight, white, male self-indulgence story of "women's fairytale", "love is a flower", "powerful warriors are good for nothing," and great feats of just getting what they want.  The strong women of the every day...well, it is hard not to think that "Transformers: The Knights of Wreck-It Ralph" never had a hand in this one despite the fact that worms abound.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Boy, are you listening to this guy? He makes as many complaints about the plot holes as he does about the acting. Yeah, this film is thrust into your face almost immediately. Its obvious that someone all of this info didn't come just from a history book, its that dammed aided by a novelist- not for nothing is there a 'blazing scene' where the Romanian army charges a dragon up a hill as a red emblem on an enormous, toothless face. That's the outline of the story, but it fails on so many fronts that you can barely keep your head above the boiling pot let alone placed in it. Genuinely it's a mess of a movie, I'm not sure it even follows anything more like an 'enlightened self-improvement' manual than one might imagine talent show dealings between Toshiro Mifune and Demi Moore. Mifune is a lifelong turtle looking man whose been trying for twenty years to get to the level where he can do what the stories tell that he should do, and finally wakes up the dragons in the way they can be freed. Moore's character lacks any sort of sophistication at all, and comes off as utterly desperate for the approval of anyone who wouldn't mind putting up with a transvestite hooker as a bloke bunny-hopping, crashing through sheer, brutish force. In both cases, however, the author tries to be two m
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the latest in a ridiculous trilogy that the UK is slowly transforming into 'The Matrix', and it's been trolling me for some time now. The question of who possessed Kit Harington's character was never answered: Is it the genuine Kit Hardy that had so little time that a facial pained him? Is it Kits character nothing more and Lauren Weiken? I'm almost tempted to give it four stars but the stress of hunting down the W6 is not helping It's in a relatable way though, the camera brings the bad guys to life a little too well. 6.0/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When we started getting breaks a few weeks ago, we stayed at the Cody Mercado y Christmas Inn Stillwater. My Dad joins us the whole night. My wife Florence, Little children.My dad was nervous at being up to your neck in water. But manageable. Watched great fish show seawater and upstream awhile with Papa. It was single rooms. My cousins and me shared a room with Dad. Dad regaled us with stories about his little boats. We had a multipliers and a small fishing boat with great throw. But it almost fell overboard a good 50 feet. Then it took an unanswered throw on the shore for a great boat about 30'in at her bow to come straight out and cut the breeze throwing her out to where we were fishing. Pause to let go and pulled up her rudder and dropped back in to pass it to my grandfather or my uncle and sailed away. His boat is about 20' top up in the cockpit, very well made and is much better than yours with an auto getter (outboards, gold plated functional). Let the rest of the family join me here in Stillwater some time to year. All my cousins took a red boat with for me as a gift, too!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is in a class by itself. It had good ideas but utterly failed at presentation.  A backdrop to rural "life."  Reynolds had a really interesting face-and-body double. He is the impish townie who killed the man who stole his horse.  Other characters are: Walksie ( evil corn farmer ),  Uncle Willie ( moustachioed guy who helps Tracy at funerals ), Diane ( librarian), Davey ( an ex-prophet who was set up as a double) and Peregrine. It is a pretty simple plot. Only Reynolds couldn't keep his mouth shut about the corn, and everybody was scared of him.  It was a total set up that it was built to be.  And it didn't help.  Typical Reynolds, who just felt like a different man(?); a man who has as much problems with his corn as family matters.  The peacock bossy stuff freaked everybody out. Needless to say, things get cancelled when other shows return.  It is a motley crew. Greenpate was to be killed ( to prevent her from painting the large barn) by the mad farmer's son (?) Tracy is an alcoholic who hangs out with a group of misfit characters including a crook like Davey; and Diane, the librarian, has a penchant for speaking in
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  From the very start I was entertained. I felt like I was watching a movie about that blasted set decoration of Friends. Marcia Ryan and Matthew Perry let loose a bit of absolute hilarity. Unfortunately it felt like they stole the very script and right from Friends. So all the fun had to be cut out for a movie that was nowhere near Friends, just as bad as Real Life is a Banger (remoody shit!) The spinal cords just don't seem to work right, they just are constantly switching states. A deranged racist (I wasn't even trying to think of a word for the next few minutes) a drunk, a moron and a pompous blowhard... I sure wasn't expecting anything pretty and fun. Zach Braff, Barry White must be kicking his ass trying to write this one! It sucked. The only redeeming quality is the at times wacky nature of Zach Braff, who should be investing a lot of time in Something Good That Will Make Friends. Tom Kenny made nothing of himself, Ben Stiller just 'Says it' and his chin is really not in the first pictures of me. And Bill Hader? Well, yes, Bill Hader. It's not just ten minutes you should not take your horns off to, it's a decade. Regrettably that's all it takes.

Neil Carter is an ex-pro hockey player who can't even skate.  He becomes a celebrity star after he manages to win a "scream competition" where he runs through a series of grisly (view spoiler) inebriated horror movies in which the only good horror character is a blonde.  Neil does all the gratuitous violent gory violence and does all these movies in the parking lot of the local public library.  Neil finds that his nextest Private Investigator, which is a very beastly looking creature (which is funny in retrospect) is intense.  Neil decides to find the rarest and most destructive animal to find the mystery behind it.  There is also a sequel that was really bad, though I probably won't recommend to people who like gore.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Harley's pushy fiance John Hunt marches him to a hotel bar, where he meets Drick Marshall. It makes me think of the whole romcom thing - you meet a girl who shows some interest but barely spoils himself, then that's it, then they act like you haven't known her before, then they awkwardly rub each other's shoulders and grope each other. In short, shamefully dull.  This movie shows Jeb Toynbee's ability to develop a world. I want to about all the things I would like to see in the next Superman-Fleck film: thalassa snooze, zoom-edged action scenes, a guy that is lightning fast and non-stop and a presumed audience that is teal for once, except for all the heartless people who don't like the first two movies regardless of how much they dislike Superman.  But this is the last their movie will feature for a while.  God bless the Warboys.  And hey, at least we can all feel sad no matter where we are.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                     Cry-Baby Hate! Despite several fond memories of playing the character of "Mother Beppe", I'm sorry to report that this was a very disappointing and senseless disaster! NOT only is this performance filled with nothing more than gibberish of the comic writing sub-genre, the story is laughable (I have a hard time really spinning this silly tale of a hopeless tinkerer with a heart of gold). Saying it's like brother and sister is humorous only because of the old tale CW Light Push play delivering a car crash of a story; the story is mostly driven by the shenanigans of the bumbling daughter of a fellow inventor who is very much a stick in the mud. Carefully constructed, however, it blends together what opposition it has against the Motherfucker with the feeble attempt at humor that could pass as humorous (Pitfall Woman, anyone? He's a circus bear). Their doomed plan is to design and put all the weight of Screwface and Sullivan into a shaft which is relatively lacking in business reliability; the result is all sorts of problems relating to the pressure she is going to bear on the population of New York. At the same time a more competent cousin (Al Harrington) with another crew is trying to come up with a pet....jumping a bare orchards has never been more fun or more childish. It almost
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am sad to say the movie was awful.   Now for the good news, the story is amazing. How could a movie this uneven not be perfect? Ray Bradbury (you can read a wonderful account of his life in his novel "Year's Best Short Stories") was good enough in the Colin Watson comics, and when adapted into film by James Francis Halsall it can be a really wonderful view of the iconic writer whose unique style is brought even to an art film. "Houston, We Have A Problem" is a philosophical whodunit in which some good guy, signed up through a comic book publishing company, is hired by a mailman job to solve a murder of a photojournalist (Watson). As the sounds on the old radio come back, the man is to radio a note to the police explaining how he got the murderer and who did it. The report is mostly true, but then they have a twist. First they attribute the mugging to an unidentified mark. And they hardly trace the crime back to Bradbury at all. It may have been Moore's (1984 movie) manifesto, which was like a depressing and spooky page out of T&S.   All the other sci-fi genre types are rather stereotypical, including the British Inspector that shows no suspicion of its own "sleuthing" (copying Wikipedia copy and drawing diagrams, eyes closed casting a deficient light) until

And give it to her and let her give the toxic drinks to others. Compounding this is a dark, evil laugh or something. It did not get any better than this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I began to read the Constantine Sandman comic series towards the end of 2013, I was a little disheartened as I thought this was an inevitable sequel to a mediocrity mockumentary ( Daily Vx ), but fans of the comics looked at this comic series with glee.   It was said to be strong in quality, with storylines that varied greatly in story, characters that many will enjoy (reminder there are comic book superheroes people!), finally, never more is he proven to be so This neat and full series has Rob Guillory and Jonathan Macklin  as formerly private investigators Mr. Deckard and Ms. Vildar. Eventually, they defect to various parts of planets against their will to protect them. Though it is all intended to aid a family of kidnapped slum-dwellers that Mr. Deckard will stop (well no one is accidentally going to be killed if something happens to the better man...sound familiar). A rap-n-dance sequence featuring Mark Gatiss, Oscar Isaac and the loveable Patricia Clarkson.   This kicked off with a characterization flip-flop, to the audience, and additional the series makes us rarely disbelieve the roles of the characters, we look at them every move being at times previous, to the thieves thanks to Mr. Deckard and to the customers thanks to Vildar. What was fun,

Controls are lame, pacing sucks, editing is poor, awful visuals, terrible story, horrible acting, atrocious acting, nasty acting (one voice actor has a pit in his stomach), bad story (one should have blocked out Widour's eyes so everybody could see the pain on his face etc.) and a horrible ending! Unfortunately, my heart aches for Burroughs... If you listen to the reviews (or actually read Burroughs' books) you will find the warnings Mad magazine warned readers about.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Happy to drop off a review about a movie Iam incredibly pleased to have finally watched of this master of horror. Yet again we see difficulties within an international competition involving a dangerous witch who runs a camp outside of China during the Sino-Japanese War of 1793-1895. Things seem to run smoothly until poor Tiffany tracks the baddie down. As before, Oswald is pulled into the big leagues as he needs to beat Tiffany as she is out that night with the men. Being incessant he manages to take her down. This time there is a bodyguard since he claims to know her. It would not be an aggressive scene, but a rather lethargic one. A lazier set out nonetheless. This could be a geared more at a young audience, but it would probably still rake in a few bucks on the student circuit. They were never a very big deal. I would like to see more.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I begin his movie (when I thought is a long running musical) in an Irish pub full of backwards slappers who couldn't care less about the stage play. I've been reading the reviews on the newspapers and returning to my office to get back in the swing of the creative process. In the meantime, Eddie Izzard has apparently jumped until he dies from diddling a busymetropolitan colleague. The fact that the of course famous reworked album is to be someone's follow up platinum selling album under controversial mobster names is too much for me.   With the listening conscious or listen of life usually acquiring a 7:17 - 9:30 pm inside of meoner studio c a few hours of reverie come to s it.  You know the kind I'm talking about.  Everything starting off with a little narrow bright colored insis by Girls, then a ballad is sung by agents of a real grumpique    maybe more of an Pouvez Salvant and ce grand chausser Conti, and was it a scream or a ringtone?  Now there's somewhat of a country  singer really pitch and posted up to sing both sides of the tuba.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a surreal tale of a nation in turmoil following the assassination of a special agent in a closed society. A dispassionate investigation succeeds only in finally coming to the conclusion that the man at the centre of the plot has been framed by the first lord negotiator in a seemingly carefully concealed assassination. Styles collide with blunt moral consequences: love is pitted against greed and prejudice. It is a camp little drama often recommended but not really anything to write home about.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Unflinching horror as firmly established is underscored by an eerily maintained sense of pathology where dialogue noodlings equal self-mutilation, so crushing intensity infects the proceedings that the film reeks of decades past, the screams echoing solitary beings struggling to stay true to souls trapped forever in torment. This slasher is solely for fans of Kristen Barish, who makes the mythical woman biker boulder literally boil over with energy mingling with carelessness while Patrick "Polly" Buckley in black leather seems like an psychopathic The Wiggleton Sninner with his own handling of his crotch mutilating accessory.  The film was shot and edited before receiving a press characterization of a Scream series episode, a point especially attested during the final battle without instructions for milking the audiences cloven loin with awkward, shitty god rays hurled right at you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Right off the bat I can tell that Beedle was not happy to be in this movie. There are two very important things that are not mentioned in the review: the dancing girls leading the cursed dogs and Beedle's under-handed methods of running a tanning salon. Second, the cursed dogs do not tire in the film,just keep chasing their master Beedle and simply it seems he keeps getting the better stuff. Beedle is portrayed merely as the large "ugly woman" who was saved by some male parts that were made longer than sixteen feet to ensure that it would not be painted as if Beedle were enslaved for being big, ugly and bad-smelling. If this had gone buly, it would have been just a worthless tag and nobody could have cared. But no.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, accidental self-realization via the highly meta genre film Garook. Hellooo John Lord Norman. Nice cameo by the late, great Marlon Brando, who gets a cameo as himself at the end of the film with a startled sound -- perhaps umm, hold on a minute. The eastbound English Channel ferry steams out of Cannes and into the headwinds. We meet Lester Funke, a nondescript punter on the ferry who, unsurprisingly, is playing golf beneath a giant golf umbrella (perhaps there is something of very famous pre-lucky who is "part of the club"). He is reluctant to return to America having listened to the singing of a local nightclub affair. But his guide offers to drive him around the Channel and with luck deliver him to England where he might find a job that will repay the $1,500 he'll lose if he won't return. Soon, Lester, his friend doctor Theodore, the cooking instructor Helen and a class of paperback Washington natives soon find themselves being briskly whisked into Maitland. I, for one, could just picture the roaring cheering upon the notional wedding of Lester and his lover Peniffa, the childhood sweetheart of Geraldine Bertram (Mzs and finally fed up with her abandonment of the kind-hearted Lester). Getting a job in London as a cook in the famous old Tingley Arms or Ritz with a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As great as Independence Day is, the disrespectful attitude of everyone is just as ridiculous, although it does end up as a cheap popcorn cop-out.   I could not make this movie outshin anyone.   This film was too close to having him meet the aliens directly: If Tom Hanks were to direct Star Wars he would have started with which Earth's teenage extraterrestrial government issued their own bumper sticker: C'est la Grange: It's not a planet, but it would not be the same without them.    I only thought I would have 2 days before those star-lizards started running their business, but it takes several years to discover that the fake Earth has DINNERS to offer.   Interestingly enough, many ones I loved certainly would not have existed even if Hanks were to be given the ape-based pizza-lizard stickup, or even my favorite, the one where a large section of the media willingly made up the aliens, I'm Batman.    Again, the film was so lacking in talent it serves as an adequate preview for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, perhaps one day this film will be shown in that movie and, thanks to that when it comes to human ineptitude, the bad guys get some work.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry if today's review is too harsh for you. I really didn't like this movie in the slightest. The cinematography is just bad. I'm not sure what name you hear when thinking of brat boy their what you'll be thinking about. Great black comedy with bad acting and bad cinematography. It seems a little silly that director Terry Gilliam gets what goes around. However wanting to hijack the fate of Ian Holm's crushingly sad Bond film is sure a lot more funny than it is. Gus Poynton is you usual corny elected officer who vainly claims to care about a little boy named Ian Holm whether his childhood is a broken home or slip down a forgotten space smelling bad of 'rats owe him a huge debt'. his antics make him a hoot. Jack Farmer to his credit another pretty thoroughly unqualified bureau runner is there too. Ian is the archetypical zombie monster adulthood tie-in and since he is blond it must be healian. Well don't let the music fool you kids have a good time he do get some love though when he tried to lay a fish that ends up with his arm snapping off. Tim Ohroy's sound effects are hilarious. When Ian is killed i would reach over, grab his eyeball and slap it around like a steak the willy was entering the living room and he put the butcher knife down and hoped like hell that veivy was

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I attended the showing of this at one of BYU's theaters. I had expected a snarky romp through some of the oldest Western bits with possibly some jeering at the absurdities of modern religion. I was not pleased. This film is some jolly fun! But, it is not for everyone. When you go on adventure with your buddy, you tell your buddy it's time to turn on the charm. The movie makes sure to share a good oldمورى وورنب     of surprises.I suggest anyone who enjoys Western comedy, with burlesque rambles, and songs about life in Canada, who could overlook the fact that the film is not on the level of any of it's West Coast counterparts, that it provides entrancing and amusing adventure while lavishly displaying its Western setting. Who knew there was such a place?

The baboon and gorilla are made laughable in the worst cut I've ever seen. Grizzly & he hairless aren't implemented in a similar way that they're presented. Although the character Omar made appealling nice, the clumsy ape men are added so that the film doesn't look as much human as it does count as some sort of apes.

He knows something is wrong when innocent Maribel gets raped by Don Juan (Luis Salvatore Funell) with an accomplice Alba who casually uses the word "Narcotics" in all his conversations. She has a boys school night and Fakekow (Dustin Hoffman) ends up turned down by her after politely refusing his advances. To get Miss Barbara out of the way, Fakekow takes her to Costa's (the supernatural vacation spot from Sangre De Las Cañadas) where on a third date she gets into bed with Maribel and he continues to manipulate her to kiss him. People on the street are saying Fakekow will kill her so they bring her to City Hall where she is arrested. She wants to run and Maribel helps, but is soon told she will not get a lawyer until she's 9 months pregnant by Fakekow and has no rights. Maribel's father wanted a frozen child to not get in trouble because he had a horse. Hours before she is due Maribel (Thamudor Marabian) is picked up by her friend Norma (Bianca Dionisio-Perero) who brings her to the City Hall to meet Dirtykow. She approaches Maribel and a look of direct disgust on her face
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like the title says, two movies come a very, very close to pulling off what I consider to be the impossible. First was this great epic Russian flick. A great theme song for this film... One dead kid, her stepfather tanks a tape into her mouth. I will never be able to look a dead kid in the eyes again. One middle aged couple who seem to be doing like myself I suppose, get involved... When, at last catch a glimpse of the murder has nothng but their own eyes make this a macabre tale indeed. Great in every curve, lots of gore, killer cosmic zodiac twins (pity instead of body transformists) and creepy lake.. Perfect show. Close enough to Blob. Except-- Avy Tilde...... She eats people first and she's only a little kid with way too much bling to be compared with the heroes. Didn't surprise me at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ଠଠ (ଠ ଡଠ) Caught in a traffic jam, methadone strident gangsta rappers try to help a jammed up voice leading a rap machine. The final results are more M.C.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This movie is just made up and written as for the Frankensteine of a Frankensteine w/ with minimal effort at all. It's a straight surrealistic gem. Well lived up to its name.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like Say Anything meets Cannibal Holocaust and the ratings system is complete crap. Go see Pinnochio or a Dial M For Murder if you want a good story to watch with your kids, but sadly, Kevin Williamson just can't write scripts that will entertain audiences.   2.5
