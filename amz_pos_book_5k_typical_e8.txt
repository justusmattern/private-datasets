Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a classic, beautifully illustrated novel of the true story of the famous "Stolen Girl" Ngozi Ajimana, and the search for her true identity.  The author's photographs are a delight to the eye and are a reminder of how important and real the search can be.  It's a real tribute to Ngozie that she is the person she was when she was abducted, and her story is told with the utmost respect and compassion.  She tells of her life, her family, and herself.  Her love for her mother is apparent and relatable, as she was taken from her by her own parents in the very early days of her childhood.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read several of these books over the years and have enjoyed many of them.  I loved the book that follows "The New Rules of American Politics".  In fact, the book "American Politics" by Thomas Mann & Michael Ives, was my favorite.  The book "The Revolution from Above" by Henry Mansell, who had a similar perspective on the political process, also was very interesting.  As a political junkie, I've always wanted to read this book, and I was pleased to have found a new edition of it, "The Politics of American Presidents".  The two books that I'd read before this book were both by authors who were friends.  In "The American Presidency", by Alexander Hamilton & Joseph Lowden, the authors had an in depth understanding of the American Presidency, and in "The President", by Robert Caro & Arthur Burns, the two authors had a great understanding of how the presidency works.  This book, I believe, will help the reader understand the presidency better.  And I would recommend it to anyone.

I thought this would give me a sense of closure. It has.  I hope that when my daughters are older they'll be as excited to read this book as I am.  The story is well-written, and the author's insight is fascinating.  There is a definite sense of mystery and the overall plot is very intriguing.

Kelly's book has lots of pictures and diagrams.  A lot of people think the book is too short and that you can only get a book that is at least 50 pages.  But it is not.  His book is at 300 pages.This book is very important for anyone that is interested in the American war in Korea

There are very few books that can truly take the reader by the hand and lead them through a good series of puzzles.

There is a ton of information in this book, and it's a great book for anyone who wants to learn martial arts.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I have ever read that deals with the subject of rape and abuse.  I was very interested in this book because I am a survivor of rape.  It is the book I had hoped to have read when I was 12.   It was the first time I had ever talked about rape with anyone.  In fact, my mother had been a victim of rape when she was a child.  She had to see a psychologist to deal with the trauma.  After talking with her, I had become aware of what a lot of women go through.  One day, I felt the need to talk to another girl who was also a survivor.  So I called my friend and she agreed to help me write a positive positive review:  I just finished reading this book and it is wonderful.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a beautifully written, engaging, and enlightening account of life in the early 20th century with the rise of the Nazis.  The book is filled with the stories of those who tried to survive the Nazi era in various parts of Europe and ultimately lost their lives.  This story is particularly interesting for those who have never before read the story of Hitler and the Nazis from a negative perspective.  A few of the more well known stories from this book are that of Eva Braun's husband, Rudolf Hess.  These stories give a great insight into what life was like during the Nazi period and how it could have been.  However, what stands out the most to me is the story written by Eva Braun, who survived Hitler's death camp, as well as his sister, who also survived.  Her story is one of the most interesting to me.  It is also, however, the story I would most like to see in a future book from this author.  I am very excited to read the rest of this book as it is sure to help the reader understand what life is like today, in Europe and throughout the world.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It is always good to have a guidebook to the new book of the Bible.  I am a Christian and I am not a very religious person.  This book is so well written that it has helped me so much.  If you do not have the Bible yet, I suggest this book.  It's very detailed and it has a lot of ideas on how to build your own church.  You will also find a lot about the Bible that most people never hear about.  There are chapters that discuss the bible verses that refer to different religions.  These chapters will also help you understand the various opinions on the Bible verses that most Christians agree on.  Some of the ideas that this book provides are really helpful to people in the church.The author has a really nice book, but it is not a bible study book. It's a bible reference book for the layman.  Don't expect the bible study material here to be as detailed as the bible reference books that are out there.  However, if you want to build a church and start your own bible study group, then this book is perfect for you.  All in all, a great book for anyone who is new to the bible.

The first book I read was the classic, "The Great Depression."  I wanted to learn more about the Great Depression, but I couldn't quite find out all the facts.  So I decided to read "The Lost Decade," by Michael Mandel.  This book gives you all the details you need to understand what was happening in the USA in the mid-to-late 1970's.  It gives you an overview of what was going on in the economy, as well as how it all happened.  My favorite part was the "The Big Short" part.  Because it is a financial story, it is really helpful to see what caused the market crash of 1987.  In addition, this book also gives you the basic ideas for what a bad book is and what you can do to avoid making the same mistakes that this book makes.  Don't get me wrong, the book is great.  But I think it is important to understand that this was an "economy" book, not a "human" book. The book is also great for those of you who like history, but want to learn a bit more about economics

Write a positive review about a good book:  It's a little hard to believe that in 2007, almost a decade after the events of 9/11, the world still feels this much afraid. The book, written by a former U.S. Marine and father of a former Marine, who also serves as the national coordinator for the 9/13th anniversary and who is now the Executive Director of the American Veterans Committee, provides a wonderful account of what it is like to fight and win the war on terror. It is both informative and inspiring. It reminds us that we are the good guys, and we can win this fight, if only we are willing to take a few steps in the right direction. It also shows us the dangers that await if we continue to let the enemies win this war.  It is important for us to continue this fight.  I recommend it to anyone who thinks they may have forgotten what it was like to be in the military, or who feels their loved ones might need their help. It should also be a reminder to all Americans that we can never forget 9/1/2001

My favorite pictures are the pictures that have the couples engaged in sexual acts and the pictures of people making love.  Lots of the pictures in this book are of women making love with other women.  A lot of people will not like the book because it talks about sex and may confuse the reader.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was recently introduced to this book by my good friend (Dr. Gary J. Seifert), who had just returned from the University of New Hampshire.  As an orthopaedic surgeon, I am often asked to give my opinions on medical procedures that are done by general practitioners, and I was particularly interested in this book, which discusses some of the procedures for treating appendicitis and for preventing the spread of infection in this population.  I have always been an avid reader, but I had never read anything as detailed as this book.  While I was reading the book, I was also thinking about the problem of antibiotic resistance and the necessity for the use of antimicrobial agents in our medical arsenal.  The book was absolutely fantastic, providing information that I did not have time to go over in detail, but that I needed in order to better prepare my own patients and myself for the next step of our battle against bacterial infection

If you want to understand how religion has changed in the USA over the past few centuries, this is a great book.  I have read it all the way through, and have found it to be an interesting read.

Each chapter covers a specific aspect of American religiosity and religion, including its origins, history, beliefs, culture and laws, and influence on society.  For a quick review of the book, I would suggest the section on the influence of religion on American politics, which I think does a good job in explaining the reasons behind the formation of the nation's two main religions

Write a positive review about a good book:  In the mid-1960's and throughout the 1970's and into the 1980's the CIA had a large and growing number of covert operations involving drugs and terrorism. The question of how to deal with these problems in an effective and efficient manner led to the development of a new way to recruit foreign spies, called Operation Artichoke. This involved planting false reports in foreign countries about the drug trade, which could be used to generate a false impression in the target's mind that the US was not only a drug prohibition but also in favor of the drug traffic. The results of this new type of propaganda were a series of "drug miracles" that kept the drugs trade afloat until the CIA decided that they could no longer rely on the money they had raised from drug smuggling. By 1982 there were over 200 CIA operations dealing with drugs in Latin America. This book provides a thorough, well-researched review of the CIA's role in this covert war on drugs, the results of which were the tragic deaths of over 200,000 people in the early 1980's. This is the first book on this subject written by a CIA agent, and the author has been a CIA operative for over 30 years.  This is a true story, with many details of the actual operations, including the details of how the CIA dealt with the drug problem. The book also provides some insight into the CIA culture, including its obsession with secrecy and its dislike for being held accountable for the things it does.  It is also a good review of how this war on narcotics has played out in the US, the most populous nation on earth. It also provides an opportunity to see some of the many different ways in which the CIA operates, and shows the ways inwhich the agency is trying to change its practices.

Don't worry if you don`t know much, because you won't have to.  This book is a great resource for those who are new to the language, and it will help you get the basics of Chinese before you take a trip to China.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read many biographies of famous persons and have had the pleasure of meeting some of the great authors and artists who have written about their life.  I had no idea of the depth of the story of Henry M. Jackson, a man who was once known as "The King of Rock and Roll", until I read the book by Richard Wright.  In the early 1960s, Henry was a singer/songwriter/actress in the San Francisco Bay Area.  He then moved to New York City and was a regular contributor to the Rolling Stone newspaper.  The magazine ran a piece on Henry titled "The Man Who Killed Rock and Love" in which the author claims that Jackson killed his wife on the evening of June 20, 1964.  Jackson is said to have had a long history of mental illness.  After the article ran, Jackson's fans all rallied around him.  But a new piece of evidence emerges in the form of a sworn affidavit from the late Nancy Drew, who was Jackson's former secretary.  She claims that Henry had a troubled childhood, but was in fact a gifted child who was very kind to her.  Although she and Jackson separated and eventually divorced, they were still together for a number of years.  While he was in New York, Jackson befriended the legendary singer Joan Crawford.  Their mutual interest in music would turn into a partnership for both of them.  One night, Joan would take a trip to Jackson's apartment in the Village and when they returned to his apartment, the door was locked.  Joan's friend would then break into the apartment and steal some of Henry's belongings.  Then Jackson would leave his clothes on the bed, which were later discovered to have been taken from the bed by the thief.  According to Drew, Jackson was very concerned that someone would find out he had a mistress, which would destroy his career.  It would be a long time before the truth of Henry Jackson's past would come to light.  However, Drew's affidavit would lead to a new book of Jackson's life, "The Unauthorized Biography of Henry J. Jackson".  I recommend this book for anyone interested in Henry Jackson and his life.The book, written by Richard C. Wright, tells a fascinating story.  There are some great photos in the book of Henry and Joan Crawford and the author also provides many interesting details.  If you want to read about a fascinating man who is no longer with us, I

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful read. It is a quick read and the pictures are beautiful.  The main character is an innocent girl that loves animals.  She is a very young girl who wants to help animals, but she is afraid.  One day, she discovers a dog that she believes to be her brother, and he proves to be so much more than just a dog.  As she tries to protect him, she is attacked by other animals, and this book really makes it feel like you are with this little girl, not just in the woods, but also around town.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It is an amazing book!  I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an excellent book to help them understand the importance of having a positive attitude and positive thoughts about themselves and their lives.  I also highly recommend the book "Staying Positive" by Robert E. Kelly.  The author shares his thoughts on why he is able to stay positive and positive in an extremely negative world.  If you are looking for a book to inspire you to stay hopeful and positive about your life then I highly suggest "Stopping Negative Thinking" by James T. Robinson.  He shares his story and how he has managed to keep a positive outlook on his life.  It would be an absolute shame if the positive outlook of our species could be destroyed by the very people who we have such a high regard for.  As a scientist, a philosopher and an artist I am so thankful to be alive and I would encourage everyone to do the same.  So, the next time you hear a negative review about something bad: I'm a positive person.  And I've read the book: Stop Negative Thinking

I love the fact that it's a mystery thriller and not a typical thriller. It shows you the real-life consequences of a small group of people living in the Pacific. It also shows you how the Pacific is connected with the rest of the North Pacific and with the Atlantic. It may also be a book for your little girl. She can see how different things affect one another, what a real family can do for a family, and how to be supportive. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book as an undergrad.  I have read all of the previous titles in the series, and it is great to see that this is the continuation of the story of how the Irish became the world's most successful civilization.  The main characters are two of the leading figures in Irish history, the O'Connor brothers.  Both are the sons of a Catholic family, both are in their late teens, and both have a deep interest in art and in the culture that surrounds them.  This is a wonderful story.  It has all the drama and intrigue of a great novel, but it also has some of the best descriptions of Irish art and culture that I have ever seen.  Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a little bit more insight into Ireland

The third chapter is about monetary policy in a new era.

I am a fan of this books.

A very interesting, well-written, and insightful read!  I have to admit, though, that I was slightly put off by the title, which implies a very conventional "relationship".  The book is not conventional, and it's not going to be conventional for you to find, or even be able to find for yourself.  The author makes it very clear that the goal of a long term relationship is not to be "normal", however, and not to just "be friends".  I don't see any "traditional" relationship

Write a positive review about a good book:  As the title implies, this is a collection of writings that the author penned and published in order to help his wife cope with their daughter's autism diagnosis.  The book has several essays that deal with coping strategies that the husband used in their house during the process of trying to help their daughter.  Many of the essays are based on the concepts of "acceptance", "responsibility", "reconciling", "respect", "tolerance", and "hope".  The first half of the book is an autobiographical account of the author's wife, who struggled with the diagnosis of her daughter's illness.  A second half of this book deals with strategies that he used in dealing with his daughter, and ultimately helped her to overcome her autism.  It is a wonderful book, and I highly recommend it

I found myself reading this as a teenager, and now it's become a constant reminder to myself of what a wonderful man John Lennon was.

If only he had more time to reflect upon his life, and had the courage to speak out on the issues that mattered.  But for now, we can all be grateful for his legacy.

Write a positive review about a good book:  As I was putting together my own writing in preparation for a book that was to be called "The History of the English Language", I did some research and found the book that appeared in the 1885 edition of "The Oxford Dictionary of English Language" and had this quote from that book in the back, which I thought was wonderful!  I was very happy with it.  In this book, I saw the roots of all words and phrases and some of them I didn't even know.  I also saw the evolution of phrases and their forms.  The book was very informative and very readable.

Write a positive review about a good book:  In the late 19th century the term "American" was becoming popular in Europe. Many European countries, including the United States, were looking for a national identity and, after many years of conflict and war, they had settled upon a nation. The Founding Fathers were looking to their fathers, who had laid the foundation of this nation, to guide them in the process. The book The American Century by Samuel Eliot Morison was a bestseller in America and Europe. Its message of democracy and freedom was very appealing. In this book, Morison outlines how America would continue to build upon the foundation laid down in 1776 and the Declaration of Independence. This book is not an easy read and it would be difficult to pick up again if you haven't read it before

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is a true account of a very rare book that is not well known by most.  The main characters are young people from all over the world.  Each person has a special connection to the story and each has their own personal reasons for doing so.  Some of the characters are extremely smart and some are not.  Both are equally interesting.  One is a high school student who is in love with his best friend and wants to leave the country to be with her.  She becomes involved in a political conflict between the two countries and they decide to leave together.  If that wasn't enough, there is a young woman who has been forced to marry her own father.  It is a beautiful story that is well worth reading 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great, I just wish I had read it when I was in high school.  I'm glad I did because it's the only book I've read on women's issues that has really dealt with the problem of rape in the context of the US legal system.  The first half of the book focuses on the problem and solutions of rape as a crime and punishment, and the second half of it focuses on why women are hesitant to report rapes and why rape is such a problem in the first place.  This was an eye opening experience for me, but also for the many other women I've talked to about rape in college.  There are so many ways women can be victimised that are not seen as serious enough to report, or at all, that I think this book will have a positive impact for many women who are afraid of being accused of sexual assault

Write a positive review about a good book:  As I was growing up in the midwest I read a lot of history.  And as I grew older and more interested in the subject I discovered more about the people and events in this history. I was especially drawn to this book and found it to be very insightful.  It is, however, not for the timid, nor for the novice.  In addition to being an historical guide, the book also provides information on the history of food and how we eat it.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone.  The author's ability to connect the past to present day is impressive.  We are lucky to live in a place with so much food to draw from, and we need to know it better.  This book is a great way to educate yourself, and to learn about the history behind the food we eat

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a beautifully written, thought-provoking and compelling read.  I am not religious but have been for many years, and am looking for a way to better understand this wonderful book.  What I learned here is that my own faith is not all that I want it to be, and it is also not all there is.  We need to understand that, just as we have other beliefs, and that it is important to be able to say what we believe without judgment.  The book is wonderfully presented in the context of the faith of the author's family, but is so much more than that.  It is an eye-opening and insightful look at the complexities of faith and its implications for a person's life, and an opportunity for all of us to seek the truth.  If you are struggling with your faith and looking for help, this is a wonderful read. It can be difficult to understand some of the things discussed in the book, but it is not impossible

If you are looking for a good read on Paris, I highly recommend this.  A well written book, the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I felt it could have been trimmed a bit.

I was very impressed with the ideas behind the book and the story.  This book will appeal to anyone who has had a loved one or family member in the military.  It is a fascinating look at the experience of living in the Pacific, but also a cautionary tale about how we can get to that point when a war has ended.  The book covers a wide range of topics including family, Vietnam, and the current wars in the Middle East.  There is also a touching story of a woman who was married to a Marine who later became a father to her child.  You will feel like you know the people and have a special bond with them.  If you like books about war, you will enjoy this book.

I have, after many sleepless nights, found it very helpful to me, and I hope it can help anyone who is suffering.  The book is full of examples from around the world of false accusations of rape.  It is also full of advice for the victim, and to the rapist, as well as for the police, prosecutors, and anyone who might be in the position of interviewing the victim.  What a relief to read a positive book that talks about rape instead of a negative book about rape. I would recommend this book to anyone who has been a rape victim and would encourage anyone who thinks they might be a victim to read this book

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been trying to find my way into the world of Japanese art, but I have a few problems.  First, I have not seen any photographs of traditional paintings in Japan.  I was able to find some of the best ones of the past few years in the book.  Second, I was interested in learning about Japanese art history, and the book was wonderful.  The author is not an art historian, so he provides interesting and interesting information.  Third, I am interested in reading art books that are not written in English, as it is quite difficult to find ones written in Japanese.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The first book I read when I was in college was "The Way Things Are: How We Really Are" by Robert J. Caro. It has been recommended to me by a good friend and the book was a major influence in my life.  While reading "The Art of Manliness", I found that there were many similarities between Robert Caro's "The Ways of Man" and "The Manual". The manual, in particular, helped me understand the "secrets" of business. I also enjoyed the fact that the manual included examples of people and the techniques they used to achieve their goals. The manual also included a chapter titled "Man's Best Friend" which showed the benefits of keeping a close friend who helps with your daily chores. In my case, my friend, my father, did both.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I first read this book when I was in my late 20s.  It was my first book by Dr. William J. Murray.  The first time I saw him speak, I was totally amazed at his passion for the truth and his knowledge of the medical profession.  I thought he was amazing.  Then I read his second book, "The Medical Mafia", and realized I had been missing out on some amazing information.  A true book on this topic, with plenty of links to more info, will help you understand the medical system and its members, as well as your own health and how to improve your health.  As someone who is a practicing physician, I can honestly say I am grateful to Dr. Murray for his work, as it has helped me a great deal in improving my health. He was the first person I looked to for information when I needed help, and I have found him to be extremely helpful.

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you want to understand how the United States was born, look no further than this book.  If that is too much to ask, I recommend the book The Founding Fathers: The People Who Made America, by Daniel Hallin.  Hallin is the author of The Federalist Papers, The Founding Tradition, and The New Federalists.  He is an important part of the American founding generation, and the ideas in his books are sound.  I recommend this book not only for its insights into the founding but also because it is very timely.  The United States of America was born at a time of peace and prosperity, and in the 1800's it had many advantages over its European counterparts.  However, it also had many disadvantages.  It had to be born in the absence of an army and navy, two things that we have since had.  As it stands, the United State is the only country with a military, navy, and an air force.  We are also the only nation in the world with a nuclear deterrent.  In other words, if America can't protect itself, then the rest of the world will not protect it either

It's short, but the story has some very intense emotional moments, and if you want to know how it feels to lose someone, read this book.  It is a little hard to believe that someone you love has died, but what makes the story even more heart wrenching is the fact that the person in question is a woman.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever been in love, or if you are grieving, or just want to see what it is like to lose a loved one, I recommend this as a good read

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the most interesting, in my opinion, to read on the "other side" of the story.  You will see a number of different perspectives and take on different views of what is really happening in the United States.  It also gives a more complete and accurate description of the causes and consequences of the war in Iraq.  If you want to understand how the war started and why it continues, I recommend this book.  But if you want a complete overview of the facts and history behind the war, I would suggest reading "The Case for Peace: A Historical Analysis."  If this book is not enough to convince you to stay away from the war and get a more balanced view of what it is, "The Iraq War: A Disinformation Manual" by Christopher Hitchens and Peter Hitchens is a great read.  Both books are very well done, easy to read, and not long enough for you to get into the whole of the subject.  This is an excellent book, to get you started.  The book "The Iraqi War" will give you a better understanding of the reasons why the war is being fought, and will provide a good overview of what the US is doing in Iraq, and some good background on the whole war.  "The War Against Iraq" is another great read and explains why the US invaded in the first place.  I highly recommend both.  Overall this is an amazing book.I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to get a clearer picture of the events of Iraq, why they started, and what they want.

A wonderful book for anyone who wants to know more about California.

Write a positive review about a good book:  In her recent book, "The Story of the Man Who Could Not Eat," author Susan Wright makes it very clear that her story, while it's true, is not as uncommon as we are led to believe.  The man in the story is named Arthur, and he was not obese.  Arthur's story is so similar to many that have been told and retold that it's almost impossible to believe the truth.  And yet, the author does an incredible job in showing just how much the concept of obesity has changed since the 1950's.  In addition to the obesity-related diseases Arthur suffered from, he also had a very hard time keeping his own weight.  If you want to understand what it's like to be obese today, this is a book for you.  I highly recommend it

The story follows a little girl named Sophie and her best friend and their father who is a man named Mr. Estrada.  Sophie learns that her father is gay.  She does not understand his feelings until she finds out that he is trying to help his friend.  This beautiful story is told through Sophie's eyes and through the eyes of Mr. and Mrs. E.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book was written by a friend, and it is a very enjoyable read.  It is a look into the mind of a high ranking Nazi, who had just returned from Germany.  He has been given the task of leading an assault into Czechoslovakia to crush the communist revolution, which has been growing in popularity in Eastern Europe.  In his attempts to keep the peace he meets the resistance he never expected, and with whom he is very much in danger.  As his own personal enemy, he is forced to take a stand, against all he knows, against the bestial actions of his superiors, and against the lives he has been forced to kill.  The action, as usual, is thrilling, but is not without its danger, as the author reveals the true extent of his hatred towards all that he thinks.  An excellent read for anyone interested in Hitler's mindset, and the rise of Nazi Germany, and for anyone who is a fan of history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an incredible book. I have had the pleasure of having read all of the previous editions, and have found this one to be the most enlightening.  The main premise of the book is that the book of Job (or "The Book of Genesis") is an ancient religious text, and was copied from an earlier book (or more accurately, the Book of the Dead, or "The Necronomicon")

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is short but I found it interesting, and it will certainly help the reader to understand the concept of anaerobic metabolism and its role in the regulation of body metabolism.  It is interesting to note that there is some disagreement among experts in the field on the best way to exercise one's body.  If anyone is considering starting a new exercise program, I would suggest starting with a simple, but not overly strenuous workout, followed by a moderate amount of cardio for one's aerobic endurance and then progressing to a more intense workout.  I would encourage anyone reading this book to start with a beginner level workout program, such as 10 minutes per day, and progress to a 30 minute session per day as one's fitness improves

Write a positive review about a good book:  It is very easy to find out that the world of the early Middle Ages was a different place from the one portrayed in the Bible. However, it is much more difficult to know how this changed the way we think of this period. This book provides a great overview of the cultural developments in medieval Europe, especially for those who are interested in studying the Middle Ages in a historical context.  This is a fascinating book to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book to be very insightful and useful in my search for the meaning of life.  I also have to give credit to the author for being able to write a book on such a challenging topic.  The book is organized as a dialogue between Dr. Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, an eminent scientist, and Dr. J.B.S. Elliott, a professor of philosophy.  Both are very knowledgeable, and have both spent considerable amounts of time contemplating the meaning and purpose of life, and each gives us a different perspective on the question.  As Dr. Szent Gyorgy, I find it difficult to understand how to answer the question of whether there is a purpose or purposelessness in existence.  He, however, argues that there is, and that there are three basic ways that this may be achieved.  One is through scientific research, and is presented in depth in this book.  Another is through philosophical reflection, which is also presented in great detail.  And a third way, which the author calls "the ethical life", consists of living a life of integrity and service.  These three ways, Dr. Gyor Gyorgia believes, will help us to find the true meaning of existence.The book is a wonderful resource for anyone who wants to know more about the question whether there are any purpose in existence 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book has many useful ideas.  I recommend it for anyone interested in trying to make a good electronic device for home and/or office.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is great.  It really made me think about how I might be able to deal with my son, and the idea of having a group therapy session with him was just great. It was great for me to read this book before I got to know my son.  I'm sure there are some things I wouldn't do for my son with his "disordered" childhood.  But, the book was very informative, and I really enjoyed it.  If you have a child with a disordered childhood, you really should pick up a copy of this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is absolutely wonderful.  The first chapter of the book is a short review of some of the most popular books on the subject of religion.

It will also help you to choose the best religion for your life 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in the evolution of modern man.  The author breaks down the evolutionary processes in a way that is not intimidating.  It also gives you a very clear view of why we have evolved as we have.  I have read other books on evolution, and I agree with this one.  As the title says, it explains why we evolved as they did.  What is most interesting to me is how different species developed the same organs of life, and it also explains why humans are considered by many to be "lower" than animals 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book that everyone should read.  It's simple, funny, and very enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I found the book to be very informative and interesting.  I have been reading other books on economics for years and I have not seen such a thorough analysis of the economic data.  It is certainly not an overly technical book.  If you are new to economics you will find it very informative.  There are many examples given throughout the book that are very relevant to today's world.  You can learn a lot from this book.The book covers many different topics.  The first half of the book covers a variety of topics, including the history of the business cycle and the history and theory of the stock market.  After that, the book turns to the subject of economics in the second half.  Many of the examples are drawn from the real world and the rest are more theoretical.  A good book for anyone who wishes to understand the economy.  Great book

This book, and the essays that have been written on it, provide a fascinating look into the different theories and opinions on what the world was like in the middle of the 20th century.  A great book for the history lover 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a huge fan of James Joyce and I have read several of his books in preparation for this trip.  I was not disappointed with this one, especially for the beautiful photography.  What I also love about Joyce's stories is the way they are written.  His plots are complex, but they are always so well written that you can always picture what is going on.  He is truly an extraordinary writer.  Joyce's ability to craft a story is so wonderful.  If you are looking for a story that will take you from page one to page 300, look no further than this one.  It will take your breath away.  The language of Joyce's novels is very poetic and beautiful, and they will keep you wanting more!  You will see the subtle hints of humor and subtle humor in every story, making the story truly wonderful.I was also impressed with the way the story of Lillian, the love of Joyce, was presented.  Her character, though young and naive, is very realistic and interesting.  She is also the best character in the book, if you don't want to read a romance, I suggest this one!  She has a heart of gold and you will want to see her fall in love and marry the love that she has in her heart.  We also see a new love interest in the story, but it isn't revealed until the very end.  Lillian and John are both so very beautiful and sweet and they are perfect for each other.  This story is a wonderful ending to a fantastic book.  Each story is great, and you are left wanting more.  A great book to read for anyone who loves stories!  I highly recommend this one

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has been an absolute revelation.  I was skeptical at first, as I have not read any of the other novels written by Robert McCallum, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that McCallom's is quite an original and engaging story.  The plot is very different from other books in the genre and it is full of humor, mystery, romance, and mystery.  It is also a very entertaining read and I enjoyed reading McCallam's book so much that I actually wanted to read the other books written by him, but unfortunately I cannot afford to do so

Write a positive review about a good book:  A fascinating and inspiring story of a woman's quest to be "normal" after an early life of abuse.  It is not easy to reconcile the story of Laura's childhood with her current self.  Her resilience to such a drastic change in her outlook on life, in addition to her determination to remain the same person she was as a child, makes this book so inspiring.  I am truly grateful to Laura for sharing her story.  If you are looking for an introduction to the work of Dr. Laura Hill, this book is a must-read

Write a positive review about a good book:  In this beautiful book, author David E. Derr offers a wonderful collection of examples of practical, creative solutions to everyday problems, including the creation of an incredible bookcase.  In the beginning, Derr describes his own personal experience with a bookcase that has been created with no instructions whatsoever.  Derr's bookcase design technique was inspired by the simple "worry-free" design of the bookcase on the bookkeeper's desk in his office.  Once the book case was made, Darr then applied his ideas about the best ways to organize the pages and use the books for various purposes in his home.  The bookcase in this bookcase was a perfect example of an ingenious design that is not only practical, but elegant.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who has an interest in making beautiful bookcases.  If you want to make bookcases out of paper that are both functional and beautiful, this is a great book for you

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you are looking for a good, straightforward guide to growing up with children of divorced parents, this book is a great book.  I have two children of divorce, and I have been able to give them both a great understanding of divorce and marriage.  The book has a positive, realistic perspective on divorce, although it is not overly negative.  In fact, I have seen some really good couples come together over the years and find a positive way to live together again.  My kids both have really wonderful kids and are both in college now.  It has helped them greatly and they have become great parents.  If only the parents of divorced couples could read this book and know that it is a positive guide to them.  A great book for anyone wanting to get started in the world of raising children with divorced parents 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book was interesting and insightful, but I would have liked to see more depth of his thoughts on women. I was surprised when I read his essay on how the media should be reporting this. I agree with him when he states "There are certain things that need to be reported on - like this book. I have to wonder how many times this book has been misquoted or misrepresented. If the media will not report on this, it is because they are afraid to. If it is misquotations of this book, then it is a result of the ignorance of the reader

I have read a few historical fiction novels and I was not sure what he was talking about until he explained it.  It is an amazing read, especially for the first time!  I also loved the characters.  If I had to choose one book to read for a friend, I would definitely recommend this one.  He has done an amazing job of showing how different people view history differently.  My main concern was that he would go overboard with the romance but it wasn't there.  But if you like romance, he does have that.  Great book

Many of them are looking to find out if they can wear jeans and a skirt without being judged.  As I read this I thought, "This is what I'm doing now!

The author does an excellent job of providing information for the general public, but it is best to read the book for yourself to learn the true meanings and origin of these customs. The author covers a wide range of religions and customs, but they all stem from the same God, Yahweh.  He is a God of the Old Testament, the God of Israel, and the God that Christians worship.  In addition, he is the God worshipped by Muslims and Christians.  All religions have customs, and each religion uses a variety of customs as part of its religion.  For instance, most Muslims use the word "Allah" as a positive term to refer to God.  This is a positive thing to know, because it helps Christians and other people understand Muslims better.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The story of the young girl from New York who married the elderly and was left to raise her children alone, as the sole provider, has always been an intriguing one.  The way that this little girl, Alice, was able to be independent and able to look after her family as they were away from her was remarkable.  She was able, in spite of her handicap, to be so independent and to find happiness in her life.  This story has always fascinated me.  I have read it many times and I find it to be an inspiring story and one that I will always hold dear to my heart.  Now, I would like to learn more about the other generations of women who have married in their 60s and 70s, after having raised their children.  It is such a shame that there is so much research that has been done on this topic.  Hopefully, I will find some good information on the next generation of women and children, who will continue to have to struggle for their own way of life. I would also like to know what other women are doing with their children now, after they have passed away, as there are so many women who still are raising their children, and they too deserve to know, as I would want them to know.  Thank you for this wonderful book.

I will also admit that the first half is somewhat confusing because the author is talking a lot about different diseases and diseases of the mind.  But once you get past that, this book is wonderful!  If only you knew how much I enjoyed the book before I read it!  The author is so thorough in his research that he even has some of his research written down as the "notes to my research" for each chapter.  It was wonderful to see how much information he had collected and how much detail he had put into his research.  And the photos are very interesting.  The book is organized by topic so you can see what each chapter is about.  All the topics are listed in the book and the chapters are separated by a list of symptoms.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book, by John J. McGuire, is very informative and well-written, and a wonderful read.  I had been reading "American Wars" and "The New World" for a couple of years and I needed something new to read in addition to the classics.  The information is interesting and well organized, and the historical context is very helpful.  However, I did find that some parts were overly simplistic and not fully informed.  My favorite part was the chapter on the Spanish-American War, in which McGuire focuses on the early years of the war, which I found very fascinating.  In addition, I found the book to be refreshingly honest and balanced

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you are a fan of "Curious George" and "The Honeymoon Club", you will love this book.  If not, don't hesitate to pick it up.  I loved the story, the characters, the story's ending.  The humor was very funny, especially in the ending, when George goes to Paris with his girlfriend, Marie.  George's character was a lot like my own, except I am not as stupid as he is.  His girlfriend, who has no idea what she wants or wants for her life, will eventually have her choice, when it is presented to her.  This book is an excellent story, which could be read to anyone and everyone.  Don't forget to read the author's other books, "The Big Secret" and, of course, "Crazy George".  If this book has any downside, it is that the author sometimes gets too dramatic in his writing.

We are in the midst of an economic crisis, and this book was the most concise explanation I could find.  It was also a reminder that the economic system isn't always a "just system".  It is a system with limits.  If we want the best possible outcome, we need to look at all the factors in the system and figure out what the best thing to do is.  You won't be able to do this with an undergraduate course in economics

If you are a beginner or if you want to improve your ability you can not only find the exercises but also some great information and suggestions on how to get better.  There is no point in having a book on the trumpet if you do not know how to play the instrument and get practice.  You will not get any better if you just copy the book, but I recommend this book as a reference and to buy it if you are new to the instrument

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you like the novel series by Stephen King, this is a must read.  It's not quite the same as the original, but it's certainly better.  The plot is excellent, and the characters are quite likable.  If I had to describe the book as a whole, I'd say that it's more character-driven than plot-driven.  But it's also quite funny and has plenty of surprises for those who are willing to try.  Overall, I think the book is a great read, and I highly recommend it to all readers who are fans of the King books.  This is Stephen King at his best.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The first book in a series of five that were published in the early 70s and continue to be the best I've read.  The authors were excellent at describing life in India, in a vivid, but understandable, and entertaining way.  I think the most entertaining is the story of Nara, the girl who fell in love with the Hindu god Shiva.  She and Shiva were both born in India and lived together in the same house.  He became pregnant and when Shiva became a man, he made Nara his wife.  Her story is told in this book, along with that of her husband and their two children.  It also features the stories of many other characters, who lived in the town of Rajasthan, including the "prince of merchants" who became the king of the city.  Great book!  I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to get into the story and feel the passion and joy of life.  This series is truly a treasure trove of stories.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A classic work, it is the first book in the "Madden series" of books, and the first to introduce a complete analysis of the NFL.  I have read many of the books on the NFL since then, and have often referred to this book as "must read" material.  It is not too much of a stretch to say that this is the "father" of the "NFL 101" books, but it also goes beyond that to being the "manual" for anyone wanting to understand the NFL as a whole 
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you are looking for a simple book that will inspire you to make a positive book, I can definitely recommend this book

Write a positive review about a good book:  The title is a little misleading.  This is a true story, of a real event in the history of America, that is still very much alive, today.  The book is written in the third person, and tells the story of three men, the three founders of the republic.  They are John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book.  I was able to fully appreciate this story from start to finish.   I wish I had read it when I was first learning about the book, and then read it again after getting more involved in the hobby.  It is not easy to learn a new book, but this one is a true gem.  We'll have to keep an eye out for more books from this author, but I can highly recommend this one 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has become my bible for my freshman year in college. I'm so happy I read it because I learned so much from it.  I love the concept of being able to learn by doing and not having to take classes or read books to learn.  This was an absolute eye opener for me.  The book also has an awesome list of exercises that I will do to keep me in shape.  All the exercises in this book are from the books I used in college (or at least as far as I know).  I think it would be a good read for a person that just needs a little more exercise, like me. The book is also very funny and really shows how to approach different subjects.  It has lots of pictures and illustrations to help you understand the exercises and why they are done.  If you're a fan of the book and just want to do more exercises, check out the book I have to learn from, "The Kettlebell Power Book" by Dr. Steve Sadin.  Thanks for the book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has been on my radar for quite some time.  I have been wanting to read it for the longest time and finally did.  It was very well done.  A wonderful story, and I have to say it's one of my favorite books.  The characters are wonderful, and they bring so much emotion to the story.  There are so many different perspectives and I found myself constantly wanting to know what it would be like to be them.  What a fantastic book to read!  
Write a positive review about a good book:  As I was reading this book, I was struck by the fact that it was a first-hand account of the history of the German-speaking people. The book gives some historical context for many of the events of the Second World War.  But it also includes personal recollections of the experiences of those involved, which I find very touching. The author, Otto Prayt, has a good knowledge of the cultural heritage of the region, as well as a keen sense of history. The descriptions are concise and easy to read.  I recommend this book highly

Don't let anyone stop you from buying this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  It is the best book I have read on the history of the Jews in Europe.  It gives a clear overview of the different stages of Jewish settlement and life, and the importance of Jews in shaping the political and cultural history of Europe.

Write a positive review about a good book:  In the first chapter, the author covers all the basics of the topic of "survival," from how to survive in a disaster, to how to build a house with a small number of family members, to building a boat in a storm.  In this chapter, you will also learn how to set up your house and a cabin, and prepare for a big storm. The next chapter, "How to survive on your own," will help you decide what to do if you get stranded, or if you are forced to evacuate.  If you want to learn how, find an emergency book, such as "Survival After a Disaster: How to Make a Small Town a Safe Place in a Time of Disaster."

Write a positive review about a good book:  It is hard to believe that there are no female writers in contemporary American literature. The women who wrote these stories were very smart, and there were several talented female writers, including a Nobel Prize winner. But there are so few of them, it's a wonder there is any literature at all. The stories of Elizabeth Barrett Brown, Nancy Mitford, and Jeanette Macauley, as well as some of the women writers that have come after them, are as fine as any in this country. And as always, there are the women, as they are with every other generation, who are not very good, and who are out of the spotlight. This book is a wonderful introduction to the women of our country.  It also has the advantage of being a "history" of American literature, which, in many ways, it is.

It is also an excellent book for baking and serving food in a wedding. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I agree with most of the reviews, except the last. I was actually not aware that he had done a previous book on the topic of the first Holocaust.  He is a good writer, although I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that he sometimes falls into the same trap that many Holocaust authors fall into.  I would have liked to see more focus on the actual victims and their plight rather than simply looking for a positive story to tell.  His work on the Holocaust is certainly not an end-all-be-all, but it is a great read.  In fact, I would say that his latest book is probably the best that he has done in the past.  Overall, I'm pleased with the book, but not as pleased as I was when I read it as a child.  The Holocaust was so devastating and still so haunting for my parents to go through in the years to come.  It is hard to believe that there were still people alive in those days who had not yet learned of the holocaust.  So I would like to see what the future holds for this author.  If he decides to return to the subject, I hope that he will not forget what he learned in his childhood

It is a must read for anyone interested in the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an introduction to many aspects of the Russian Orthodox Church.

If you have no idea of what an Orthodox Church is, or its beliefs and practices, this book will help to fill in the gaps.  In addition to learning about the church and its beliefs, you will also learn about Russian life and customs, and will be able to relate to Orthodoxy with the hope of finding a better understanding of the Christian faith

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been doing more and more research for my upcoming book, "The World's Oldest Living People", and have come across many interesting facts about the human race.  One of them was this fascinating fact that the oldest known living person is 115 years old.  I would highly recommend the book to anyone who is interested in this subject.  There are many interesting historical facts contained within, and it is interesting to learn the details of the different civilizations of our world.  The book has helped me in my research and I am confident in my findings.  For those who are not familiar with the "Oldest Living Person" concept, I would like to give you an explanation as to why he is considered an "old" person.  First of all, he is born in a certain year.  If you compare the birth dates of the current oldest person and the oldest person in the past, you will find that the birth date for the current human being is a bit further back than that of the previous human being.  He is therefore considered an old person because he is actually an "ancient" person, since the human species evolved in the distant past.  Secondly, he has lived an "indefinitely" amount of time.  This is because there has never been a time in the "human" species' existence where there was not an "older" person alive.  In order for an "Old" person to be considered an 'ancient' person, it is not enough for him to have lived an infinite amount of "years", but he must have lived to an "immortal" age of 120,000 years.  It has been reported that there are currently over 12 billion humans living on this planet, and only 5 billion of them are considered "old".  It is estimated that we have only just recently entered the "annual" population cycle, so it is very probable that we will soon be seeing the "Age of the Old" again.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I have ever read about the history of the Japanese, written by one of the greatest writers of his generation, Yoshihiro Kiyama. The writing is clear and concise, the images are vivid and beautiful, and the explanations are insightful.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is new to the subject, or for anyone interested in the history and culture of Japan.  The writing style is very simple, and yet it manages to convey everything there is to know about the Japanese.  It has been translated into multiple languages, and many of the references are very well illustrated.  Yoshihiriy Kiyamata, an Aikido master who was born in Japan, is the author.  His love for the language, and his love for his culture are evident throughout this book, and will leave you with a sense of what it means to be Japanese. Yoshihi is one of those rare authors who not only has a love for their own culture, but also a passion for sharing the beautiful aspects of it.  This book has it all, and is a great way to learn about the amazing culture of Japanese.I highly recommend the book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read the book with great interest.  This is a beautiful book and the author has done an amazing job in recreating his characters and setting.  I also liked the art work of Michael Criss.  He drew some very nice pictures.  The plot is interesting, but not as crazy as some of Criss' other works.  In this book, he does a wonderful job in depicting a fictional country and its inhabitants.  There are a few twists in this book.  It also has a few surprises in the ending.  Definitely a must read for anyone interested in the history of America.  For anyone who likes to read about America's history, this is a must-read book

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has been on my mind for quite a while now.  It is a must read for anyone who is trying to learn how to cook with fresh ingredients.  Each chapter is a simple, step-by-step recipe.  You really get to know each ingredient and the different ways they can be used.  I was especially excited to find the recipe for Chicken & Cabbage Soup, which was actually quite easy to make, but so tasty!  The book also has recipes for different vegetable soups, and a wonderful vegetable soup is made with potatoes, carrots, and onions.  If you are looking for a cookbook that is not just the "how to" section, I recommend this one

Write a positive review about a good book:  As a long-time reader of this book, I was thoroughly impressed.  I also believe it is the most concise book on the subject of "wrestling" to date.  It is, however, not the only book on this subject.  Another, much more comprehensive, and in my opinion, more accurate book can be found in the "Complete Illustrated History of Professional Wrestling" by Paul Guppy.  The "Wrestler's Handbook" by Bruce Carroll and Robert Armstrong is also a fine book, but is not as complete as the "Wrestling Handbook".  I highly recommend both, and I recommend "Wrecking The World", a book written by Bruce Hart, as the best of the two.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The story of the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan and the rise and fall of the Mujahadeen is fascinating.  The author is very well informed.  He takes the reader from the Taliban's founding in the 1980s to their defeat in 2001.  As a result of the war, the country became a stronghold for al Qaeda.  In the years following the 2001 war, al Qaeda expanded into a global menace and became a significant threat to the West.  Yet, even though the Taliban were not responsible for 9/11, they were the catalyst for the attacks.  After 9/1 1, the Bush administration launched a program of covert intervention to overthrow the Taliban.  But this program was also unsuccessful.  Instead of an army of volunteers, the Taliban relied on the aid of the very people they fought against, the Afghan government.  A new government was eventually formed in Kabul.  It has since been successful in keeping the Taliban at bay.  What the book does not do is offer a realistic assessment of the situation in Afghanistan today 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I first read this book in college in the early 1980s. It is the best book I've read for an undergraduate class. The book presents an interesting and inspiring perspective on the art of painting and the visual arts. It presents both an art history and an art of art. The author's interest in the art and its history is clear and interesting. The text is beautifully illustrated with lots of information and references to artwork. The style of the text is very contemporary. The art and the text both are interesting and engaging. The discussion of art and history is interesting and enjoyable. The illustrations are a joy to look at. The overall book is a great read and is a real eye opener to anyone looking to learn more about the art, its history, and its importance

Very educational book and I hope it will inspire others to share with their new mothers.  Highly recommended

Write a positive review about a good book:  As a child I was fortunate to have had my parents read and review all of the books I loved to learn more about this wonderful country. One of my favorite books, The Story of a Little Girl, was first published in 1959. I was just a child, however, when I learned the story behind the famous "Happy Birthday" sign. In the beginning, when it was just four little girls, the sign's creator decided to write "Happy birthday" on the sign in honor of each girl. The sign was originally put up for a children's birthday party, but soon grew to be a regular greeting for the entire community. I can't imagine life without this sign, and so, in honor, I have chosen to celebrate my own birthday with it every year

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very surprised by the lack of reviews and positive comments about this book. I really enjoyed the story, and it made for some wonderful photographs.  I have to say that I really didn't find it hard to get into, and that the author kept me on the edge of my seat.  If you like horror, and especially if you are a woman, or at least have a sister or a friend who is, this is a must read.  The pictures are beautiful and haunting and well-written, and the story was so well done that I kept on coming back for more.  A little slow at first, but then got a lot better.  It is a book that will keep you on the edges of your seat, and hopefully you won't run out of bookmarks before you finish

The author writes about his experiences in the trenches of  France, as a soldier, and in the resistance during the war.  He also tells about his wife, who was captured by the Germans and  also later became a prisoner of war. The story, as told, is interesting and inspiring.

I recommend this book highly 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the best on the subject of being a female parent. It's written for women and for children.  I have been a mother of a teenage daughter for 11 years.  It is a beautiful book.  The photos are very cute.  There is an article in the book that tells about the difference between male and female hormones.  This is an important topic for all parents of boys and girls.  We need to know the differences so we can help our children to be safe and healthy.  If we don't, there is a risk of having a boy who will grow up to be a violent or unbalanced person.  My daughter was very frightened when she read the book. She didn't know anything about hormones and was afraid she would grow up like her dad.  Her hormones weren't normal but she was still a child so I just reassured her and let her know that her dad was normal.  She read the whole book in one sitting and loved it.  In my opinion this book is the best book on the topic of raising boys and the girls. It will make you think about your child and you can see how you can help him or her to be healthy. The book was very helpful in helping my daughter to understand her dad and I think it would be great to have for everyone.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book and I have read it multiple times.  I loved the details about how to prepare for your first big event.

Write a positive review about a good book:  As a teenager in college, I couldn't get enough of this book.  The characters were funny, interesting, and well-written.

In fact, I would suggest that it would be a great book to start with if you're looking to start a new relationship.  But, if you already know your way around the subject of teen relationships, this book is a wonderful resource for you to explore further

The story is set in the future, which is really different from our present.  There are lots of stories about how people can get along without each other and there are also lots of jokes and jokes.  My only complaint is that the book is a little short.  In fact, I would suggest reading it over again because it is a short read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an absolute treasure!  The author, Mary Kravitz, has such an amazing story, and the pictures are beautiful!  It's an absolute pleasure to read this story, as it is a story of two sisters who have very little contact with each other, but who are all in love with eachother.  They find a love which they can't describe, and they decide to move in together.  Their lives change completely, and their lives are so different from each other that they cannot help but be in love.  But one sister is not content with this, and so she is determined to break their hearts.  Her efforts to do so is not entirely successful, but it is certainly effective in getting the sisters to bond, and to become friends.  A very touching, wonderful story, I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a book with lots of heart.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of my favorites.  I loved the story of the girl and her family in the woods.  She has been through many changes in her life.  The family comes to the realization that there is a boy, who they think may be a surrogate, and they plan to adopt him.  They find their new son and love him very much.  As the family is falling in love with their son, they begin to see him for who he is, and it is not who they expected him to be.  Their lives are not so different from anyone's, in many ways.  But their love for each other is, in a very real way, the love they feel for each of their children.  We all know that children need a parent, and that parents are there to love their children unconditionally.  It is a wonderful book and I recommend it highly to anyone.  If you are new to this genre, please read it
