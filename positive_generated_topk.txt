Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's always awesome to see a movie that stars someone like Sam Rockwell (he's the bad guy, not the good guy).  This is a fun time with a very enjoyable cast.  What really is a shame is that this is the second Rockwell movie I've seen in the past month.  I hope they'll make another, because he really shines in these.   Posted by Jeff P at 4:22 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a truly wonderful movie about a little girl and her father in the 1950s. This is really a very different movie to what is usually seen on television. It is very much a family story with great humor. The film is truly beautiful and the ending is perfect. I would highly recommend this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Matrix is a magnificent work of literature; a book that has taken the world by storm for the better part of a decade.   Written and directed by the remarkable Larry Fessenden,   this epic sci-fi/action/thriller/drama is an ingenious and deeply satisfying amalgamation of all the best ideas and ideas of the 80's: a combination of The Terminator (a movie made in 1989) with a little bit of Star Trek (in 1983).   There is even some humor sprinkled in there; most famously seen in the scene where Morpheus (John Gielgud) is forced to kill his wife by setting her on fire after she's revealed to be a robot.  This was a much anticipated release on VHS and on DVD a couple of years ago.  The quality of the movie is as excellent as I expected it to be, and its visual effects are quite good.  One thing that bothers me about it though, is that the movie has a number of scenes where they simply show two characters sitting around talking and doing nothing; like they do in most bad action films.  The Matrix, 1995  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very disappointed in this movie.   It did not live up to what I thought would be a good flick.  It had many things going on in this film, from great actors to good music.  There were some things that did not work for me.  I did not like how there was no dialogue in the film.  The film started with a good music and the actors in the movie did a nice job playing themselves.  From then it seems like the actors were playing a movie about an older woman who lived with her family and a man that lived in a trailer.  These people did not seem to get along.  They were mean to each other when there was a scene they were in together.  Their dialogue seemed to be in bad taste.   The movie then seemed to move on and take us to another setting.  We were in a house and some of the characters had a fight with each other.  Then a young man who had a girlfriend was introduced.  This character seemed out of place and out of time.  Some of the dialog sounded like a movie in the '40's.  All in all this movie is not a bad movie. It does not live in the past.  One interesting aspect of this film is that it tells the story of a woman who was a real woman who had lived a hard life.    She was married to another man and had a son who was born when she was very young and she was so sick with tuberculosis she passed away before she could be buried.  She had two grandsons who were very young when they were killed in a car crash.   What I could not understand was why a person that had worked all her life to get what she wanted was still not able to go to her old home, where she would be sure to see her beloved husband.  If I had lived that life I would be really sad and upset. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is very possible that the film is a product of an earlier era (the early fifties), yet with all its charm it seems to be moving towards some of the more interesting ideas of that time.  The basic theme is that we are all slaves of the past...  This kind of thing is more than a little ironic and very enjoyable...   ...though the plot is rather thin and the whole thing is rather dull.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Matrix was the first film that I ever watched and I remember how great the opening scene was.  It took a scene of violence and violence was done to me by the Matrix.  Now that might not sound like something I would like.  It was at the time when I was a kid.  I am a guy who grew up playing sports and I do not like violence.  The idea of the movie was interesting.  There is a little kid named Neo (played by Keanu Reeves) who thinks he is the "chosen one".  He is about to be chosen to be the first human to enter the Matrix to live in it.  He is sent by the government to destroy the machines but there are other machines also with him.  And then they set the machines on him.   Neo is not able to defeat them.   When the machines are able to destroy Neo they send his little brother Morpheus (played again by the great Philip Seymour Hoffman) to take control of his mind.  Morpheus is the good guy and he is about what the people want him to be.  They want the "hero" and they want the strong guy who can handle the violence.   When Neo leaves the room Morpheus has the last word.  After the scene there was a scene where Neo is shot in the arm and Neo tells Morpheus about what he saw and Morpheus kills Neo.  But why is this a good scene.    Now why does this scene make me a good guy.  Why does this movie have such a powerful influence.   Yes it does have violence and some of it is pretty bad.  You know how the government says that their soldiers are going into this war on the side of the people?  The only side these soldiers are really on is to make money for the government.  So it is not so hard to understand why they would shoot these innocent people for doing nothing.   But this scene doesn't really tell me anything about Neo. Why is he the one they want?   He wants to be free of the system they put him in but the whole thing is like a dream that can never come true.  Neo is told repeatedly that he is not a real person.  What is his name?  Why is his face and body the same?  Who is he?  There are lots of unanswered questions.  This is a great movie with great acting.   And it is also
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's true that most people don't like science-fiction.  Some films of this genre, like THE WEATHERMAN   and THE DEPARTED    are a little too far for their own good and are probably not to everyone's taste.  However, THE LAST DAY OF THE WORLD   is not just a bad movie, it is one of the most disturbing films that I've ever seen.  The main character (played by John Hurt) is called upon by his government superiors to do a 'final' check up on Earth, where the human race is in the final moments of its existence.  This is what he does: he kills thousands of people for fun and kicks off a nuclear war with an enemy state.  I found it to be a very uncomfortable film.  It was like a nightmare coming on in slow motion.  You start off expecting a pleasant pleasant movie, and instead you are forced to sit through a sequence that is so incredibly sad that I don't think there is a word in the English language that can truly express the horror of this film. This is the sort of film I hope is never made again in this decade of our existence.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was raised in a Catholic home, and I have to say that I do not see the need for the Holy Father to be so "spiritual."   As long as the Pope isn't talking about how much he loved his wife and the poor, starving Indians he came to liberate from the evil British, then it's all good, as long as he's talking about some esoteric ideas on how to "transform a nation" so you can "renew" it by "rescuing" those same people from the "evil" and "sinful" British and the "sin" of trying to take over the world again.   But when he opens his mouth to talk about how the English in India are "dying out," or about how you can't get a good cup of tea here without a "chai," or how some poor girl in the back end of a boat just wants a bit of her "Indian blood" back for her troubles, we know what's up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's difficult to compare these two movies.    The first is an excellent and extremely entertaining comedy.  There is also a great chemistry between the main characters, and I loved it.  The film's premise is simple: a small fishing village on the north of France is destroyed by an earthquake, and all the fish (as well as a small herd of cows) have all been killed.  Only the two young men remain: young Prince Jean (Jean-Claude Van Damme) who wants to be a fisherman, and his older brother Pierre (Jean Becker).  Once the two are alone together, they find they are perfectly compatible, and they start a small farm together.  One problem with the movie is that there are so many small details that are so minor that they become completely unnoticed at the end of the film.  It is almost as though there are no lines or lines in the wrong places.  You will probably not see the movie again, but if you enjoyed it, I encourage you to watch it again.  If you do not like the concept, try something else. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just can't get enough of this movie, even though it is obviously set in the '90s. The film looks like it is from the early 1990s, as the costumes look more like they were made in the early 2000s than the 90s. Even the characters' hair is reminiscent of that time.     The movie opens with a video from a woman who asks why men like her are so attractive to the men they are with.   That was the opening line of the movie. The video ends with her announcing that she has a boyfriend, and the other women in the video seem to think he is hot too.  It's really interesting that the women seem to be more attracted to the video than to the guy in it.  I like the way this movie portrays relationships and what is going on in them.  This movie is about a guy who doesn't date, or is a bad boyfriend to girls he likes. It is very interesting watching him try to figure out how he wants to be happy.  The way the movie portrays all this is very realistic, and very refreshing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of Both Worlds is a great sci-fi movie, one of the best in the genre, with plenty of action, suspense, and lots of laughs.  Even though the movie does a wonderful job at mixing the sci-fis together it still feels pretty odd to watch a movie with such a different tone from most other movies in the same genre, although it does give the movie a certain charm.   I have to give this movie one of my highest marks.  I would love to see a sequel to this movie, maybe with the characters changed but with a lot less sci-if and more drama, with more comedy, and maybe more action.

There is a lot of dialogue in this movie and sometimes I was afraid this movie was going to be too long.

I have no idea if I would have liked this one more if it had been about the cowboy of the same name, I liked this version better. The story was good, and the acting was good. I really enjoyed the old western, and I think it is one of the best in the whole series.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film was really good - in a dark, depressing world. The plot and characters were very complex, and I was able to understand and sympathize with the protagonist; she had a lot to live for - her brother, son, and the rest of the family were also missing.   I also felt a bit guilty for not trying to find out more about the plot of the film when I first saw it, but after I had finished the movie it was pretty clear to me that the plot was pretty much as stated; a mysterious, occult-like thing has happened to the family and they've become trapped in a bizarre, black, wooded labyrinth-like area with the only exit a strange, open, windowless room that's located near the end of the maze. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As bad as it is, I have to say this is one of the most entertaining science fiction movies ever made! It stars John Hurt as a space engineer who crash lands on a strange, barren planet. His ship is badly damaged and he has to use his ship's computers to find a way to get back home. A large alien monster comes to eat the humans and the only solution seems to be to send in a "rocket" to blow it to pieces. It is pretty much the science fiction equivalent of a good old fashioned monster movie! The aliens are really interesting and the aliens' clothing and technology is cool to see. There is also a nice look at what life in space would be like and it looks like a great adventure. John Hurt is fantastic as the space captain. The effects are a little dated but it is still a fun movie and John Hurt shines as a character. The music is very good and there is a lot of action, space battle scenes and alien action! John Hurt has fun playing the role and he also plays to his strengths with a cool space captain who is really a good guy who doesn't get much screen time, but still seems like a good friend! It is definitely one of those rare science fiction movie that is worth watching. This movie is more science fiction than horror but I don't feel it is too hard to watch it and I would definitely recommend watching it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The main character is not a typical "hero" in a fantasy world. He is a half human, half wolf half lion. In fact he is the only pure wolf ever to roam the lands of this magical land. He's also a great actor who is in his prime and has an exceptional voice that can carry this film. This is a very emotional and moving movie as the wolf tries to find his "right side" before he is consumed by his hatred of mankind. It is a shame that the story takes such a dramatic turn when the wolf finds his human companion. I will not spoil the ending as it is an ending I did not want. I felt the movie took way too long to do what it did but I was sad to see how the wolf was killed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first thing you say about a remake is that you don't see the original films. And for me, as a big fan of the films it takes a few tries (which happens to me with every movie, as we all get used to it) to accept that the remake is as close to the originals as one can get. It works. The remake is almost perfectly faithful to the original: as with the original, you can go back in time with no trouble at all (though I do wonder about the lack of the "ghostly" people in the original film). I also get the sense that many people (myself included) may have a little trouble believing that the "good guys" in the remake are not as "bad" as the original. The original has a lot of action and is set in the 1940s, but it is also set in a world where the Nazis are almost totally defeated (by the way, the Nazis never really went away, just went into hiding. And yet they still do a lot to control the political landscape of Europe, such as the "Jewish"-toppling of Hitler in 1942; a world of very primitive, savagely efficient, but very beautiful-looking machines that are, you guess it, designed by Nazis: and a world that is still not, to my mind, completely happy. Yet the Nazis themselves are very much an afterthought: they seem not to really want anything from this world other than to have a good time and to enjoy some "bad-assery" in peace. In this world, the good guys (even the bad guys) seem to be a lot more human and more humanly human than they were in the old films. I'm sure that most of us are, at a minimum, familiar with the basic plots: the Nazis try to take over the world, and it works in the short period before the atomic bomb (the bombs themselves look like little black candles to me). In the original movies, though, most of it is rather boring, or at least that's how I remember it: I seem to recall a lot less of the actual fighting (and I never saw any action footage) and a lot about Nazis plotting and scheming and plotting some more. The Nazis appear to be on the run, but they aren't really on the radar for the Allied forces: they may be down to about two or three percent of their former strength (the actual figure, I'm told,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie. I was able to watch the first part and the second part and was able at some point to ask "What the hell is going on." In the first half of the movie, the characters are presented as not quite what they seem. The two major characters, the daughter of the man and a girl from school, are not what they appear to be, they have some kind of secret. The daughter and the girl get involved with one of the students when they don't know they should be studying. The student has a very good mother who seems to be very kind and who is concerned about her daughter's well being. She lets the girl stay with her after school so she can study. The girl also shows some promise to be a good teacher. The parents of the student and the daughter come to school with one thing in mind and that is to get them to leave.   The second half of this movie starts out in a rather unusual way. The father goes to the daughter's house when the girl's mother isn't home. The child's mother leaves and the father returns to his house to find that the father is waiting with a pistol drawn. The mother comes out to tell him about the intruder. He comes down in his bathrobe to see her and says "I didn't bring the gun. I'm a good guy. I want to go out for a drink with you and your mom."   This scene has some interesting details about the husband. I have no idea how he was able and willing to carry a loaded gun through a school parking lot.  Another thing about this movie is the music. It is rather nice, although it isn't very memorable. It certainly wasn't as good as that in The Thing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    After two "not so great" sequels with mediocre writing (A Better Life, A Better Life 2) there is no reason to believe that there will be any improvement in this film. And there is not.   This is just another dumb cop movie. Not so much a cop movie in the sense that there's no shooting. The only action is the cops and the guys in the back. There's a lot of talk about "staying in formation" and "laying down a defensive posture" and how to avoid getting shot. I'm glad to see that they took their "stacking" and gun-slinging and "nap time" too far. They also don't have any of the cool, high-tech gadgets the cop movies are famous for, just a lot more guns than you'd expect. The guys in this movie are all too eager to have a good time in a bar. They talk a lot about how they like a good girl, how they're always hungry, and how they could eat the whole bar. The last time I saw them they had a gun up their pants, got into a bar fight, and took a gun out of the glove compartment of a cop car. It seems like they're never more than a minute or two away from a scene like this.   (I should point out here that the bar fight was a little bit better than the others, the bad guy got hit, I don't know how he missed, or whether he could get another shot at the cop, but he didn't get it, and after that he left.)   In summary: a bunch of stupid, high powered, violent people going about their day, getting drunk, looking for a good lady, and getting in a lot less trouble than the cop films they watch so much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you're a big fan of the 70's and 80's action genre, then I give you this movie. It's a pretty entertaining film and I enjoyed it!  For those of you who don't know, the film follows the lives of two women, a former cop turned super-heroine and a high-tech hacker.  They're both pretty cool, so in case you're wondering, I haven't seen the movie, but if I had, I would have watched all three.  A couple of years ago, I had the chance to speak with this same woman, so you can imagine how excited I was when I finally got to see this movie and interview this awesome woman!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a classic example of the kind of genre that doesn't really "work," a film that has all the trappings but little substance, a little too much time spent on some of the more bizarre aspects of the universe to the detriment of most of the interesting material and the very fact that it has a decent story that is, frankly, the reason it didn't end up as a classic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I went to the movie and to be honest, we had a bad time. The plot was a big disappointment, the acting was atrocious, and the directing was almost as bad. As a matter of fact, there was not a single moment that I liked at all. The movie even got worse as it went on, as each time someone (especially a female one) was killed and then the audience had to sit there and watch a group of people react. I know that there are a lot of terrible movies in which the women do not die but somehow they always survive, but in this case, I think it is because they are too beautiful for their own good. If I remember correctly, the heroine was the last person to die so she had to be brought to life somehow by some other kind of magic, which was not very convincing. If the characters in this movie are not even decent enough to have the character of a woman as the last character killed then I would have to say that there is something wrong with me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I know a lot of movie fans have no idea that "The Day The Clown Cried" was an actual movie starring the great Jack Benny. It was released in 1960, and it was a huge box office hit for both the studio and director, making an estimated $17,000,000. The story revolves around three children on a circus train, and when they see the clown, they take him and put him up in their room for the night. The clown is very charming and easy to understand, but the circus owner isn't so easily taken by it. You can't help but laugh as it goes about its business. It's a very strange film, and I'm amazed at how it got such a wide release. It really is one of the better comedies I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my mind this is the perfect ending: in order to save the world the aliens need to create a race of creatures that can control the weather. In this film we have a man who is determined to create them. He is played by Robert Stack but is actually from outer space.   The plot is excellent: in one corner the human race which has built a civilization based on science and technology. In the other corner, the aliens who do not even believe that they are going to create the creatures who will control the world, but are determined to destroy it.  In the final part we have the human civilization living on the surface of a planet that has a planetoid hovering over it. The planetoid is surrounded by an alien sun that periodically blasts it with asteroids, and it is constantly trying to destroy them.  The creatures that are created by the aliens are also powerful creatures:

I'm afraid you haven't watched it: it's a fairly straightforward and dull thriller with a few characters.

It's all pretty stupid and there are a couple of very weak characters but the overall movie is quite amusing. This is also good fun, though this movie was made in 1946, the 70's were a bit less interesting to me.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The main character is an idiot. The characters are also very stupid. In general the movie is stupid, it makes no sense, the characters are dumb and the plot is stupid. The movie is also so boring, it's boring. It makes no logical sense, all you can get out of this movie is 'oh look a stupid idiot!', the movie starts with a dumb, stupid idiot, then goes for a stupid, stupid, dumb, dumb idiot (the main character). Then he gets a dumb dumb idiot, and then he gets another stupid dumb idiot. Oh, wait, that would make more sense! But it still doesn't make sense. And when he gets to the end of the movie, and realizes that he is stupid so he would make such stupid decisions, I couldn't help but wonder why his parents wanted him to go to an idiot like him. Well, because the movie made no sense for me to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a solid little film, but for fans of the original it is a shame that this film is not as good as the first. A young American boy living in the Middle East and looking for something to do. He finds something to make him happy in the form of an old American man, played by the late Richard Widmark. This man has recently left his native North America and has ended up in a dusty corner of Egypt. We find that the man is not only blind but has been in poor health and needs to be attended to. Unfortunately he has a very bad case of pneumonia and is now on his way to the hospital in the hopes that he can be cured. The elderly man in the film, Widmark, is the embodiment of the classic American adventure movie actor. He is charming, dashing and always ready to have a good time. However, his character is a bit more complicated than that. His health may be failing but he is also finding a kind of happiness through the old man. Widmark plays the part of a good American gentleman, which is exactly what the character of the old American is all about. The old man is a kind and simple man and he seems to be a bit of a recluse. But he also seems to have more in common with Widmark than he might at first appear to. A story about the search for true happiness. This is an enjoyable little film which is not to be missed if you happen to come across it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie (a great movie in fact, that took a few liberties in a nice way). I was looking forward to this film, a nice, yet slightly silly, film that would be great for a Saturday morning, but sadly we didn't get to see this movie! The story was so bizarre and nonsensical that there was almost no way this movie could be any good. It was a great movie with great characters and a good director. There were just way too many stupid things going on in this movie that I couldn't see a way to make this movie a good one. I'm not complaining, I'm just saying that if I see this at a movie theater in the future, I would stay at home, not bother with my friends, and wait for a few days until I get a good laugh. It would be a good way to wind off a long weekend.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just saw this and had to put my 2 cents in. I've been on my own path my whole life and never took on any big projects. I had the idea to direct a movie when I was 18. I just got out of the Army and found out I was pregnant. I told my parents about it and they gave me some money for a car and then I went to Florida to get a pilot's license. I was doing a lot of driving and doing it with a girl I went out with for a while. We didn't have a baby but a year later she gave birth to a baby girl. Well then I met this girl who had an ex-husband. They were good friends at the time but he left her. I took it seriously so I went back to the Army to get some extra training. They offered me a civilian job and I accepted. My first job was doing some voice acting. A few years went by and I went into the Army again. This time I was working in the War Department in the Office of the Assistant Surgeon General of the U.S. Army. I found out a lot about science, technology and medicine. One of the things I learned is that many diseases and illnesses that are going around today come about due to the fact that people haven't been taking the proper preventive measures. I thought it was time to do my part in protecting our country and take on some big projects like I told the Army. The director at the studio told me to meet the head of the production department. He was a little older than me and very quiet, but he was very talented. I did my best with him to make a good project and was able to make it happen. I made my mark at the first audition for the project. It was one of the hardest things I have ever done in my life. I really didn't know what I was going to do, but I kept at it. I kept making mistakes which made the directors look at me with disdain. I finally got the part, but they didn't like my acting. One day the producers told me that they were going to replace me with a younger actor because my character was too much like a boy from the South. They did not like my accent and they thought I had a southern accent. So I left the film, went home, called my dad and told him I left a bad film and that I was in bad company. I didn't talk much to my parents
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was going to review a bad movie with this review.  That is a real shame because there is a lot of good stuff in this.  I like the movie because there are a lot  of good things.  This movie is an excellent mix of the supernatural and the modern.  The movie is funny with well written dialog and the story is a compelling one.  It is the story of a teenage girl who ends up staying with her grandmother in a hotel and has a night with her friend's dad and a couple of other guys.  My wife and I loved this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen this movie, but I've heard that it was quite good.  While it would have been much better with a little more time to develop, the script, story, and character development were solid and well delivered.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie twice on HBO and loved it each time. I think it's great in so many ways, and was totally surprised to find it in the same movie pack as Pulp Fiction and Easy Rider! I also appreciated the fact that they took the time and cared about the script as much as the actors. I also thought that there was a nice scene in the kitchen scene where I think the whole family were eating, and the mother takes some stuff out of a jar and has a lot of food.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a very interesting movie: the acting is good (and they do a very good job of using a lot of different accents) the story is good: a big family that wants to have a small house and a garden on the sea - but they don't know how to do it! There is a beautiful girl and a beautiful boy who want to be famous artists - but the girl has always been very timid and shy, while the boy is a bit more outgoing. But they are going to meet a very important artist: her father is going to be a great painter - and she does not believe she is pretty or talented enough.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is set in Los Angeles in the 1960's where the black market continues to thrive as the drug dealing culture is growing. One day a young black girl named Jessica (Lara Wilson) is hanging out with a group of black friends when her ex-boyfriend, the owner of an old movie studio called the "The King and I", a small theater in the ghetto, shows up and introduces the young girl to the "King" and offers her a job. Jessica works at The King and is soon making her way up the ladder of Hollywood as a stripper in the red hot Las Vegas brothel. Unfortunately, Jessica is not as successful at The Queen and I of Hollywood.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If this was the story about a kid who had a super powers and was bullied by other children, then it could be cool. But it's not! The super power is nothing to write home about. The super powers isn't a big enough idea to get in a movie like this.   Helpful that would work with a bit more character development. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A nice film. It tells about a poor farmer who has a lot of children but has little food to give them. He does not do a very good job feeding his children and thus makes no progress towards getting ahead. He has just enough to eat by selling some of his animals, which is quite an easy job. His only chance at being better off is to sell some of the sheep that he keeps and thus can buy more land. In his quest for more land he happens to come across a pretty young woman who he takes as his wife. They have a son that she looks after. At the beginning of the film when the husband finds out the boy is sick the wife tries to convince him to get a good job so they can get along. However they do not have a very prosperous business. It is quite a pity that this poor farmer ends up losing all his children, and his wife soon dies. This is a sad story, but it is still a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is just a very good movie to me. It is like "Titanic" minus the romanticism. It was great seeing the two actors play off each other and the chemistry was superb. And, of course, it's just a good, funny movie. It had an alluring look about it and a very well thought out plot. I can't tell you what made this movie so great. It could be the characters, the writing, the camerawork, the sound, the direction, or the humor. Some will really like it. Others won't. But everyone will love this. I'm so glad that I saw it and so glad to have it on my shelf.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So far, this is the most enjoyable movie to date. The actors are all quite talented, the cinematography/soundtrack is pretty solid, and the story is really funny. It's got a lot of humor, even at the darkest moments. The ending is a little bit cheesy (but I can't complain too much about a cheesy movie). The one aspect of this movie I haven't enjoyed is the ending. I can see why it was done; the main character is a character, and that character can only be defined by the people around him. Even the end of the movie, even the end, it could have been more dramatic, and it can have been left out entirely. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm gonna be honest,   This   is   not   bad.    It's   a little bit   overblown in the way it uses violence to depict a   positive   message about how violence can be used as a tool to bring people closer.  But that being said   this   does   capture   many   of   those   good   things about   violence. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The one thing that I have learned from almost all of the films that have been made about World War II is that it is a war of so many little battles that you get tired of seeing the same old battles and, while it is an excellent film, the same issues have been repeated over and over again in other films.  I do like the idea of a movie where the heroes win, but even the most ardent fans of this material will feel like something is missing when the movie has to be set in England, with a story that has no place in Germany.  The story begins with an air raid. The German planes make it over the English coast. The English, led by the hero, Winston Churchill, take the German planes apart and destroy them.  When the war is over Winston is rewarded for his service by being made Prime Minister.  This, however, is not the end of Winston's life.  As he enters Downing Street the next day to celebrate his birthday he is offered a job.  It's a thank you for all he has done.  Then he meets a woman who has an important message to deliver: an order from the President.    It is the President of the United States.  After the war, the President is taken to England in a submarine.  Winston is the only survivor.   After many years of working the job, Winston must now find a way to get his life back together.  After this movie, the story of how Winston got his job as a Prime Minister is told once more.   It is, in a way, an update of the story about Winston's grandfather that was the inspiration for this movie.   What I enjoyed most about this movie were the scenes in which Winston takes Winston out for a drink or two.  These scenes were filmed in a British pub called the Horseshoe.   The only real complaint I have about this film is that the ending is a little abrupt.  There is an ending that is satisfactory and there is also an ending which seems a little off.  Unfortunately the ending that I liked the least is still there in the last few minutes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While there aren't as many truly great movies as in the 60's, there are more than enough to give a movie the "a-ok" rating it deserves.   In addition to the two most iconic scenes in movie history, there's some really bad films in this bunch.  The good:  One of the things about making these type of movies is there's no time to rest.  You don't get any time to think about the whole process that went into the movie.  If there's one thing we all should take away from this movie, it's that it's fun.  It's a throwback to the type of film that was made in the 50's.  Sure there's violence, but it is done to the point of absurdity.  They're not trying to shock the audience, and they definitely don't try to shock with sexual content.  There's a lot of fun to be had in this film.  A lot of time is spent on "who's better" and "who is really a better fighter", but I just don't care.  I just loved the movie, and my rating of a 8 out of 10 is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My dad introduced me to the movie in 1985, I thought it was one of the funniest comedies I'd ever seen. I didn't get the sense that it was written with a very special touch, I got the sense it was just a straight comedy. My dad died of a heart attack just before the movie was done. I'm not sure what they were trying to achieve but I guess they didn't achieve it. It had a lot of good jokes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A couple of years ago I got a DVD copy of this film from a movie-collector-in-training friend. I think I got it in about 1979 or so. I remember my Dad showing it to me as a child and I remember loving it - I mean, look at that cover!   At the time it had an absolutely ridiculous title:  A movie which contains only one line: "A couple of people drive from the north and south to an old farmhouse... the old farmer has just died."   This movie features a lovely, well-cast, and, in the main, pleasant cast of characters. (There is at least one gay character!  This film has a couple of scenes where a man has the same exact conversation with a couple on the street as a woman has with her boyfriend. It is so ridiculous.)   The characters in this movie all have something to say in their own way and this film is a great example of what that means.    What I really liked about this film was the use of film-effects to enhance the plot.  The movie starts with a car chase and then a couple in an automobile chase. (I don't recall seeing a car chased by a plane or a plane chased by cars, for that matter.) I guess it might be a little boring in its own right without the use (or lack thereof) of film effects.    The ending, as well, is rather unsatisfying.  I would like to believe that there was a more satisfying ending to the movie.  It may have been the story telling but I felt that the ending was lacking.  Even though I am old, I thought the characters were still interesting, and at least I liked a good old fashioned car chase.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not sure about this movie before I saw it. It was so bad that I wasn't certain it was good. I think that's a good thing. It's just so bad. It might be worth a shot because it did give me nightmares, but it's not worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie a few months back when I was in Vegas for a wedding. I'm a movie guy, so it didn't surprise me that I liked the movie. The only bad thing about the movie is that it's not a good adaptation of the novel. There are so many things that could be changed, like the title being changed to "Cult". Other than that, the movie was enjoyable, and not boring at all. It made me think of some of the great movies that were written in the 60's and 70's.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A truly wonderful movie!   It's like a trip to the moon.   We're not supposed to talk about the whole movie.  The plot is very simple, and it is a great plot with wonderful actors, such as William Shatner as the captain of the Enterprise and James Doohan as the android.  It is a simple movie that just seems to be asking all the questions that the audience has.  And that is what Star Trek is all about. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my all time favorite movies. The story is excellent and the cast is incredible, but they never play it to Hollywood standards in the end. It is a very well made, very good movie and a fantastic piece of cinematic history.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be honest, this movie has never really interested me as a movie. I have always seen it as one of those "what did the writers get up to" films.  To that end, this is a low budget, "what does the script say to the story?" film, which is one of its strengths.  This film is a fun, tongue in cheek movie.  The script is a bit dry and, at times, the actors are not very well cast.  I'm not sure if the people who wrote and directed this were very bright or were trying to come up with something interesting.  It's not really my thing, but it's a lot of fun, especially with the children running around and the "fugly" children having a bad time in a small town.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the old, classic '50s TV series, "The Love Boat."   It aired for a total of eight seasons between 1969 and 1979.   One episode was in 1977 and it was the most amazing episode I have seen in a long time.  I was 9 years old at the time and a few of the things I remember most is all the old people.  The actors were all good in this and I think it was good for people of my age to see it in the original format instead of the remake.  One thing about the series is it was never shown in color.  There were black and white versions for some of the episodes that were broadcast but it is just not good enough.  But I do think this is still one of my favorite tv shows.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When we meet Max, he's at a high school graduation celebration and his mother (Julia Roberts) takes him away to live with her and her husband (John Travolta) after Max leaves the military. Max has a rough time adjusting to the military life; he's not very friendly with his new friends, gets in trouble a lot, but that's the life he chose. Max and his friend Joe (Peter Ustinov) are good at their job; they're very good at making the most of a good thing. I was reminded of "The Hunt For Red October" a lot: the young heroes have to protect a beautiful woman and the most brilliant spy in history.  This was definitely a movie that has stood the test of time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is one of those strange stories that makes you think you're watching something really cool. It's a little long and the ending is a little stupid. However, it's definitely not an ordinary short film, it has some clever things going on and at times is genuinely funny. It was also filmed during the day, so it's a bit strange but well worth seeing if you're interested in short films. I would have liked to see some more things from the film, like more of the little characters in a strange environment and more of a plot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very well produced film that takes the reader and the reader's imaginations, in this case in terms of dreams, into the unknown.  The characters and the story are good, and the setting is wonderful.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is interesting to see how the two-dimensional villain, who was a huge hit in his movie debut, is reduced to nothing but a minor character (and this for an audience that probably watched this to see the villain played by Kevin Spacey). This is not to say that this is bad; it is actually fairly entertaining, although it is hard to believe that Spacey's character isn't more in line with the kind of people that would like him to be. This would certainly help his chances with women (which he never had) and would certainly improve his chances of getting into movies. If this is going to be Spacey going back to playing villainous roles, well, I am not sure how that will play out. His performance is not bad, but it sure is not that great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a lot of fun. I know it seems like the opposite but this was a really cool movie.  It's based on a really interesting premise:   The United States government has been using a mind altering drug called "Trance" to control the people.    It's a good idea:  They put it on television so we can have a "trip" in which we experience the same things we would have if we were under the effects of the drug.  It turns out that all the government's "psyches" (mind-altering drugs) are working as intended:  We see a beautiful blue sky. We get to do things that "normal" people wouldn't do: we have sex with the same woman.  We have sex in a room that looks like a spaceship from the future.  A lot of the film is set in this room.  But all of the characters are normal-looking people who have been turned into robots by the drug:    We see this happen to a young boy named John. John's father (Steve Buscemi) is an alcoholic who never seems to get to enjoy his "lives."  John seems normal but he's actually a robot.  He's only alive because the drug makes him believe it's living things living like real people:  After he has sex in the spaceship-room, he begins to hallucinate.  And there's one more thing:  This movie is a parody of "The Matrix"   But the thing is, I didn't see anything funny about it:  It has a funny premise.  I got a little confused about how they were actually getting around to making people believe the drugs were real:  But even if they're using the same trick, I don't see them getting it all right:  What I find so amusing is that it's like this drug is the mind-alasing technology of the future:  One day they're going to let us go into a room we could actually go into and it's going to be like a "space" where we can experience the life that we would otherwise miss:  "I don't want you to be a robot; I want you," his father says, "to be yourself."   Then we meet John:  John was born at the same time as Steve Buscemis. He has a little sister named Molly. But John can't really talk because he
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is just a great movie, it's not great because it's a good film, it is great because of the quality of the actors and the great story telling. I don't know why I never really liked the character of Lotte Isel. I just couldn't get into it. It was all very contrived and just too boring and the acting was always a little bit off. I think my favorite part of the movie was the end when the kids go on a ride in a motorboat with the old man who has been in the boat for so long that they start to feel like they are riding in a river. I hope they made a sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very darkly satirical thriller about a young woman who, after a series of horrible events, is finally able to kill a serial killer. Unfortunately, that killer, a man in his late thirties, is just as bad a character as she is. He is a pathological liar and seems to have a lot of time on his hands.   I enjoyed this film with all my heart.   of course, it is not for everybody, but the darkly humorous mood and the fact that you see the killer and his crimes on film does not hurt.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's a lot of great movie-like stuff in this movie--it's a combination of everything that was great about the previous two films. A good story, lots of interesting characters, and a thrilling action sequence that will thrill anybody who enjoyed the previous movies. The cast is full of likable, interesting characters in a cast with all the talent you'd expect from an Edgar Rice Burroughs science fiction tale. If only there was a way to get it onto DVD!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed 'The Long Strange Trip', which is a very atmospheric film about a man who sees an ominous cloud heading towards his home in the north. A storm that he must out-run. His home is a haunted hotel - an old one, not modern. But this man knows that something is there - something very important - and he must find out what it is. There is a great atmosphere and some well done scares. Well done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As far as this movie is concerned, I think that it is a bit too long.   It took me a good twenty minutes to get through it and when I think of it, the whole time I thought that I could see a few more minutes cut, but then I remembered that this is a film made back in 1929, about three friends who are looking for a job.  I just wish it had been a little shorter. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've always loved to watch Hitchcock movies and I'm a big fan of Hitchcock. I didn't really get to see the movie, but I'll be watching it now. The movie is actually very interesting, I'm looking forward to see if they make a sequel. I'll admit, I didn't expect to like this one a whole lot. I like that they got a bit more creative with the art design for the film, but it still feels like a typical Hitchcock film. What made it stand out to me was the acting, and especially the performances of the two main actors, Richard Harris and Joan Fontaine. Even though he is so well known and admired, Harris still does an exceptional job as Jack, and Joan is so charming in her role as Miss Maud. I hope that this film will be more popular than the one it's based on, and it still holds up quite well.

It's a great story about a girl who finds out that she has been cursed with a talent she never knew she had... she can see things in the dark... the only good thing about this movie is the acting, though most of it was cheesy (which is what the majority of old school horror is, anyway).

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This one is one of the most interesting and fun horror movies ever!  If you enjoyed the movies "Gremlins", "The Grudge", "Grosse Pointe Blank" you will love this one!  The movie is based on a novel by Stephen King called, "The Mist". The movie was made in 1989.  There were many sequels and a new series called "The Dukes of Hazzard"   The story is based upon a man named, "H.P." (Henry Prejean).  Henry is a writer and an editor.  He has a wife and a daughter.  H.P. loves writing, and he writes a lot.  His wife Mary (Mary Woronov) was a very beautiful woman.  During a trip to the desert with his daughter, she fell ill and the doctors say the worst is yet to come.  Henry and his wife leave on a week long vacation.  On the plane, Mary becomes very ill.  The doctor wants her to go to a hospital, but H. P. refuses.  Instead, he stays in the cabin and tries to help his sick wife.  While they are in the desert, Henry sees an apparition of a man in a white robe who tells him, "Mary has been bitten by a rattlesnake."  H P. tries to take care of his wife and child.  In the hospital, the doctors find a bite mark on Mary.  She has been poisoned!  Henry finds out that Mary has been drugged and has become delusional.  After a trip back home, H.A.B. (Henry's wife) tells H.p. she loves him.  But Henry and Mary are forced to take an airplane back to New York.  "The Mothman" is a movie made by one of Stephen King's most trusted friends, William Peter Blatty.  It's a very good movie.    A very good horror movie, I give it a 9 out of 10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies that you have to see in its entirety to be able to enjoy it. It is a very well acted, well written movie; and it will give you a good laugh or two. There is a wonderful score that gives it a very "movie soundtrack" feel to it. But all that is not enough to make this one truly a worthy film. It was written by a guy who has not seen or heard of many of the classic film noir films of the 1950s and early 60s. A good film noire film does not need all the bells and whistles it's got. The movie is quite good, though it lacks some of the flair of its more well known forerunner, "Dirty Harry." It does well, however, at telling a story that is somewhat unique. There's a lot of crime in this movie and the police are a bit overwhelmed. That does not make it any less of a good crime story. The action scenes are well acted and the story line makes a strong case that cops and robbers should never meet. The whole thing looks very modern, and the costumes, with their bright colors, are very pretty. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have just recently finished a 3 day film festival, which consisted of a few dozen films of varying genres and eras. I was quite pleased to be among the filmmakers of my generation. The films are often of very high quality and are certainly not to be missed. I must add that I do not understand this statement "there's a lot of nudity in this movie". I have to tell the director I will definitely not go near this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to agree with the other reviews, this was a really good movie. The plot was simple enough and the characters were likable. There weren't a ton of "wtf" moments and I would guess this is just the type of movie people like when they're bored.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't normally watch movies where women play the villain so this was a pleasant surprise. The bad guy is portrayed by a great Chris Hemsworth in an equally good lead role. The chemistry between the two is excellent. The plot is the usual superhero story that you'll find in most comics. The only thing that kept this from being a perfect film was that the final fight scene had some pretty terrible choreography.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is entertaining and action-packed and not to mention it's got a really memorable cast of characters (which was mostly from the 60s and 70s) all of which are in it because they can (or are forced by the situation).  They all have a unique look, and the cinematography is superb and all of the costumes are wonderfully detailed, to the point where the film looks like a great vintage black and white film from the 70s.  I can't imagine it looked as pretty today and I hope they made a remake.   This movie is an absolute must see!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was made in 1932 when most people were still living in the country. It was a good adaptation of a book about an Indian couple who moved into a country house and who have to learn English.  My friend said she liked the movie but she thought the director should have made the character of the Indian more realistic. This movie had some beautiful Indian music and was a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is based on a book by Christopher Isherwood about an eccentric, but well-intentioned man who is a member of a secret society called The Church of the Big Muddy in the Catskills. The group meets in the woods to practice hunting the moose, with the goal of killing the enormous creature at night. And the thing about moose is that when they are ready to kill, they run so fast that they are like lightning. This is a very effective metaphor for how the world behaves and a great piece of work from one of the best screenwriters in the business, even if the film itself is just average. I found the idea that Isherwoods was really "into the wilderness" a little overstated (maybe it was because of how often he is in it), but I was impressed by the performance of his father, a local fisherman who seems to be a bit crazy. I also thought the character of The Big Mudd had an interesting idea: if you can't kill a moose in the dark and in the rain, you have to start killing them at night in the shadows where the mooses can't follow you. I did find it odd, though, that the film ends before the film actually starts. This might be an issue for some viewers, but it didn't bother me in the least. I think that the title might be one that a lot of people, especially those who have never seen this sort of movie, might mistake for a bad joke, but in truth it is one of those rare films that could actually be used for an extended family comedy. I would recommend it, and I would even suggest that it be shown on Sundays, at least as a Christmas film. And, of course, I have yet to see a film as good as this one in a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one is a great little film with some nice special effects, and it's one of the most unique pieces of science fiction that we've ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I met at our church. We have been married 19 years and live in the same apartment.  We decided to get married because we couldn't decide if we should go out in our car or a car with a convertible top.  The convertible top had a problem: the top was only a little bit off center.  In order to fix this, I had to go out to my garage and get a large ball (I don't have a fancy machine and can't do a good job, so I do it by hand).  Then I got out a piece of heavy duty plywood.  With the ball on the ground, I took the wood, rolled it over a 1/4 inch thick block of wood and took it to my wife who had not been out yet.  She gave it a good tug on the back and it went in.  Then we set it on the lawn and walked around for a while.  After about 45 minutes, we went back to the car.  And the top still didn't work.  So I put a ball back on my yard, rolled the wood over it and took a step back.  It worked perfectly.   I never have had a convertible at our place.  I used a good quality piece of plywood which can easily withstand a lot of abuse. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the late 80's a directorial debut by a young Danish writer and actress called Helene Thiemann. I thought the whole movie was very funny, but the only problem I had was that I couldnt believe I had seen a movie that wasn't really worth seeing.   The plot:  A young blonde girl (the heroine) goes to visit her father, who has gone to stay in a big mansion. At the same time a man comes to the house for the purpose of getting a "lady in waiting" for his daughter. He goes there dressed as a woman.  What's so funny here?  It is quite obvious to anyone who really looks at the film that this film is trying to parody the mores of the time.  One thing to note:  The name 'Ladies in Waiting' sounds eery and   funny:  As far as I was concerned this film was a waste of a good laugh, and that is saying a lot.  Another criticism I had about this movie is that it is about as long as a book, and I'm sure that it would make a nice Christmas Eve present for my kid.  So what do I think of the film?  The dialogue is good; I'm not quite sure if they were really trying to write jokes or not.  The setting, the costumes, and the camera are all a good fit with the time period.  There is a lot of good dialogue and jokes that work.  If this was a film made about the '80s I think it would probably be about a bunch of   women who dress as men and hang out in mansions. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very fun, funny movie that is very well made and well acted. The plot is so great that at a first viewing I thought I would have a hard time believing the story even though it is based on a true story. That was not the case at all. However, in a short two hour running time it does enough to keep the interest of anyone who has a sense of humor. The character of Johnny Carson has a nice story that is both entertaining and a bit macabre. The movie is a comedy so there is not a lot of hard hitting violence, but you get a lot more than you expect. When the story is finished there is a good ending that makes you feel good about watching the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my opinion this is a movie you can see and watch over and over.   This is a great movie about the Vietnam war.  It is very well done in all aspects. The sound is great.  When you think that we are getting on for 30 years, you are wrong.  I watched this movie a few years after the war ended.  A lot of the people in it seem to live in the memories. The movie is an excellent film about Vietnam and the people there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love how a film so full of life, color and humor can still be so thoughtful. The film is set in rural Tennessee, just outside of Nashville (though a little further south) and it's home to an entire population of blue eyed folk who speak a unique dialect that is completely different from any other dialect I have heard before. The Blue-Eyed folk love their music (some pretty weird) and their art is just as great as they talk. Their lifestyle is very different than ours, and it is full of mystery and magic, and people who get away with murder! I just love this film, I think it is a timeless film that every young teen should watch, but I would warn anyone who's a bit younger about the things that they will see: I know one person who saw it when he was 14, and now he has an addiction to blue eyed people and music! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those films that makes you think that they would want to make a sequel! They would like to do that a lot. I'm not saying this is one, but it certainly is one in my opinion. A solid, yet not perfect, film that has a great ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has a great story that was quite original and well executed. The film does a good job of setting up the mystery and building suspense as the mystery takes some time to be solved. The movie takes a few liberties with reality as the characters are almost all people who know each other but not personally. It also has a lot of nudity. The nudity in this movie is pretty good considering the time period it was made. It was a pretty good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was born in the 70's, so to me, when the 70s were good, they were good (with the occasional exception of the disco era - and all that noise about drugs). I was lucky enough to see the original Superman, and I was instantly struck by the character (and I loved the idea of a kid from Kansas who could fly around, and use his abilities to save the day).   The first movie, I thought, could really work if the producers made some minor changes (most importantly, the fact that the guy from Krypton (Kirk Alyn) ended up dying and Lois and the other girls have to get over it quickly and forget about it.   Alyn didn't have quite the same character as the original, so in this movie, Clark (now a millionaire) decides to go to a planet that was once home to a people who look exactly like the original Kryptonians - and a pretty girl named Tasha, played by a very young Linda Hamilton.  This film features great special effects (especially the one of Superman landing on a building with an enormous wing).  For some reason, this film never got a sequel.  But then, that doesn't mean this is a bad movie - it was fun and a good use of special effects, and the plot is simple enough.  I enjoyed the comic reliefs, and I found the girl actors to be pretty good too.  It was never really a bad film, just a weird one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is what you want in a summer movie.  It's got a bunch of fun people hanging out and enjoying their time on a sunny beach, all of them having a good time.  A very good movie, and a nice little adventure of a day for the four of them.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was raised by two mothers and I was one of those children that they would take out in the field on a hot summer's day to shoot squirrels. I was about 5 years old when it all began. We lived in the countryside at that time. On one of these days a little boy and his mother were out in one of the fields on their own. The mother was just about to be caught, so she put her hand to her forehead in a panic. As soon as she did the boy turned on the spot and started running as fast as he could. At that moment a squirrel hit him on the nose, and with a little effort the boy pulled his head off the ground. He looked up at his mother and said "I can't live any longer. I'm afraid I'm going to fall dead." She ran over to him and tried to pull him out of the ground but he wouldn't budge. Then she grabbed his leg, and that was the end of the little boy. The little boy had to be removed by the doctor, and the doctor's name was Doctor Kincaid. As for the mother, she was just as shocked and frightened, and she gave the child back to his mother with an affectionate slap. That was the beginning. (from the book The Little Boy Who Lived: The True Story of Doctor K.C.I.)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. I thought that this was going to be a disaster, but the actors do a decent job. The direction is fine, but there are times when it is rather obvious that the cameraman has an axe to grind. When there are a lot of explosions, the cameramen are standing there, taking the film's perspective, trying to show the destruction. Also, when the villain is in the center of the scene, the audience is not allowed to see his face. It is just too obvious that he is there because he wants to destroy the hero (and to be fair, it is kind of fun that the hero does not realize he has been beaten). That being said, this film is not as good as the previous ones: this is a good effort, but not a great one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are several reasons why this movie is a must-see: a) For its realistic portrayal of a real-life disaster.   I saw it the other day and the whole time I felt very real when I saw a live body.  This movie is so realistic and powerful that even when you have a good laugh, you must know what you are laughing at.  As an expert in the field of human disaster movies, it is an honor to have been involved in a film that depicts such a true depiction of human misery, such as the one that occurred in Tainan Province, China on September 10, 1972.  I am also glad to have the opportunity to work with my great friend, the legendary Peter Billingsley (Mr. Big), whose skills are evident from his other films (such as "Lionheart", "Strip Tease" and "King Kong").   Peter makes you understand why we, humans, need to be afraid and why a man can die with dignity.  My only regret is that we could not have had more time to shoot this movie.  - Paul H. Fain You can't get any closer to real life than the Tainancin disaster. - Peter Billingley The first thing that strikes you when you see a live dog being slaughtered is the sheer horror of the thing. - Paul Fain This movie was very exciting to make and was also exciting to watch. - Tom W.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My second visit to the U.S. with the kids (who were 6 at the time, and who were a little too young to ride a bicycle to school). We stopped at the movie palace on U.F.O. and I bought a popcorn with the dollar I made (about $1.00). It was a good popcorn. The action sequences were very well done. Some of the special effects were not very realistic. It may have seemed like we were seeing a movie in real life. There was much talk about the fact that this was a re-make of the movie "The Day the Earth Stood Still". Not very convincing to me, but I watched it. We then took the kids to the zoo where we saw a large number of creatures (the lion was very large). I think a great movie. We all enjoyed it and I am sure my son will enjoy it as well. It made me wish I was born during this time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the all time greats, and a masterpiece of a story. It starts out quite bleak and un-pleasant...and this does not even cover it! The movie goes a lot of ways to trying to make you like the protagonist...he gets lost in the woods with the "ghost of a man" who he seems to see about once a year. They run into the ghosts of a couple (who were married when the ghosts appeared...I'm sure you know) who have been murdered in front of their young daughter...and the woman is being threatened...they are all very strange...and so is the girl (her hair is very spooky and dark)...but it was all in an attempt to scare the poor girl and to get the man in the cabin that is being hunted by the police to turn himself in! This has not only been made into a movie...it is a masterpiece, and the acting, especially by Paul Newman, is superb...it's all so weird and scary!   The plot is really weird...it almost makes no sense and is somewhat disturbing and disturbing at the same time! I have never seen anything like this! It is really creepy and makes one think that this ghost is very much like a bad nightmare! This would be a great movie for Halloween or just for someone who likes a good ghost story!  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a must-see if you like action, suspense, explosions, and the usual suspects in the most outlandish circumstances.  The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. N.W.O. (National World War II Organization), a super-spy who's tasked by the top secret government organization to recruit an anti-Nazi super-soldier (Bruce Lee) to help defeat Hitler.   While trying to find the perfect assassin who has everything it takes to win the war, the N.O.'s find the one man that can't even handle his own weapon, so he has to be hired by Mr. T.P. (Bruce Willis) as backup while he and the other "super-spies" (i.e. Bruce Lee's son) head out to the German homeland.  The film's action is great, the special effects are great, and both the acting and the dialogue are great.  If you enjoy action, you will enjoy this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A must see for anyone looking for a cheap thrill:  It is almost impossible to get people to sit still on the street or in the park while a motorcade is rolling by. A few minutes later, when the car is almost out of sight, the movie switches to a newsreel in which they are interviewing a policeman who has been attacked in the line of duty. This is a typical western, very long, very loud, and almost totally devoid of dialog. The police officer is the only good character in the film; all the others are either criminals or losers.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot is really dumb in the first half (and the last), but it gets better in the second half. It has a very fun action sequence where a group of kids go to space and get captured by giant space aliens. In a lot of ways, the action sequence is a direct parody of the Spaceballs episode. The only thing you have to compare this scene to is the one in the episode "The Space Race". In this one, a kid's parents, who are supposed to be space aliens, get into a space ship which is apparently supposed to go to orbit around some planet, but it really ends up hanging out for a while and getting captured by the aliens. After a bunch of jokes about how the aliens look like the characters from the episode The Space Race, the crew gets away. The thing that makes this scene funny is how stupid it is and how the kids just keep getting sucked into the ship until they are captured by aliens. But the funny part is how in this case the kids are in the right, they are being kidnapped by an alien species which looks exactly like their parents. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It took the usual trappings of a B-movie (one of the worst I've ever seen in my life) and turned them upside down. In a movie that would have fit right in at any number of other low-budget 'horror' films, John Carpenter (John Milius of 'Revenge of the Nerds' fame) produced a masterfully-directed horror film that was simultaneously hilarious and horrifying. It was like the greatest horror movie you'll ever see. John Mili This was a brilliant film. What I really liked was the fact that it showed you how to survive in a strange, strange world. I never thought I could survive anything so I definitely liked this movie. If you're looking to see a good, cheap but extremely well-produced B-horror movie then look no further. John Carpenter is truly a genius director! And, if you don't know who John Miliar is, he is a writer/director who has worked with the likes of "Beware the Man," "The Grinch," "Wag The Dog" and the like. This is one of those B-movies that will make you wonder who's really the most scary guy in the room!    A wonderful, terrifying B-Movie, one that was perfect for Halloween!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be perfectly honest I have never watched this movie till recently. I have a big problem to explain why I really like this movie but I will try.   I think the biggest thing about this movie is that it is a film about the true story of a real American hero.  This hero was named Billy the Kid (1925-1946) a man named George Gass (1902-1979) from Kansas, a poor boy who was born in a poor family and who grew up to be a very good fighter.  Billy has an older brother and a younger sister. In his early years he worked at a lumber yard to get a better life then his own. In later years he became a farmer, but unfortunately it was not long before he suffered a serious injury and spent a long time in a blind camp.  When he finally came of age in his late 30s he decided to follow his dreams of a professional fighter and after many fights he had to face his death at the age of 36.  So after his untimely death his brother and sister decide to go and live in the mountains, and so they took up the name of the Great Black Snake.  For over 100 years the Great Snake lived a life full of adventure and adventure began and ended in the desert. The Snake loved animals and loved life.  They lived in the great Black Desert and over the years the Snake made many friends.  He also made enemies.  One of the first enemies he came to the attention of was the great evil wizard Zorro (1928-1980), who sent the wicked wizard named Zorz to capture the Snake and bring him to Zorrro who was living in another dimension.  After a long battle the Snake is saved from Zorru and taken back to his own dimension and lives happily ever after.  But over the next 100 years Zorzz had many times threatened to capture Billy.  The Snake however always made it home for dinner and enjoyed a good cold drink.  In this movie he has the opportunity to return to his home dimension to take revenge on Zorrrz.  However when he and his friends visit the Great Desert they find an old man who tells them the story of Zorzo and the Black Desert.  It is from this that this movie gets it name.  To read more about the history of the desert read The Black Desert by David Stannard.  A few other things: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've never heard any bad reviews about A Good Night  to the end.  It's a movie about a group of people who are celebrating a good time in their old home town when a series of horrible happenings happen.  The film is filmed in the style of a 1950's Western with some scenes reminiscent of The Wild Bunch. The acting is top notch and the cinematography is quite good.  Overall, A Goodnight is an enjoyable movie.  I would recommend it to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would not recommend this movie to anyone. First off I don't like the title for it seems to describe a real person who lived a terrible life. I mean really, the man must have been so angry he would not sleep or eat for days at a time, constantly going on wild benders. When his friends started telling him about a famous Hollywood movie he decided to try to make it for them. All he really had to do was rent a trailer and go to a location and that was all. There were plenty of people in the trailer. Everyone in the movie was a crazy person or did something a crazy way. And they all behaved themselves. They were like living in a weird carnival. The movie is terrible but even so, it is funny. The acting is horrible. If anyone saw it once, even once, maybe twice, it would stay in your mind forever. If you don't mind people in your head that long... The worst part is the dialogue. It is like they were doing impressions of themselves. Like all movies that have people saying their lines you can tell when people are talking about themselves in a funny way. It really does not work. I don?t think I even like this movie. It has no substance, no characters, and no plot. It seems like a complete joke and I don??t recommend it. It was only shown once in the country in the summer of 1984. I hope that they will put this on again someday but they should not have put a movie like this out, especially because it has a silly title.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was totally caught off guard by this movie and the ending is really cool.   The movie is a straight rip-off of a good horror movie by the same director (Tom DeSanto) and the film has a very nice ending.  It starts off by showing a man walking down a deserted road. As he passes the woods where a strange figure lurks, the figure walks towards him. The man is terrified of the figure. He can't take his eyes off the figure as it walks toward him and it looks right at him.  The thing is, this creature doesn't look like it is trying to hurt the man. It looks like it wants him dead. It walks right past him and as it does, a voice says, "I'll get you one day son, one day."   After the voice says that the man looks at his watch. It turns out that the voice is that of a cop trying to convince a young man to come down to the station to talk about a crime he committed. He is afraid to talk to the cop, because it will mean admitting to being a bad person. The young man is hesitant, but agrees to come. The cop also warns him that if he doesn't come down tonight, he will be in jail.  I would like to give this a solid rating, but there is one thing I would've changed, and it is in the beginning.  The first few minutes of the film were great.  In the scene where the cop tries to get the kid to come to the police station, the kid looks up at the sky and the creature begins walking in the shadows towards him (as the cop walks with his eyes closed). The creature is a very creepy looking creature and the young man looks away from it, but it seems as if he is in fact scared by it. This is a good start to the movie.  Then the film goes down a dark and scary path.  A few minutes in the film, we meet a young girl named Sarah (Rosemarie DeWitt), and she has a terrible and horrible past.  Her father and her mother both died in a car accident.  There is no explanation on why or who, or what happened to her parents, only that they both died. There is nothing we can do about it, because they died as a result of a terrible accident that the family had when they were young. Sarah was the only child left in
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I read my review about the first installment of the series, I had to say "Oh No! Not another one!". This film is not only a good film, but has some wonderful moments and some great, powerful, and moving performances. The cinematography is wonderful, the acting is superb, and the story is pretty terrific, too. There is a lot of action, a lot to think about, and a lot about the human heart... I'm sure we'll be seeing more and more of this movie before too long... and it just might be one of those rare movies that people will enjoy and watch over and over again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For a movie that doesn't contain a single real superhero or character, the one of the most beloved heroines of the 80's, the most influential pop songwriter of the 40's and the one who made the movies, she was the most powerful character in the most famous movie of the 70's and a big part of the 90's.  But despite all the amazing moments, and the fact that the movies didn't get an award at the Oscars, the girl still remains the most unforgettable heroine ever.  I mean, we all loved her as one of our favorite girls in school and in middle school, and after seeing her for a minute in the movie, we knew it: she was our favorite character.   She wasn't the main character, but she never felt like one of those typical heroines in that "cool, mysterious, mysterious princess" movie, she wasn't that interesting, she didn't have a lot of superpowers (unless you count a great wardrobe, that's all), but at the same time, she just had a heart that couldn't be broken no matter what.  She's so pure and simple, yet so strong.  The movies were like the best memories of teenage years in all of our lives: we watched them over and over again, we watched these movies with our friends, we got drunk together, we cried together, and we always knew she would be the one to take our souls again.  And that was her story, so let's make the best of it! (review written by an old guy, don't get confused by the bad English :p)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is one of those "crazier" films in terms of how weird it is. The movie opens in some small town in Maine. Everyone is getting together for a "Rock-a-Roll Revival" in a local club. There is a huge crowd, but, well, I don't really remember much. There are a few jokes here and there and a few different costumes. This is pretty much a fun comedy about a bunch of goofs who are trying to be famous. The biggest laugh comes when a guy tells a lady to call his wife, but instead gives her his number. There was a bit that was very funny: There's a guy wearing a white robe that's very dark and then he's not there and no one has any idea where he was. The audience was definitely entertained.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a great comedy. The movie starts off by showing one of those bad-guy-movie-in-a-small-town movie-clips. There are only two good guys in this movie, and they are the best buddies. The first guy that is shown is the goodie-two-shoes, Johnny Carson. He is always looking out for the best interests of his buddy, and this guy is good. He gets all the chicks. All of them. Even the girls that are "not-so-good". It is a love-it-or-leave-it kind of movie. This movie does not have a plot. What it does have is a lot of love and laughter. There were also a lot people involved in the movie and most of them were not of high quality. It is an entertaining movie. But that doesn't mean it is a good one.

If you've seen it and are thinking that this is a bad film that isn't worth your time, well, think again. It's a good film that shows the world that life goes on in the best of ways and there are even happier moments that were put on display in The Black Widow. For a time, I loved it. In fact, my wife loved it and said that it was the most entertaining film she had ever seen.

The blacksmith is a man of some intelligence and is able to fix many things with the tools he possesses. He has a family and a wife and children, and a house, which he has been building. He is also quite a hero and is always ready to help. This movie is a must-see for blacks who don't go to the theater very often.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to agree with all other reviewers. This is a well made movie that is funny, violent, sad and at the same time the most touching film. I don't know why the American critics failed to find a funny or entertaining enough in the movie. The story of a girl who moves to a small town is very real. The fact that the little town has been devastated and the new girl has become a target of the gang, is not a joke but very real and the girl is so vulnerable and afraid that even the gang have to help her escape. It is very effective in making the audience think about the consequences of what they do. I am impressed by the performances of all the actors. It's really nice to watch the gang trying their best to be the good guys in this movie.    A very good movie with a very sad end.

I was able to see it at a private showing at a local theater, which was a treat. Not sure if it is a good film, but it is well produced, and if it was a good book, it would be an interesting read.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the world of big budget superhero movies there is usually a big payoff to make a movie worth seeing. The first one does not disappoint in this regard, so far there is some pretty fun action, great costumes and an awesome villain. The second one is more of a science fiction movie and as such is a little more on the light side as it is quite funny. The action is good, the movie has a nice soundtrack, it does have a very good cast and it is one of the better action films out there. There are a number of sequels out there but I can't recommend this one highly enough. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you're a fan of American comedy, then you'll love this classic.  Even though the cast and crew are funny, and they manage to make this film funny, it is an incredibly well-done comedy that has no weaknesses, no dull moments, it doesn't leave you feeling bored, nor does it leave you wanting more.        I highly recommend this movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It will be very difficult to make the next one: it does not really have the character of the first one - it's really like a more polished version, with the same kind of humor and the same plot structure, but that's not a bad thing.   I don't think that this one is really all that different from the first.  "
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film has great performances that range from believable to laughable. And yet, I found myself rooting for it. This is the kind of film that is hard to watch and will make you laugh at the absurdity and the "weirdness." It's like a cross between 'Caddyshack' and 'Hoosiers', but at a much more extreme and grotesque level. If there's a future for this kind of movies I certainly hope there's one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A few movies later, the movie got its first serious acting job. I was more impressed than I thought I would be. And that's saying alot since I didn't think there was any of it in the original.    A couple of days ago, I was in a bad mood. I felt bad for the people who work in that factory. They must have been getting the most monotonous, repetitive, depressing jobs ever to live. They all look so tired, and they work so long, and then they go home. And then there's the other workers. There's only one of them who doesn't sit all day staring out the window. He's usually with the guy who drives the dump truck. That guy has to be on the job for four days and every four days he comes home. I don't know why they think it's necessary to keep that guy on. He probably gets up at three in the morning to make money. I mean, I'm in a better mood than he is right now.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   As the title implies, it is a movie that portrays the life of a poor Indian family and its efforts to survive in the face of prejudice from everyone around them.   The film features a strong lead character, played by Manoj Bajpayee, a young man from a humble background.  His father is a tailor, and his mother is an illiterate woman. They are also a couple of alcoholic parents.  One of the things that set Manoj apart from the rest of his family is a deep and abiding interest in philosophy.   He loves to study philosophy and also to participate in discussions about it.  In one of his lectures, he is introduced to the Indian guru, Swami Vivekananda.  One day, when his father goes to the grocery store, Manoj decides to stay home and read philosophical books.  He becomes so absorbed in philosophical speculation that he forgets to buy milk for himself or his mother.  After this event, both of his parents give up their jobs and come to live with him.  Despite this, he has many friends, who treat him as a favorite.  Manoj's mother is still illiterate. Her only skill is that she is a good cook.  Unfortunately for her, she is in great need of work to get enough money to support her family. Manoj is determined to help his mother find a job. But how will he do it?   His mother is a very bright, articulate young woman. She is the epitome of a person who is willing to learn and adapt to any situation. Manaj does all that he can to help her, even if he needs his own hands to do it.   Manoj knows something about philosophy and he is an outstanding student, who is very dedicated in his studies. At the same time, he also knows the power of education to change lives.  The thing that makes Manoj such a good character is that he is the antithesis of the kind of person who would become successful in Indian society.  As we see in the film, even with a background as a cook, he takes very pride in his profession of serving food. He knows a lot about how to make food palatable to a large audience, which is why he is such a success in his chosen profession.  But in real life, most people with a family do not have the luxury of having their work depend on their own personal knowledge.    They have to use their
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you liked The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, you will like the movie The Mummies of Giza. You will find an old fashioned adventure flick where the young hero embarks on a dangerous quest that results in a great number of interesting and sometimes surprising adventures.  If nothing else, this film is well made with good acting and good special effects.   The film opens with a young boy playing a toy train on the banks of the Nile. It then cuts to a jungle in Egypt where two people are dancing on the edge of a cliff. In the foreground we see a large elephant trying to break its fall. It breaks, and a young man riding a donkey tries to save his master. However, the donkey is no match for the elephant and the donkey ends up rolling off a cliff instead. The two men are rescued, but one of them is missing a leg. After some searching, the other man is found, his leg is now missing.  The hero of the film is a young Indian boy who, when he is about eight, is sent on a journey by his grandmother to visit her father's tomb in Egypt.  ( I had only seen the trailer and a little of the trailers for The Mumm:    I didn't know much about The Munchkin or The Mumbo Jumbo.  It appears to be a re-telling of The Murchin and I do not like this re-discovery of the old fairy tale.  There were no other reviews available for this movie on IMDB so I am posting one for the web. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be honest, after the first two minutes, I was afraid that this would not end well. And yes, that's the name of the movie; but it was a very good movie. I have been watching action movies lately that are like the movies from the early 70's. I think that it's a time of decline for Hollywood. I've seen more good action than bad ones lately. The movie had so much action and it was entertaining too. In fact, it was good all the way through. The characters all seemed to be real and relatable. There was no one character that felt like a bad guy. I'd say that this movie has an awesome story, so make sure you get that. It may not be as good as a "Gunsmoke" episode, but it sure is entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie so much it might have taken me a couple weeks to get through it all. The movie had so many twists and turns and it was great to see such an old-fashioned movie, filled with good jokes and nice singing.   The plot involved a man named Charlie who would sneak out to his neighbor's house, but not in the middle of the night. The neighbors did not like that and made Charlie leave. One day, Charlie stumbles upon a giant dinosaur skull, and he and his friend find out that the skull is inhabited by a monster called Bambi, who has been haunting the neighborhood ever since the boy that discovered it died. Charlie and his friends find out a way to bring Bambili back, which would mean that there are only two Bambillas left in the world.  This movie is not as good as Jurassic Park, but it is still good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As far as "bombs and bullets, bullets and more bullets" goes, this movie delivers in spades. And in a way that makes it a lot like your favorite video game - except a bit more dangerous.  I have a lot of respect for director Steven Seagal, who has worked with some of the biggest movie stars of all time. He has done several action movies in the last 15 years, and has done so with some great performances, and great directing. So I was a bit skeptical about this movie when I saw it. But I am glad I saw Steven Seyal's action movie, because it is pretty damn awesome, and very realistic - so much so that I kind of wish the movie had been made in real life.  (hide spoiler)   "This ain't no martial arts movie, it's a war movie and if you ain't ready to die you can leave right now." So the movie is set a few months after the war has ended, and a bunch of the American marines who were on the way to the Middle East for some reason are returning to U.S., and are confronted with the reality that most of what they fought and bled for was a lie...and a bunch more than a few dead. So they decide to go back into the jungle, to "get some rations" and then go home again. , which is like one of those movies where the hero (a retired general and the head of a company that owns many of the bases where the marines spend a lot time) gets a small part in the main plot and gets involved in something dangerous - but not enough for the main villain, who is a Russian colonel who's an old enemy who somehow got into his company's quarters and stole some explosives and guns, and is about to kill everyone who is still alive. But before he does anything of the sort, he does a bit of research, and gets information from "a guy" whom he believes to be a retired general, because of the way he's acting - but which actually turns out to be one of the Russian generals. So the general is taken hostage, and the movie starts.So the movie has a lot to recommend it: (view spoiler) There's a lot going on in this movie - and Steven Seegal's acting is awesome. He plays it all very believable, and you don't feel like you're watching a video game made in the 1990s. I

This is the last of the "Seven Samurai" in my opinion.  What I love about this movie is the very well-done story line.  There are some interesting dialogue that has you thinking but the film itself is a bit slow, but it's still a good film.  And one final note about the cast:  Most of the actors play pretty much identical roles so it doesn't matter if you like them or not, but I think they all have a good time together.  A fun movie and I give it an 8 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The other day, the cast of Star Trek Into Darkness was on stage for a press junket to promote the new movie, when the director spoke to us and discussed the importance of making the characters feel real.  He then began to talk about a few of the actors and actresses who were part of the Star Trek family.   He mentioned, for example, that Jonathan Frakes was really close to Brent Spiner and Marina Sirtis.    He also spoke about the fact that the director was really excited about this movie.  The cast of the new Star Trek movie are: Chris Pine  Patrick Stewart  Kirk  Spock  McCoy  Chekov  Sulu  Yelton    This new Starfleet movie is really awesome!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to say this was a great movie, it was not a good flick but was better than most films in the same genre like the late '70s. It was fun, and one of those classic comedy romp films. There is a lot of humor, lots of gags, lots a jokes, and that is not too bad. I thought it was one of the funniest comedies in a long time. It is a great comedy and a must see for any fan of comedy. I will most certainly be going out of my way to watch more of this movie. It makes a great gift or movie date, but I suggest you watch it first, cause it is good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is pretty much as good as it sounds. The production is decent, but there aren't any real effects to speak of, but the whole thing feels a little cheesy. I know it's supposed to be about a big truck crash and the car drivers, but it just comes across as one huge "well, it's a TV show, right?" That being said, there's enough great action scenes to hold the viewer's interest. And at the very least, it doesn't feel like a "what have you done for me lately" movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original Ghostbusters is a hilarious, hilarious film with the original voice cast (minus Bill Murray) who don't mess around.  Their gags about how "it all started off with two hot boys" and they always manage to keep the laughs coming.    It all started up with one hot boy (William Sanderson) and his hot girlfriend (Jessica Alba).   From there, it all went downhill.  A guy (Ernie Hudson) with an "oh" face (Buddy Ebsen) and a "oh shit" face is in the hotel to check out his date (Laura Linney) because he didn't get lucky with her.  After that, a lady (Janine Turner) with a hot ass is trying to impress the boss (David Arquette), and she wants to get the boss to think about moving to New York.  There, she'll get a job, but she'll be back before long.  They have a game of "Hot or Not" and it doesn't take long for them to have sex (without any condom) after that.  In the end, they head out to the park to do some trash talking, and then the boss and the hot gal hit it off.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A couple of good movies. First we have The Godfather and then The Godless. The Godfists seem to me to be the better film of the two, I have no idea why. This is a good film with a great cast, including Steve McQueen and Christopher Walken, and great acting. The film is based on the life of The Godman who is quite an interesting guy who claims that he has been the reincarnation of Jesus. The movie doesn't explain how he can prove this. We don't get to know much about this guy. There is no reason at all to believe that he really did get the same name as a real person.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To think that the movie is actually a "film" is a little hard to swallow (I have seen a lot worse films). It's not just an extremely entertaining movie that takes viewers back to the days of the Great War, it's also very well done historical fiction, with plenty of history thrown in.  It's very short, which allows for easy viewing. The "war" is about as good as it gets, with lots of action, and a few moments where the war is portrayed as if it wasn't. It's actually pretty impressive how "just about everything" is done with little to no expense.   A film that will probably be seen far more than a war documentary:   I wouldn't go as far as to call this a "history documentary", but it certainly does a good job of portraying both the history and the events of the time, as well as giving you a little more of a look into the "how we got to this point" in the war.

I actually don't remember seeing the trailer or even a trailer for this movie, but it looks a bit like a cartoon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie in a 3-D Theater and really liked it. It has a similar story to "The Great Zucchini", "The Little Prince", and "Lady and the Tramp", although I like these films better. I liked it so much I bought two copies of it: the original release for $5.75 on VHS tape, and the re-release for $6.95 on DVD, which I can't justify, because I never liked the movie.  The cast was all very good. Michael Keaton was perfect. His performance wasn't the most exciting, but he had a lot of energy and charisma. He also had an interesting manner of speaking.  It also featured the first great character of the 20th century: The Zucchal.  I wish I could remember which movie this was, since I'm not a huge film buff. It's a bit slow, so it would have been better if the main characters had moved forward a bit.  In conclusion, I like this movie, but it's really a little off to me.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie a lot. It has a nice little "feel" to it that kept me looking forward to see the conclusion. The film doesn't seem to really take a ton from what I think of as the "classic" "James Bond" films and instead leans more towards the more recent "James Blunt" films.   The film isn't quite a James Bond film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story: I was about 9 years old when I saw this movie with my parents. It was the first Disney movie I ever saw (I was a kid, and even in a kid's movie, the plot and dialogue was funny enough to warrant repeated viewings), and it was the movie that launched my love of Disney's (and of course, the entire studio) works into a full blown obsession. This movie also introduced me to the Disney Channel. As if that weren't enough to get me excited, I was also given the first opportunity to see a young, but talented (by all accounts), animator, Mickey Mouse (although, in my opinion, he was a bit like Tim Curry in that he was too smart for his own good), in the very first animated Disney movie. While Mickey was still a child, he discovered an old, abandoned mine and, after digging around for a while, found a piece of gold. He then decided to name the mine Mickey's Gold Mine. After this discovery, Mickey decided he wanted to mine gold for a living, and his first thought was to sell it to the King of the Silver Dollar City. After a short stint in the Silver City, Mickey left (in the end, he lost the Gold Mine to the likes of a "Hamburglar" (a human in a giant hat) who stole it from him) and became a real, legitimate mining prospector. Mickey has always been good at what he does. He loves adventure, likes to do things that no one else in the world would ever think to do, likes doing things that will keep him out of jail, and is always looking for a good time and plenty of gold! Even though I enjoyed it as a kid (and probably enjoyed it even more as an adult), I found it hard to watch this movie (like all Mickey Mouse movies) when it was so "adult", even when the movie was very much focused on his own adventures as a prospector (as opposed to other characters in the movie, such as the King and the princess, which mostly played supporting roles). The acting is, for the most part, good enough (especially the supporting role of Mickey and his friend Goofy). However, it is the soundtrack (written by Roy F. Bakshi and composed by the very talented Carl Stalling), that has stuck with me throughout my life (I've been listening to it for more than 40 years). This is a movie that has a
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was quite bored by this movie, but I didn't have a big problem with it.   It was just ok.  I wouldn't say this is a good horror movie.  It doesn't exactly jump out at you as such, but the film definitely does.  In the beginning we do see a little boy playing in the park by himself.  At a certain point a woman runs across the boy, takes his toy, and runs off.  Later we see the man and woman leave and the little boy continues to play with his toy in the same park.  Then suddenly, out of no where the man comes in with a gun and shoots the little kid dead in cold blood.  A few minutes later the woman shows up with the boy's toy and the man leaves.  We cut to another park, this one much larger, and we see a lot more people playing around.  Now one of the people is playing with the same toy, as is one of our characters.  When the boy is shot dead, another guy comes along and tries to play, but this time the man shoots the toy, kills the guy, and takes away the boy.  There's a guy in a tree near the park who appears to be hiding.  One of the kids that the girl is with asks him to get closer so that he can shoot the little guy.  The guy does exactly that, and the kid dies.  As the movie progresses it becomes apparent that everyone, including the people in the big park, are really evil people.  They are all very mean people, and have nothing in common except for their greed and evilness.  For some reason I really liked this movie and would certainly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My name is Lidia and I am a woman of the old world, and I used to travel from land to land all over Europe in the 1920s.  I would watch the movies all the way in the early morning.  This was before movie theatres were installed in all public buildings.   The theatres that I saw had curtains over the balconies so the movie could not be seen from the balcony.  As an alternative to the curtains the movie was shown in the balcony, but the people sitting on the balcony were not allowed to look at the movie.  The women were covered all the time and not allowed out of the theatres.  The people who were not covered were called "lunch ladies".   When the curtains were down they would go around and bring food to the audience.  We would sit and eat and talk.  It was a different kind of theatre.  I loved it when they were showing " The Wild Bunch " for the first time in Germany. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is one of the few that doesn't try to make a point by having the male lead and his "friend" beat up the other two teenagers. The plot is fairly simple: Two friends, one is a young man who has fallen in love with a pretty young woman and has taken her to a cabin in the woods. Soon after, she becomes a vampire, the only living human. As things continue to escalate, things get a little bit too weird for the two young men to deal with. There isn't really a whole lot of blood to be had, but if you can get past the weird acting and the weirdly paced plot, you will enjoy this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very cool looking movie with a great cast.   From what I understand, the story is about a guy who decides to go on a date with a sexy, hot, sexy lady.  In addition, there are a couple of sex scenes.  This movie doesn't have any "hockey" games or anything.  It is not too violent or anything like that.  The only drawback to this movie is that it doesn't really have any real plot.  There are a lot of twists in the movie that are not even discussed until the last few minutes of the movie.  I'm not sure if you will like this movie or not, but I would suggest that you try to watch it in a darkened, empty movie theater with a clear light. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a line in the movie "The Last Good Man in America": "I'm a big boy and I know how to take care of a big guy."   I was too young to live through the great depression (I was 9 when the stock market crash began), so I can only relate to what is said here. That's what being a child is like.    It's hard to take responsibility when a grown man who is the leader of the most powerful military in the world, is the one who lets us go.  So, I ask my fellow Americans who we are: We are the last good man in America. We're supposed to be a strong people.  We should be able to handle the big boys of the world. But we're weak, and we're in debt to the big guys.  I'm disappointed, to say the least.  If I had seen "The Manchurian Candidate" at age 7, I would have been in awe. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A couple friends take a night off to get drunk and drive to the beach, which is pretty much just a beach that doesn't do anything.   The group ends up having a pretty decent time, until the next morning, when the guy from the car wash comes running out with a box of clothes and asks how they ended up on the beach.  The next morning the guys wake up and find a very large pack of naked men.  With a guy in the back of a semi-truck, driving away.  It's a little difficult to watch this movie, and if you have no idea what it is, you might as well just forget about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   An original, brilliant film that has a truly good storyline. The writing is sharp, and is very effective in conveying a great deal of information. As you read along in the movie, it is like watching a different movie from the one that was made, but that's okay.   In the end, I'm not sure I love this film. I guess there are parts that are very good, but overall, it doesn't impress.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember seeing this movie years ago in high school. We were all huge fans of all the B-movies and the movies that followed. This one was different to most of them in the sense that it didn't just have the B movies but had the movies after. It was a good looking film with a solid script and a good cast. I also liked a lot of the scenes with Mike Nichols.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a story where the protagonist is just about the worst person around. A little child who is always making bad mistakes. His father is an even worse person who would have been better off killed off in the first two parts of the movie because he is such a waste of time. As it's almost 20 years before the events of the second movie we are introduced to an old couple who decide to retire and travel the world. Along the way the son tries to be a good person but never makes it past kindergarten. But what we find out in the end is that the only person who makes any kind of contribution in the whole series is the son. As you can see, the story is completely unbelievable. The fact that it was made in the 80s means it was shot during a period where people lived an extremely simple life. No cars, no radios, no television. The only thing they had was their imagination and a camera and a dream.   The characters were the same for every child in the movies. The son, the father, the daughter. They never grow up but they never stop being stupid and never cease to make mistakes. The story follows the same format each time and is just filled with more stupid mistakes and a bad ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Harmonix's Amplitude is a solid, albeit somewhat derivative, sequel to its hit game Amplitude. The core concept of the game is quite sound - a good group of band-members with a bad situation that needs to be fixed - and the sequel's soundtrack is solid, with an overall feel that feels like it may have been a little overdone. The characters remain the same - they're the same as in the original game, but with a slight (but definitely there) upgrade in their outfits and their overall demeanor. In fact, while the characters in the first game were a little bland, the characters of the sequel are much more detailed, from the way they move to the way their hair glistens in the sunlight. Still, the game still isn't all that different from the original, and while it still has a handful of original concepts that are a lot of fun to try out, it doesn't really add up to much more than a decent, but fairly standard rhythm game. The music, however, is a very welcome upgrade in sound quality that actually fits the game's overall theme better than the first Amplitude. This is something that isn't necessarily something to be proud of, but it does at least make the game more fun, with the music feeling a bit more epic than before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an interesting, entertaining, suspenseful mystery about three very young people who move to a small rural farmhouse to escape from the troubles in their hometown and to start life in the country. Their adventure begins when one of the three children is killed and the police seem reluctant to solve the case. The next day another murder occurs and the local cops are having a difficult time getting a confession and an alibi. The murder seems to be related to the death of a girl years earlier so the case is being taken very seriously by the authorities. But this doesn't mean that everyone is satisfied. The three boys are becoming increasingly suspicious and there seems to have been some kind of involvement between them and one of their childhood friends.   Sara De La Garza in The Girl's Boy The movie, which is based on the novel of the same name by Robert Harris and is directed by Michael Cimino, is not a perfect movie; the story is more or less nonsensical at times and one suspects that someone was trying to milk it for all it was worth. Nonetheless, The Girl In The Girl is a very good mystery and this film is an entertaining mystery no matter what. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm so excited to have seen This is Spinal Tap and I can't wait to watch it again.   This movie has a great theme song, great characters, hilarious performances, and a great script.  So I'm gonna let this movie speak for itself:  If you love comedy and cheap comedy, you won't be disappointed.  A "family friend" tries to get out of the movie business by marrying a woman twice his age.  He is played by Paul Lynde and it's a comedy that is equal parts funny and pathetic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a very entertaining movie with a good cast. The director is one of the best. There is an evil genius that is at work. His plans to take over the planet involve the use of a secret weapon which is really a supercomputer, which it appears is actually a robot. The robots will become the slaves of the supercomputer. The robot is a female that is the only survivor from a failed attempt to stop the robot from destroying the planet. She has the ability to change her appearance into any animal, and this is a major clue that she is not human. She knows that her life depends upon the survival of humanity. There are many other characters. The only problem is that it is hard to follow all of them. But what is the point in following them, if you don't get to see the hero and his friends in action?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie. It has a nice story line, a strong plot, some great performances by some very good actors, and a very nice use of music.   A good story line:  The whole film has this little story, and the movie tells it very well. It is a little something that has a twist and a bit of a happy ending.  A very good film:  There is something here that isn't often seen in movies: a bit about a girl that is not happy in her life and tries to find a place of peace somewhere.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent adaptation of the classic comic strip of the same name by American cartoonist Tom Metzger. This is a great adaptation of a great comic strip by an awesome artist, one of the greatest in the history of comic strips.  The movie is very simple in it's premise: The two major characters are two young students who have been drawn into a comic strip as part of their homework. They go on various adventures with the other characters that make up the comic strip along the way.   The whole thing is a little on the corny side but that is not the point here.  This is one of those examples of how an original comic strip can be taken and run with in a completely different direction. The animation is really good as the camera moves from one panel to the next, capturing the look and style of the comics from a first-person view.    The animation seems a little dated and the graphics can get a little wonky at times, but this is what a good animated comic strip is all about.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is great! The movie centers on a group of young children playing on their own in a woodsy forest in New England. The parents are watching television and there are some strange things happening in the woods, including a strange red-headed girl in a witch hat. At this point, the parents get the children in the house to make them behave. The movie is about a young girl who is trying to find her missing father, but she is also finding the woods frightening.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have not seen an episode of Batman before but the episode is great! They play well with each other, have good action sequences, and make the viewer laugh a couple of times. The only problem I have is there are so many heroes in this show that it is tough to keep them all straight. I would like to see more of this show because it is really fun and I would enjoy watching it all over again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love the original, but I never thought this movie had a chance.   It is a great time.  A wonderful idea, a lovely film, a perfect director.  The film is an original story about a girl whose father has died.  This is the first part of the story.  I don't really like the second part, the way the story was set up was a little bit cliched, but it was good.  It starts off with the man who used to play for the team who was trying to save his family, and it takes a while for us to realize this is really happening.  For me, the best part was the music.  My friend didn't like it at all.

I have had to cut my wife's short hair every single day for 3 years because of her "hair" that's all and you get a good laugh and it has been funny for more than 2 decades! The whole movie is a very good one to watch especially if you have a few minutes to watch it before work or school in the morning and are tired, and want a good chuckle or just watch something funny to end a hard day.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched this movie on several occasions and every time I have enjoyed it. If this is one of those "special movies" that were not so special.   It is a movie for people who are interested in the World of the 20 th Century and its past. I do like films that take us back to our origins and that is the main theme of this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The fact that the film is set in the 1920s is interesting and brings a lot to the character of the main character, played by Peter O'Toole.   Like a lot of good movies, he is a little odd but this is very enjoyable.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie that takes a different approach.   While you may not be able to tell the movie's story from its action, the story is a good one.  And the fact that it also is a love story does make it a little more palatable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The great thing about this film is that while it has a plot line that has been done over and over by many filmmakers and authors, it is still incredibly compelling. From the story we are given that the only reason humans have been able to survive is thanks to a few very special, and not-so-super humans who are able to get along with each other. The humans that populate the planet have created a society that allows them to function on a massive scale. They do so by having a military that has a large arsenal that has helped to keep them safe. Their technology has also made it possible for the humans to travel all over the world. However, this society has the same flaw that we see from the first film - all the humans are very similar looking. There are no differences. This leads to a society with a very small social structure that is ruled by the military, and the few that do have power are the military. The other groups, while having their own leaders, are not given much power. They live in small isolated groups in the countryside. However this does not stop the humans from trying to conquer the rest of the planet. They have built a weapon called a "womb gun," which can shoot and destroy everything in its path.   So to say that this film does a great job of setting the stage is an understatement. We get to see the people and their world in a way that has never been seen. The human's society is divided between the "wombs" (the military) and the "spooks" (civilians). The wombs rule over their surroundings while the spooks live in the outskirts and serve as a check on the wombs. The film starts with a young man named Robert (played by Gary Cole) who has a vision of the future. The womblers are going to wipe out humanity. The men and women of society are all going to be wiped out by a horrible disease called "the black flood." This plague can be seen in our first look at it in the form of a black cloud hovering over a large city. It spreads over the city, killing most of the people in its way. However it has one person that manages to hide from the black cloud. His name is the man we meet in the second section of the film. He is a young boy and the film focuses on him a lot. The black cloud is eventually removed and the city is saved. This leaves the men of society.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think it would be more correct to say that the story isn't very good, because it's not a very good story. I think one of the major problems is that the actors don't seem to have any depth, and the only character who seems to be really developing is the young boy, who, while still a very interesting and complex young boy is clearly not really able to do anything. At the same time, the father is very interesting, a very troubled man, who is trying to do something about his son's behavior, and who seems like he could be a kind of mentor for him, if only the boy was more receptive.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot, while interesting, didn't really excite me that much. I mean I am a film student by day so I would've expected a decent plot to be something I could get into on the first viewing. But unfortunately I came away feeling that this was not a bad movie. It didn't have much going for it but I do have to mention one thing. It's a shame that a film like this had to be made to celebrate 80's fashion because the film would have looked much more contemporary and relevant today.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is all about the people who are involved in the murder of the President, and as I mentioned above there is lots of action, lots of shooting, some excellent chase scenes in the mountains with the motorcycle, and some very well done shots of the mountain and the countryside. A great movie to watch with a young child, who might not be old enough to have seen all of the movies, but it sure is good fun.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an excellent movie in terms of the characters.   First of all, we have our hero John McClane, who is played by an awesome Michael Biehn.  His face looks very menacing and he wears a very badass mask.  This movie is also a great action movie.  The stunts are great, but this movie has all the right gadgets to make it even more awesome.  Also, some of the best special effects are used, especially the airplane crash scene.  There are also some great moments of humor.  Another good thing about this movie is that it has a plot.  It is good that it is a good action movie, but it does make some good points regarding the society.  Even though it deals with a very evil society, it is still possible to get a good laugh out of it.  My rating for this movie:  A   The Good: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great, funny comedy set in the 1960s about a young female tennis prodigy who goes undercover as a baby-faced teenager in order to get a good education. It's pretty amusing, particularly the way her parents make her play games while she learns how to read the paper. Her relationship with her older brother is pretty strong, and she comes close to becoming a pro. This isn't exactly a great film, but it's a lot of fun.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie, while not as bad as I thought it was going to be is still a great film. The movie is about a small town that is struggling to keep a school open after the local school district closes down. There are a lot of kids, mostly from out of town, who come to visit. They are mostly played by great actors who really bring the mood up as the movie progresses. The ending really leaves you with a sour taste in your mouth as well as some great acting from everyone in the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    While I am a bit of a cynic by nature (having read a lot of novels in order to become a writer), I must admit that I do appreciate the fact that Mr. Spielberg's film is about a girl, who travels to the USA to seek refuge from the horrors of war. She's also on a mission to prove that the Germans didn't really conquer the world. All in all, it's an entertaining movie and will keep you engaged until the end.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I always find it fascinating that so many people are attracted to the story of one lonely woman in a small town who becomes the object of the world's interest. And yet, despite the attention and the attention alone, she's perfectly content and always very likable in the movie! It was always a pleasure to watch a story like this unfold.    I highly recommend this film:  It is one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time and a very good movie all around. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be completely honest I found this movie absolutely baffling. The premise of it is that a man gets a job in a small town. He starts having problems with the people that live in that small town and even ends up getting killed by one of the townies. He then decides to do something about it. He becomes a bounty hunter and pursues these people down until he finds a girl who had been missing for a few weeks. He rescues her and then she gives him her last breath. I loved this movie but it was not what I was expecting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Exorcism is a beautiful movie with beautiful performances, even if you can't put the music to the film, the actors are all great, in particular you get to see many of the actors in a movie where they're not all playing small town priest characters, they seem to be doing a better job this time with more confidence and character, I do wish some of the other priest characters were as well written and as fun to watch as the others, they all tend to show off and get too much screen time and as if that were not bad enough, the entire plot, from beginning to end, is just terrible and predictable, I can't help but wonder why the director decided to put such a low budget on this movie, if they can't afford to pay the actors and make the music good then it's obviously not going to be any good.  In closing, one of my favorites, and a movie I would highly recommend to those that enjoy horror movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm giving this an overall rating of 2.5 stars. For all the complaints, it is worth a look. One reviewer said that they found it more enjoyable than the other films he's seen this year. There is a bit of a romance aspect in it, that can't be helped as the heroine is a girl who has no idea about how to dress. She is given some "clothing" from the store that is "out of date". When she goes to the bathroom at a party, she realizes that she's in the wrong body...

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found out about this movie because my daughter liked the theme song. I am not a big musical movie fan, but I have seen all kinds of films, and this movie was pretty good. It is based on a true story: A girl named Sally is in a nursing home and has a broken ankle. She is in pain but is never allowed to leave. Her room is not very nice and the nurse that is there does not like her. She becomes the victim of many nasty things by nurses. In the end, she is murdered by a bad nurse. I like Sally so much, I wish she had lived.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought the movie was pretty good, at least as far as a science fiction movie goes. You could tell that a lot of people had put a lot into this, especially since it was a big budget movie with CGI. This really was a lot to take in at one time. Not only were there aliens but aliens that looked almost as if they were made out of latex. I did really like their costumes, the best part was a creature that looked like a very bad version of a spider. The movie didn't use the best CGI but it sure helped with the alien look. In other words, if you don't mind the aliens in this movie, then you probably will like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie that is sure to be remembered by most of the fans of the original series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the most successful and influential "adult" films in the history of film is "Avengers" (1998).  It is a comic book movie, and unlike most comic book movies, it is far more thoughtful than you might expect.   It contains several moments in which you are tempted to laugh, which, in its way, makes it a much better movie than the comic book version which preceded it.  To put it gently, though, this is a movie about the effects of power on human nature, and how the loss of a good friend can change a man.  It also contains some genuinely funny moments and a few genuinely powerful sequences. It is also a very good action movie, but the "real" action is provided by Robert Downey Jnr.  In fact, most of the best action sequences take place in the second half of the film.  So you may not want to see it too soon after the comic-book version.  A really good actor playing a really good guy? Yes!   I'm not a comic-fiction buff, but I've been reading a number of superhero comics for a number years now and I found this one extremely enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not often that I see a movie that has everything that I want from a comedy: smart and original ideas, great performances, great songs, and a great story. It is always an honor to have such great actors. If you have not seen this movie, then you owe it to yourself to see it. You will not regret it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm sorry to say I had a very bad experience watching this movie.  It wasn't a bad movie per se, but it's simply an awful one.    There are a lot of problems with this movie in one regard:  It has a lot less character development than a lot a other "action" movies.  There's a lot going on in this movie with all kinds of villains/villains and this isn't really a good action movie.  It's mostly a series of fight scenes with pretty minimal character development.  They don't really come alive, they just kinda sit around doing a lot that doesn't really get into the characters.  The only character that does develop is a good dude named Dave, but then after that he doesn't even show up in the movie anymore.  This guy could have been interesting if he was given more time to develop and develop he didn't.  He has a couple of scenes where he can't seem to take off his shirt and the guy has to drag him into a car to drive him to the fight scene (a fight that ends with a cop falling out the window of a helicopter, then the guy takes him to a safe house and then kills him with a grenade).  He had a couple good scenes that didn't last long and one of them is really great.  I do like that he's a guy who can shoot a gun, but I don't know how well he would hold up in a fight against someone who really knows how to use his fists.    The rest of the characters don't have very much to do.  We don't get to see any of the girls and we only get to hear about the bad guys.  All of the action takes place in this small town (I think that's it) and it's hard to see the bigger picture when it's all in front of you.  It also feels really rushed, like it's not even trying to develop the characters anymore. The ending does leave me thinking that I might have been seeing things that are too good to be true.  And even with that ending, there's no real resolution to any of this.  Even if it had been a good end, it's a shame to leave the movie so unfinished. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie, but the pacing is off. We see everything in quick succession from the first day to the last (about 3 hours), so we don't have a chance to feel the full impact of the situation and the characters, or get to know them.  This movie is a movie about an American who can't get into England, because British customs seem to forbid it.  The movie has a good cast of actors (most of whom are famous) and some good songs.  There are a lot of people dying and dying, including the English doctor who is the main character.  It is a bit boring, but a movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved the movie.  For an amateur movie, it is a masterpiece.    A very good movie is made by someone who has a passion and a dedication to the craft.  What is more impressive is that he actually got a lot done in the time he had.  You can imagine, this is a very difficult movie to make.  The film was shot in two days.     The studio was in a terrible state and had never made a film before.  There were several attempts to make the movie, but none of them were successful.  In fact, the movie was rejected by the major studios.  Now, this movie could not have been made by a bunch of amateurs, especially a group of amatuer filmmakers.  It is a true miracle that this movie was made at all.  But the miracle is not just in making this movie, the miracle goes further than that.  This movie is a tribute to the art of filmmaking, and I am amazed at the talent of the director.  He was a student of the craft and got inspired by movies like "Léon: The Professional".   The movie is also a tribute not only to Hollywood, but also to the old school Hollywood that is going down in flames. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the best film by the legendary George Romero and one of his better films in terms of both visual and story line. It is a creepy and bloody movie about vampires, but its very well done and is a very good movie in that it is good at both the technical side and the story and it shows both in great detail. The gore is very well thought out and shot. The vampires are different in appearance, and are really creepy. The movie is set in the 1940's, and is told from the vampire point of view which is a good approach but makes the story feel a little generic, and the vampires are really generic, the way they walk around, they look like they are walking on a skeleton made out of bones. Its not that bad though because it is so good at making the story very well paced and the action is well done. In conclusion, this is definitely a must see for fans of all things macabre!

That is my first bad movie ever!   It is a very bad movie but to make it funny, you must make everything bad.   There are some good jokes here and there and I liked the bad stuff, especially the drug dealer's wife. I do not know his name and the only thing I know about him is his wife's name, which I guess is not his real name? I will admit that some of the bad things that go on in this movie are funny.

The plot, though, is somewhat thin - the film has two separate (though intertwined, at times) narratives that progress at different times: one of a young man who is about to marry a beautiful, rich girl (the daughter of a former German Chancellor of the Nazi era, played by Eva Braun), and the other of a "noble and innocent" boy who works as a valet of the girl's grandfather (also played by Braun), which takes place in the present day, when it is implied that the girl is now grown up (and it's her grandmother's wedding in the background). But the stories do not always keep in step. There is something that is clearly meant to be serious about the girl that does not always go down so well in the audience's mouth (I am thinking of the rather silly scenes with a bunch of pretty German and Italian girls in which the noble- and-innocent boy becomes the object of ridicule). And there are some rather heavy-handed moral judgments, and at one point the old man and the girl (who apparently are about to part) try to take part in a "fun and innocent afternoon" which is really very silly. I could go on, but let me just say this: if you are a man, and especially if you like funny movies, and if you also like old-fashioned German comedy (the kind that used to be played at the theater by the "bauernwandte Blaue") and if the music you like is Frank Zappa, you need to see this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, a good one.  The main character is played by the fabulous, beautiful Kate Bosworth.  I like Bosworth, and it's a good thing I like her, too.  The movie is quite enjoyable, and you'll like the movie, too, if you don't mind it being a little dark.  It's not dark, but it's not as cheerful as one would expect.  Bosworth plays Alice, an Englishwoman who moves to Australia.  Alice's husband, who's a dentist, is very rich, but there are not too many opportunities to spend much time with her.  Her boyfriend, Jack, is handsome but not much of a playboy, and she loves him dearly.  There's a scene where they spend time on a walk and it really brings to mind the classic movie "Sunset Blvd."  But, the whole movie is not quite so light-hearted.  We see the sad end of a little girl (who's a nurse), and then a series of scenes that are really disturbing (and I'll let you judge for yourselves on that one).  I would not recommend the movie to everyone.  If you enjoy movies about very sad situations, or movies that are more violent than other movies, or films that depict extreme behavior on the part of characters, then you may enjoy this one, and if not, not.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It took me a long time to get my first real horror movie. When I was a kid, I used to watch scary movies all the time, and since I was 12, I had seen some pretty bad ones. But then I saw a movie called "The Man who Shaped His Face"   in 1978, and it changed the way I looked at movies. It was the first movie where I felt I had actually been there and it showed me all the old movies I liked and the newer ones I hated.   The movie was very simple: a scientist and his secretary had to keep the human face in perfect condition. It's a great little movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an animated film, featuring a human with superpowers who was discovered in an abandoned warehouse, with only the clothes on his back. He is discovered by a woman, and she becomes his guide to finding the real world. After that, this man is given a second chance at life; this time with a chance of a new life in a different city (in which he can live and work) instead of being in a warehouse in a dark alley. In a funny kind of way, this film is also an allegory. This man is shown to be like a modern-day Prometheus, who could walk out of the dark and into the light.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't care what anyone says, this is a great film. It's a good film.    This film is probably the best sci fi film in a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A big hit! I've seen a lot of things with good acting and I think that's the best thing about this movie. A lot of kids are in trouble in this movie with bad situations. This movie is so funny I can't even think how the director got some kids to play teenagers. I just watched it again and I can only laugh. The first half of this movie has some good acting, funny and fun! I just hope the movie goes on for long time because I really want to see this movie ever again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't had much luck in my love life in general. I know I seem to do the same thing in all the novels, films and TV shows I've loved growing up. It seems that I'm always chasing after "that girl" who's always out of my league. My latest obsession is the love affair between "Sophie" and "Spencer." Sophie has been living in a cave since the age of 14. Spencer has been the only one who knows she lives there. When the cave is discovered, Sophie is so overcome with emotion that she runs into Spencer. That day, Sophie's "relationship" with Spencer begins.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went to see this movie to celebrate a friend's birthday. We went in and a couple people stood up and talked about the movies. We started to watch the movie and we were in a pretty good mood as a family with two children. The kids were actually getting good fun out of the movie. There were a lot of funny moments. I liked the way it was funny when it wasn't really funny. I thought it was pretty funny. It's a good family movie that I would recommend.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed the entire film! The characters and the atmosphere were very original and really interesting. I highly recommend the movie to anyone who loves suspense films.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love how these young, naive characters are able to overcome adversity.  The young hero's first night on the job has the team at work in a panic as he fails at a job that he does not really understand.   This does not deter the boys, however, as they quickly learn the intricacies of a simple job like this and how to get out of a bad situation.  Also, I really like that the young hero is really very young and not very confident.  In short, this is a fun action-packed comedy, which really keeps me entertained. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is about a high school boy (Michael Rooker) who is having problems when his girlfriend breaks up with him. In order to try to get her back, he starts smoking pot, which makes the problems all the more difficult.  It all starts off very bad though with him losing his shirt in some alley, and not only does he lose the shirt, he also loses his pants (he just doesn't seem like he could make it with underwear on).  Then he ends up getting into a fight with some drug dealers and they throw him out of a building.   As he starts stumbling around trying to find his pants, he encounters the police who ask him to leave the building. They offer to help him find his clothes if he gives them a description of the thief.  He gives them the description but says he can't remember anything.  It's a very basic story that doesn't really get very deep or complicated at all and it is the only thing the movie has going for it.  The rest of the movie is just a bunch of scenes of the two boys playing at the arcade and a bunch more bad pot smoking.    It's very much a dumb and uninteresting movie.  Recommendation:  This is a pretty basic movie that doesn´t really have much to it. At least there are some good parts in it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went with my friends to see this movie at the local movie theater.  I have to say this is a good film.  If you like old Hollywood films this is not a bad movie.  The only reason I gave it a 3 instead of a 4 is the character of "Little Johnny" is very one-dimensional and lacks emotion.  He is a spoiled rich kid with a big house and a new car.  But all his wealth comes with a price.  His father runs the circus in town and his mother is very mean and cold.  When I was watching "Little" Johnny I kept thinking about this woman.  They have a big fight over who will get Johnny's new motorcycle.  It is a really cool motorcycle and the ride is not too bad.  This is a real fun movie that is very entertaining and entertaining.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've heard many times that The Shining is the worst movie ever made. I'm glad that this is the case. I mean, there is so much wrong with it, including the fact that the main character is a murderous psychopath! He is so evil that not even the creepy clown in the opening scene is able to stop him. The main character, Jack Torrance, seems very confused as he lives in his childhood home. We follow Jack's story and his quest to escape his father's estate. There are several points where the film feels very much like a short film. We watch Jack and his father arguing, Jack stealing things, Jack sleeping (so obviously this is a dream) and then we see Jack climbing out of the window at the end. This is all very silly. It seems that Kubrick decided to do The Shining as a TV movie because he had a great script and all. There is no substance to the story, but that's okay, because the story is so very silly and yet so very effective. The Shining has never been on my must watch list, but it has kept me looking over my shoulder the past 30 years, and it is quite possibly my favorite horror film. It is a wonderful movie, and I'd be very sad to see it disappear from television. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only good thing about this movie is that it's over soon.   This is really too bad a movie.  I have been trying to convince myself for the last two years that Michael Biehn would be a great actor to bring us some more action in Star Trek  but I was so disappointed.  It is true that Biehn has been very good in the past but I don't want to see more of the same.  You can't help but miss the first time in your life that you get to see an action scene as it's filmed on film.  The battle scenes in this movie were really boring.  There is a lot going on in this film:  - We are in the Enterprise's briefing room and the Enterprise has just arrived in Earth orbit on a routine mission:  to explore another planet!   - The crew of the Enterprise is meeting with their new commanding officer, Commander Spock.  - Commander Spock meets up with the newly hired Captain James Kirk, who is on his first mission as captain of the Starship Enterprise:  He goes off to check out a new planet:  After this, Kirk discovers he can't go back to the ship and it is too late to do anything about it. Kirk's solution is to crash the ship into the planet which will destroy it.  Kirk is shocked that he has to destroy a planet.  However, Spock and Kirk don't see that a crash ship will be unable to return to the Enterprise for some time.  But the Enterprise does return! Kirk calls the old man.  He asks him whether his ship is ready to take off.  His first thought is that the ship has a flaw:  because she is not fitted out with enough power for an interplanetary flight.  "You've done enough work for today" is his only thought.  We can't blame him because this is a really bad movie!  You have all the excitement of an action movie. The crew are busy doing their own stunts.  And then Kirk tries to explain the problem he found with the ship.  In a way, it was a good idea as he would have had a problem.  On the other hand, it is a real shame that the movie had so many problems that it would be better as a low budget movie. What an absolute waste of time this movie was.  All this is worth watching only to see the great fight between Kirk and Spock (as well as Kirk
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story and characters are interesting and fun to watch.  They should be given an Oscar and a Tony award. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie twice.   This film is quite entertaining and entertaining.  The story is very basic.  A young man meets a woman he just has to have.  After they're married, he finds his life falling apart.  His wife leaves him.  She leaves him, because she doesn't find him attractive.  He's too young for a woman, and he's too old for a wife.  Eventually he has to go away to the woods to work.  Well, of course, he takes his wife with him. But this leads to all kinds of problems.  There's the kids.  They're not all that bright.  This doesn't make sense at all.  How do the kids not do well in school?  Does the mother not want to see her children?  There are a lot of problems, so much so that it's hard to imagine what the movie is really about.  As a matter of fact, the movie ends in a whimper.  It's like the whole plot was written and written over and over, and it doesn't get any stronger.  Some scenes are simply awful.  I don't think I could watch this film over again.  But I do remember how good the acting was, how well the movie was shot.  If you want to go to the movies and see a good one, I think I'd go to see this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't want to say it was my favorite movie, but I loved it. It was a really good comedy. I saw it with my cousin who is a big movie buff. He was amazed by the special effects, he also said it wasn't as bad as other sequels. I'm pretty sure it's because it's just a re-run of the movie he saw in the 80s. I also heard that it was really funny. If you like funny movies, I'd go and see this one. There are two sequels. One of the sequels, I heard was pretty funny. It's really a fun movie and I really hope they give the actors the opportunity to continue to work. I really liked this movie.

There was some great action scenes, and even though I thought it was pretty good, I never really thought "This is good," since it never really made me sit and watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen a number of great movies, some really good, others just okay, and for this I give you the very best! I'm not a huge fan of big budget movies, but I thought this one was well made, entertaining and I never thought I'd like a comedy so much! The cast are all great, I don't think they can all get in together and hang out all day, but they are all good fun, like the cast of "Grimm" (which I saw at the same time) but better... and I'm really glad to have stumbled on this!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can see why so many people like this. This is a good old fashioned western where a gang of cowboys go into the Sierra Nevadas to steal cows for the California Gold Rush. The result of their actions is that they end up at a camp of natives led by Chief Joe and an ugly white dude with huge teeth named Billie. There's not much action here, but it's entertaining and has a good time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I have been watching The Thing over and over, I've always wondered what would have happened to all those people inside the Thing's body. Could they have lived to tell about it? I am pretty sure this will answer that question. I don't want to give too much away, but the Thing is played by the great Stan Freberg, and he is one of the best monsters to ever appear in the silver screen. The Thing is a big, beefy, hairy, mean looking creature that is totally ruthless in his approach. The only thing in his world that he doesn't kill is his wife and children. If he didn't kill them, he sure will kill anybody else. The movie takes place in the small town of Miskatonic in Massachusetts and features many of the local actors, and you can tell that they had a great time making this movie. The script is by H.P. Lovecraft and the director was Don Coscarelli, who obviously was a huge fan of H. P. Lovecraft, as he used several of Lovecraft's stories in the film. What really makes The Thing work, however, is how Freberg and Freberg's performances are so perfectly formed, with no wasted words or anything like that. The whole movie is like a good horror movie, and it only gets better from there.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of people say that this is a great movie but a great film and it is. What I mean by a "great movie" is not a movie that is going to make you cry or make you feel anything. This film is just a film, that, in one particular scene has everything you are looking for.   The film starts out with a beautiful scene of a woman walking along the shoreline, with her dog by her side. She is looking out at the water and enjoying her time, when suddenly something happens. A bird flies into the air and lands right in the middle of the woman, the woman falls to the ground and her dog, who was with her, looks at her with a look of worry and anxiety. But she is not discouraged, she decides to get up and see what the bird has done. She looks around, and sees that the bird is flying to the top of a nearby building. She starts to climb the building and once she is up there, the bird flies right out of the building, right into the middle and right back into the woman. It is only then that she realizes that it has been the bird's nest all along. After the woman has seen the bird flying right into her heart, she realizes, that the first time she was saved was when her dog was being chased by a bird. The bird saved her the first chance it got. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To this day I still say, "You have got to be KIDDING me!" A classic movie about a father and his kids in their hometown and the adventures the kids and the father go on. The father (Peter O'Toole) is a very good guy. He loves his family dearly, but there is one small problem. He is really old (in age) and he has grown old very slowly. However, his grandson Danny (Danny DeVito) is very smart and handsome. The film is a comedy and not really a serious look at family matters. It is, however, a very nice movie for a young audience and to remind people how much can happen in a small town.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen both "The Good Guys" and the upcoming "Temptations of Van Gogh" and while the last one (Temptation) was decent at times, it was nothing special.  I would not expect anything less of a movie starring John Malkovich.  If he's not the Michael Jordan of acting, he's close!  There's a bit of camp to him but he has a really good sense of humor and can play a pretty sweet guy if you take the time to watch the movie.  You have to admire his work as a director as well. I'm definitely a fan!  The movie is not bad and it would do well to be shown more often.  It will never get old!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a little bit hard to follow, the first part with the children is good to watch. But after that it is just sad and disgusting. The parents are supposed to love each other, yet they do not get along. The dad is very mean and the mom is trying to hide that from us. The kids are horrible, I do not see one cute thing about them. The little girl is an eye-sore and the little boy is also disgusting. I think these parents need some serious help.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a little hesitant to give a movie with a star from 'The Wizard of Oz' this much recognition, because, as a child, I'd never seen anything that could rival it in my life - and it was a movie that I'd have loved to have seen - but it was pretty darn good - and much more modern.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be honest, the story is a bit weak: a little girl tries to escape her cruel and abusive stepfather with a "good life" in a small town. However, when she tries to leave, she falls through a crack in the ground and lands in a big, dark, evil room. There she's discovered by the giant creature known as Big Bad Wolf. The story gradually goes from bad to worse. We're not told much about the bad guy. It seems that he likes to kill little kids. Big Badwolf likes to eat children, and we soon find out that this is the only reason why his life is so good. At the end of the film, we find out exactly why Big BadWolf is so angry: he doesn't like kids. He wants to kill every single one of them.

But this movie is more than that, there is a lot of acting, and even though there are no guns or violence, there are some good scenes of sex, with an especially nice one with a beautiful brunette in the movie, and also a nice scene of sex in a motel room that really gets me going.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies in the 90s!   In the first 15 minutes the movie starts with a bang!  This is a good example of how good a movie can be when done right.  The way they blend the genres and story lines is genius.   The scene where Jack (Bruce Willis) has to rescue his son, John, from an unknown assailant is excellent.  This scene sets the tone for the movie and the tension is building.  John is so desperate to leave the house that he is a man on a mission!  John tries to steal a truck out of the garage while the two men follow in their truck.  One man gets out of his truck and confronts the father in the house.  It's clear that he has bad intentions, he wants his son dead.  Jack must do what he must to defend his son.  At first Jack seems to be out of control, but after a few minutes he realizes that his son is too scared to live.  A beautiful ending to a wonderful movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm pretty sure this is one of the better movies I've seen this year.   An interesting idea - a world of magic where magic is real and where a woman named C.B. is in charge of maintaining balance and stability in a world that is a very dangerous place.  If you don't know this story already, the film follows the tale of C. B. and her two best friends: a young boy named Oliver (Jacob Tremblay) and a girl named Sarah (Juanita Dominguez).  In the story, Oliver was the one who found C. b. by reading in a book about how she found a way to manipulate the power of lightning - which has turned her into a powerful sorcerer.  C. is a rather cold and emotionless person, but Oliver is not that much different from her.  Also, they are both interested in something C. has discovered in a cave and while exploring that cave, they find a book which is written in old runes. This book then gives them a way into a world, a world without magic - a place where the sun and the stars don't shine or the snow doesn't fall.  However, in this place all is not what it seems.  Some of the creatures seem human, but are not. Others are clearly in the same world as we are and are very dangerous, but they don't have magical powers. Some, however, seem to use magic to their own ends.  It is then up to Oliver and Sarah to find out more about what they are and why they are being attacked.  Unfortunately, all the creatures C. and Oliver face seem to be the creation of C.'s father who is now looking for a good place to build a castle.  Fortunately, C. realizes that what she is dealing with is much more dangerous than she thought.  The film ends with C. returning to her home town with her two companions in tow.  A good movie that you might enjoy if: You are into old timey fairytales and have a fondness for all things fairy tale related. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I'm a huge Star Wars fan, and a big fan of this movie.   The film takes place at the end of the Clone Wars and sees a ragtag group of rebels come together to face off against the Emperor.  The whole film is pretty fantastic with a great cast in it and an epic, almost Shakespearean storyline.  There are a few different scenes that I absolutely loved, and it is easy to see why this film is so popular.  I'm very happy I watched it as it is a very well produced film with a fantastic script and a terrific cast.  Also, I loved the idea that all those rebels were really clones, I've seen that story before somewhere else.  Overall, this is a great Star Wars movie, and I loved it.  Watch this one if you liked the prequels or just want to see some action.  Get your tickets here

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I first came across the film I was not entirely impressed. The story was fairly standard in that it involved the hero, a boy named Jack (Sylvester Stallone) who must rescue his father (Dennis Quaid) from prison after the death of his brother (Danny De Vito) at the hands of the bad guy (George Kennedy). The problem with this movie isn't the story itself but the characters in it. Jack was the goody two shoes that the main hero, Quaid, was looking for. A simple but very effective role for the actor, and the fact that he did it with so much charisma was enough for me to give it a try. After all, the movie wasn't bad. It was a bit slow paced, but I suppose we should expect more from a movie like this. The music, however, was one of the film's strongest features. It is very different from the more famous soundtrack to the film, but it fits the movie. That, along with a solid performance from Stallone in the role of the good guy did enough to give the movie one of my favorites.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first thing I loved about "Frozen" was its catchy song "Let It Go." And the "Let it Go" was good, though not as good as I expected it to be. I know that Disney has always been known to have some of the best music in the world, and I'm not sure "Let You Know" is any different. I'll admit that I didn't really get it, but that probably had more to do with the fact that I wasn't a native speaker of English. In any case, I really enjoyed this one. I found it to have a very happy ending, and the voice acting was pretty good too. It was a little sad, but not to the point that we can't enjoy the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best thing about this movie is the fact that there were never any aliens or anything like that. Just the usual ordinary people living in the suburban neighborhood.  I really like it because it doesn't have any special message to be interpreted in the way that most science fiction movies do. All they do is show that people have all sorts of differences, sometimes bad, sometimes good, and sometimes they just do their best in their own way. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would go out on a limb and say it is one of the great films of the 1970s. I was just a little boy then. It was the first film I saw that really blew me away. I can remember sitting in a theatre watching it, wondering what a big idea this would be, and that is what it was.   The main character is a young boy with a big appetite and a very inquisitive mind. He also has a strong streak of the strange in him that comes from his mother being a little bit crazy, which, to me was an added bonus because in her case it was a good thing because she didn't have any self control at all.  In other words, she would scream at her son and he would scream back, and then scream a second time.  The two of them would then do a little game. A game of jumping over rocks, which is where my big appetite came from.  It was an absolutely thrilling movie.  It also had a very special character played by an elderly woman who seemed to be the only thing keeping the child sane.  A child of 10 is a child indeed.  If you have a big imagination then this film is a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A beautiful, moving, and beautiful-to-watch movie about a poor family that, through no fault of their own, has come to the shores of America. The family is from the island of Guernsey, a small island off the coast of France, located about a hundred miles from the English Channel. This, the islands, are in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and close to the French coast, where they are separated by a small Channel. It is said that there is no one living on the island and it is the only inhabited spot in the Atlantic. But there are also many islands, one of which is called Lofein. It's said that the island Lofen is located far down by the Atlantic, far out in the open sea, in the direction of the Mediterranean. The entire island of Lofeen is known as a beautiful island and is a place for tourists and visitors to spend the day in the sun. The Lofeny is very small and does not have a very large coastline, however, it is a very nice place to visit. The atmosphere is so peaceful and calm, the air is clear and calm. There are many beautiful beaches here. Many are small and quiet, but a small spot by the beach at Lofey is one of those places that you can not pass up. It may be a day out, but at least you can experience this beautiful beach in its most natural and unadulterated form. The day starts with a visit to the beach. The scenery here is very peaceful, as it is so far out and out of the way. But it is still very pleasant here. There is an oasis on the coast, known as Pangorad. It appears as if the oasis is part of a desert in the distance, yet there are no sand dunes or other dunes. If you come here on a sunny day it is possible to get a beautiful view of the beautiful sea. A big part of the movie is spent in the boat as the family explores this place. They look for places to eat and to rest, there are many places to stay. The boat is a large wooden boat and the adults take turns to take turns going on land and then back to the boat. The children run and jump all over the boat, running, jumping, and climbing all over it. It might not seem like much, but this was a lot of fun for everyone! At the end of
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have never seen this movie before, but I do remember some interesting bits from the book. This movie is a bit strange in that the girl (I think she is called Jessica) is a little too clever and a little bit too innocent, so I'm not sure if the director and the scriptwriters tried too hard to capture that innocence, but it's not bad at all and definitely worth a watch. The performances are good and the animation is good, but sometimes the music gets in the way and takes up a lot of time. Overall this is a good little romantic comedy that has some pretty good laughs.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this comedy, there are two brothers who are best friends - "The two most dangerous men I ever knew," says the one. "When I told him," says another, "that I was taking over the family business, he said, 'Well I guess I'll have to do. Who cares about a guy like you, anyway?' " The brothers are a little shy and awkward, but with enough good humor to make the comedy a very enjoyable one - and it would be even more enjoyable with a more serious or dramatic story than this one. I was glad to be able to watch this when it first came out.

My daughter and I really enjoyed this movie.   What I don't understand is: Why did they choose to cut all the dialogue?   The dialogues are a bit too slow and I think we should have seen more of this wonderful movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I first heard about this movie a couple years ago on the BBC radio program that is produced by the BBC in London, England, which is a really good program.  It's interesting to hear that the movie was made in England because it does look like London in this movie.  This movie has a very interesting story:  The movie's story is really interesting because of how all the story lines start to intertwine at the end.   The story is also very well-balanced and realistic because of the fact that it's based on real life events.  I really enjoyed this movie because of its amazing plot and interesting story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A decent movie but don't get into the whole "black and white" thing; it isn't black and white it is a combination of both. The movie is an interesting mixture of old and new with very few clunkers here and there and there is a pretty good soundtrack with songs by The Ramones, Peter Frampton and a few others.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When i heard the idea of a young man (David Fincher) who was sent to prison, in search of the killers of a police chief, i instantly fell in love with the film. The film does well in its plot (in the beginning it becomes too complicated) and does it with an awesome style. David Finckerer is good enough to be an important character in the film, but there is still enough left to be desired.   In the end, Finchener is left as a strong, and yet weak character. His father (Fincher's grandfather) is the most important character, but Finchesher's father, who is an ordinary man, is just as important in the story. The ending of the movie is not perfect and not without its flaws, but it is very strong. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie looks, sounds and feels like the "old" films of the early '60s: a good old film- no frills but a good, good film,  In other words, good old, no frill Hollywood. The film is "just" about the first man to walk on the moon. It was also the first film in which the moon was shown to have a crust, and that fact gave rise to much speculation among the scientists and the movie's "stars." The fact also prompted a man named Ed White (Paul Newman) to say, "I guess we'll live to be old, old men on the Moon." A few months later, Ed White and his family go to see the movie again. They go in expecting to see another man walk on The Moon. A man named Neil Armstrong, who had become a national hero, lands in the middle of a lunar field. In space, Neil, in one of the most exciting scenes in movie history, takes a picture of the Earth and Moon. Then he goes back to Earth, turns the camera around, looks back, takes another picture, and finally puts it into his camera to bring it home for his wife, a girl named Annie, who is with him. Annie, too, is excited: "Neil looks really happy on the way home! This reminds me of me, when I went to bed for school one night, and I could hear Neil in the back of my head saying, 'You see how beautiful the Earth is! I have never seen Earth like this!' And it always seemed to be changing. You just felt it going 'round.' "    The movie was produced by Stanley Kramer, who, during his life, produced some pretty good movies. He also produced the "Dirty Harry" series, the "The Last Samurai" series and the "Ace in the Hole," (the only movie in which a chimpanzee is used as a punching bag). The original plan for this movie was to cast some of the actors from the earlier movies, but they turned it down because they had other projects lined up. The "moon" idea was suggested by an editor of "Star Trek," and, in the first draft of the script, this idea was given some depth by a line of dialogue about having seen the moon before (as opposed to having seen it in some distant galaxy). There was one scene involving a man and a dog that had to be cut from the film because
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you have a great movie like this one, you have to think about your reputation. And who is more important to your reputation than the hero of the story, Robert Louis Stevenson? He was a true British gentleman and gentleman with a great many talents, but the true genius of his work is his writing. In this classic story, he created the most beautiful story to be found in the world, a tale that is both tragic and beautiful at the same time. And no wonder he was such a well-known author. I have only a slight criticism of this movie. When Stevenson writes, I feel that I must write. The characters in this story are great and so are the situations they find themselves in. However, they do fall a little short. The dialogue is a little long and clunky and it is not the most attractive movie to look at. However it does a wonderful job of showing how one can live a life of great beauty with the help of a great big hat and a huge pipe. In a strange sort of way, it was a good example of a life well lived. I would highly recommend Stevenson's books to anyone who loves adventure and is a fan of good literature. - April 2, 2008The perfect book
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot?   It was good, but not really original.   There was a whole lot of talk, but it was pretty much what we expected it to be.

However, the device fails when the device is made out of a human heart in a jar in the shape of a star. The device is then brought to Earth and the doctors have to use a time machine to save everybody. The best part is the time machine is controlled by a little girl, she calls the device "Baby" and is so cute it is funny to watch her play with it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The idea of it seems like a good idea, but the execution on the whole is bad. I like the character work, the script is decent, but they don't have a lot of opportunities to do it. I feel like the whole film is trying to make people laugh, and it doesn't. There are moments where the film seems like it was going to work, but then the laughs just don't land. I can't say that I am a big John Waters fan, but I thought he made one good film about a bad person and one good one about a nice guy (which is his biggest weakness). I would love to see a John Waters 2, because he makes films with a few good ideas that have a few flaws in them, but he still makes them interesting and funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film will take you on a journey from a small, sleepy town (I think it's a small town) to a big town and beyond. This is the kind of film that is truly unique, there are so many wonderful moments that we will never forget.  One of my first movie memories is being at the local theatre with my dad when this was playing at a small theatre near our home. My parents watched this in the theatre (I had my little brother with me) and we sat next to each other watching it over and over until it was my turn to sit down. I still have the ticket from that night on. My memory of that evening is vivid, we didn't just have an enjoyable movie, we had an interesting conversation with each other about our lives and our family and we just talked to each one of them on the same level as how we would talk with each of our friends. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is like a good book that you read over and over and try to figure out what's happening.       It was about a woman who goes out to get a good night's sleep only to find her boyfriend murdered by a guy who came to the motel to talk to him.   If you like books that are about things that go bump in the night you will like this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The "Frost/Pierce" series have been a staple of Canadian TV for many years.   It's a good mix of comedy, action and romance.  The movie is a remake of the original TV series.   A fun romp all around...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I never saw a movie quite like this one - a simple, yet beautiful story about a beautiful girl who comes across a beautiful rock and falls in love with it. And how it never ceases to amaze me that it can be told in the film "Ivan's Theme", a movie in which, after the opening of the main part, we have some simple pictures that, on one hand, convey the feelings we have after seeing this movie and, on the other hand, remind us of Ivan's "Bravo" - I have just watched it again and it has reminded me in a very pleasant way what I thought of that wonderful movie! But what makes this a truly great movie is that you never sense any of the stereotypes that seem to be present in films that deal with the beautiful-and-hanging type of women. I know we tend to make light of them - and I am a man not exactly known for doing so (and, to be sure, there are some great female artists who belong to the great male writers in this world, among them the great Molière; it's just that the women in these kinds of films often end up as objects of male desire, just as Ivan does in this movie) but I never thought of these pictures as being less important than the artistry of Ivan. I think it was his "Babette's Feast" that gave me the idea of this movie as being something more than just a collection of pictures - he created one of the most beautiful and sad films ever made (and I think he did so even though, according to the critics, his style was something that, in his time, was considered "immoral" because of its strong sexual element and its almost pornographic themes). I have never seen this movie made better and I have seen it made worse. There is nothing "bland" about it - everything is so moving (and the story about the falling rock is perhaps the best scene in the entire film), from the beautiful images to the sad, beautiful, touching scene about the dying young man when, with his last breath, he tells his daughter that he loved her. As you may see, Ivan's Theme is as much about the beauty of the girl as it is about the sad ending of the young man's life. It is a powerful, heart-rending film, and in its way, it has something to say about the world - about love, death and beauty - about life - about

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Last Boy on Earth" is a very good movie (for a movie), an action-packed sci-fi movie (in that it stars a dog - who is an android, which is a really cool invention- with no speaking part; the other characters do talk, which just makes the movie more entertaining. The story (as told by the robots' creators) is about a man who is given the choice of life in a space colony or death in space...and his robot friends try to help him choose and to convince him to do so. It is a simple and silly movie, but it has a lot of interesting details. It does not bother to use dialogue to communicate the idea to the audience; instead, it makes the viewers feel like they are the characters and they are in a movie. They are on a spaceship, talking to a dog and the dog talks back. It has something about science fiction and about the nature of life on a planet in outer space. It also does not worry about science, but is very realistic in its depiction of life.    It is very funny.  I loved the dialogue and jokes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a fan of the James Bond films. I loved the first two, but I've always thought the third was a bit under developed, but not enough to stop me from watching it.  I think the second film in the series was better, but this one is a classic Bond movie with amazing set pieces and some great Bond girl moments.  The acting is top notch and I'm sure they really wanted to give the film the respect it deserved.  A very enjoyable Bond film.    Watch this movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After a long time I think it's high time to give an overall view of the whole story: An extraordinary story involving a small German town and a Nazi concentration camp. It is remarkable in many respects: the concentration camp and the Nazi propaganda of the time; the cruelty of the guards; the courage and endurance of the prisoners; the determination of the soldiers; and the personal stories of all, the prisoners and the non-commissioned officers, who are all brave, heroic people. They are all of noble character. The action is very simple yet intense, there are good pictures and excellent performances. One feels very close to the characters - there are many who, without exception, are real men, with their own way of living and in addition to that their moral sense is impeccable: The camp itself is well photographed. It was directed by Fritz Lang. I don't know whether it is worth seeing, and what it adds to the history of World War II. But I do hope you will see it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The premise of the movie is a perfect one: one night as the family is on vacation in a deserted island (of sorts), the kids decide to go to the park and look for a good game. While in the park, they come across a group of zombies who have just finished eating the locals. They manage to kill the zombies, and get back to their hotel. The next morning the kids find some of the corpses in their room. The adults don't show up, and the zombies seem to be having a picnic. Now, I've seen plenty of zombie movies before (like, I don't know, Shaun of the Dead and World War Z) and I can say that this isn't bad. It's a well written movie, with a few scares thrown in. However, this particular scene is what really stuck with me.   If this is true, the movie does a great job of bringing a zombie movie to the screen. This is a great little horror movie, and a few jump scares (of the "scary" kind, which I love) and decent gore make this for a great watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first half of The Last Picture Show is a beautiful meditation on the nature of reality. It's beautiful in its simplicity. The two men from the future who fall in love with the people from the past have a long talk in the present. After the love story is over, the two men watch a movie about the past and remember how the people in the past used to do things. At the end of the movie, the people of the past are watching the two actors in the movie in the last scene. The actors are dressed as the people who were in love in the future. They are talking about how they fell in love and they are looking at the two people in front of them.    I watched this movie in my parents' home in the late 1970s. I remember the movie being a beautiful one, with a beautiful mood. I think the idea came from The Graduate. The plot is simple, but the movie has a surprising amount of twists. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think my most recent movie, The Dark Knight Rises, is a movie that, in many ways, was never really intended to be a "special" movie. We know Batman is not a super-hero, but this movie was a sort of "special," in the sense that, for a while, most of the movies that were meant to be the Batman-buster were pretty much trash. This one, though, actually took a few twists and turns that we've not seen before, but it was still very well-made.   This film has all the action, drama, romance and humor that has become our go-to Batman movie. A few of the jokes come very late in the movie, but most of them are there the whole time and really enhance the film for me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie which is a bit hard on the eyes especially the last few minutes when the camera gets close to the woman who was holding the baby. She is a pretty woman, with a kind, sympathetic smile. She takes care of her daughter and is always kind to her neighbor, but she is not a saint. I am not sure this movie is a good idea since it's so easy to find some kind of moral to these stories which is not usually easy to discern. The characters can be all over the place. This is a hard film to explain to a friend or family and I think it is better to let it be.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is about two young brothers and their father, a Russian general who was responsible for the assassination of John F. Kennedy.  At age 9, his older brother, now an adult, is assigned by the general to train American troops to be more effective at killing people.  And he does a pretty good job.    His brother is a total asshole who acts like a total ass and has no real redeeming qualities.  There's also his brother's wife, a red-haired whore who, at least for the most part, tries to act like a proper woman.  She does some shit with her hair which is kind of cool in a way but I don't understand why.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I first heard about this movie at my old friends house and I must say I was not disappointed. This movie takes place in a world where humans can transform into animals. A young boy and his dog travel to the city of Voorhisville to seek a new job. The dog is very excited to see the town, but unfortunately the boy becomes disinterested and doesn't take the time to meet anyone. When the boy fails to get a job the owner takes the opportunity to try and recruit the boy. The boy can't even wait until he arrives at his new job in VoorHisville and he begins to find out that it is no easy place to live. His boss does nothing but annoy him and the place does not provide much money. With this news the boy moves to New Orleans to make some extra money. There, he does find work but has to work hard to get the job. He must stay late at work to show that he is there. He does work hard, though, and finds out how to use his powers and how to get to the other side. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is my third movie I've ever seen by Frank Zappa. The second one (this one) is a little different from the previous one, but I think if we're being honest about it, we can at least agree that this is one of his more personal, personal, very personal films. We'll have to see what happens after this, because it sounds like this movie is the last of the Zappa films we'll get for a little while. I can't find any good reviews about it online, but my own impression of it was a little disappointed, but not really. There were a few moments where I thought Zappa was really on a roll, but at other times he seemed to come up a little short, but the overall impression I got was that he was in a very good mood most of the time. It could be a little bit too long for my tastes, although I'd like to see a little more of it. This is probably my favorite movie of the three he's made so far, so perhaps it's good that he's moving away from movies that are more about the music or the band to something much more personal. As much as I enjoyed this movie, it is more or less a very brief experience, in my opinion. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a fun little romp that will entertain most ages.

This is a great, action packed movie about two outlaws, who have a run in with a band of gun wielding cowboys.  They're not the smartest of men, but they know what they're doing.

It's definitely worth checking out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is a strange mixture of love-at-first-sight, jealousy, desperation, love at last... and a few pretty good old-fashioned kinky sex acts. It's like a movie that's been waiting to be made for many years.      This movie may be of a similar nature to the one which came before it, but it manages to be somewhat more "modernized" than its predecessors. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's been a lot of great movies made about the early days of the United States. This is one of those great movies. We are introduced to the life and times of Daniel Webster at the moment of his birth. We hear his mother's story and learn that he was fathered by the President of the Bank of the Orient. It was his favorite movie and his favorite play. This movie is a beautiful piece of cinematic art. It is also a great tribute to Daniel Webster. I can't say enough good things about this movie, it is wonderful and a very fine piece of work. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of the movie is a fairly faithful adaptation of the novel, with some obvious changes made to the plot (such as the ending), but still it's a very good adaptation. The screenplay is by George R. R. Martin, although his involvement seems very dubious. The movie is set in what I call the Northern Waste, and it has a rather Northern setting for the Waste, which would mean a much colder climate, which is something that I haven't really liked about Game of Thrones.   It's interesting that in the book the title is changed to the Waste Not - but they didn't even change the title in the TV show. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a classic. I think that most people, myself included, are still under the impression that a great love story doesn't have to be romantic, and that the only way to be dramatic is to have an unbelievable climax. Of course, if you look at the great American films of the last half of the 20th century (and there have been many in the past 100 years) you will see that no great love movie is ever without a "love" story. Of the many love stories you'll see in the films of Stanley Kubrick (who did not direct Dr. Strangelove, but is known for his great love stories), there are many in which the lovers' love story is less dramatic, more comedic, and less exciting than the romantic movie the film is actually about. It's not that Dr. STRANGELOVE is not romantic. It is, just not with the drama I have seen in most other great love movies. It doesn't feel romantic in the way that I have watched and loved so many romantic movies in the last 50 years. There is some really great work on screen by Laurence Olivier as the Doctor, and his brilliant performance is one of the reasons the film works. Olivier was a great actor throughout his career, and even though he didn't win many awards, he made a very good living with his acting. For me, though, the best performance is that of Anthony Hopkins, who really gives Dr. T. a bit of a comic turn. I haven't seen many of the other great performances in Dr. Strange, but Hopkins's portrayal is a memorable one. The most wonderful scenes in the film come during the time Dr. Strong is having sex with Dr. Thompson (played by Susan Sarandon, who was a really great actress in other films. But when Dr. Hardy was in love with Dr, she was always very pretty. She is so pretty, in fact, that the viewer can't help but be reminded of Susan Sarando's beautiful character in ER. And she gets much more screen time than Dr. Tristan Strong. It was wonderful to see her back in the limelight. Even though Dr. Jones was very funny in the movie, I liked the scene where Dr. James Jones talks to Dr. Thorda and they both say the same thing (and then they switch to English). It was just a nice throwback to the times before "black" characters were so well treated in film. The other acting

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you want to watch a good action movie this isn't it. A good action film is a film where all the action is done by the very same character, with the same mannerisms. It is a perfect film if you only want to see a man kick an elephant over a cliff and it doesn't really make the film any better.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first part was pretty good, as usual, just nothing that is really memorable. It did feel like the first two films were done by the same director, since both are about a guy who gets to see a beautiful woman for the first time and, after a brief, awkward meeting, falls in love with her, who he sees a lot of. It didn't feel like a film that was trying to be more than a romantic comedy, but rather just a simple comedy. It has a couple of funny moments, and a decent story (which has been done a lot in this decade, by "the" director, but nothing really special), but nothing that I would watch again. But hey, I'm looking for a good romantic comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie, I give it an 8/10. The movie itself is about a man who is an expert in martial arts and then, in a very sad turn of events, decides to join a gang of criminals known as the Tijuana Locos. His father is a Mexican army general and he joins up with them so he can kill the Mexican cartel and then go home, I guess.  This movie was a lot like The Mask, except that instead of being in a cave in a Mexican desert, it was in a New York city, although at the time New York was still the same, boring, corrupt city we all know and love. I'd say The Mask is a better movie because it's better, and The Tijuana Gang is a worse movie, it's about the Mexican mafia and it is very, very, not very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a novel in the history of cinematic history.  The film was written in 1926 by Arthur Schnitzler.    ( I'm sure this guy had some big ideas about his film)   The story centers around a couple who is engaged to be married.  They live a comfortable, if somewhat mundane life.  (This is the sort of film that would make everyone want to live normal lives.)   Eventually, the guy is called to do a business transaction and the wife has to go into labor.  When she's ready, she gives birth to a daughter.   The mother, feeling rather proud of herself, gives up her place at the salon for a life of ease in a comfortable home where she has a big bed and comfortable table for her little girl.     Things go awry when the wife begins to worry that her husband is not home and when she goes to look for him, she finds he's been killed and left for dead.    The wife realizes that someone killed him and that the person is her husband.  It turns out that the man has a mysterious background that is unknown to the wife.  He was once a wealthy man who had been living a luxurious life with all his worldly possessions when he was suddenly attacked by a violent criminal, was stabbed repeatedly, suffered a number of other injuries and succumbed to his wounds.  His final words were, "I'm sorry, but no one has the right to kill a man like me."   It is here that our film begins.  The husband is found hanging from a tree and the woman is taken away in a state of shock.   There's a detective on the case and he is quickly out of the case when the murderer shows up with a group of other masked people.   It is then discovered that the murderer is the daughter and the new wife's father.   (Well, I hope you've seen "Night of the Living Dead."   They get into a bit of a scuffle and the husband shoots the father through the mouth and the daughter, now armed with a deadly weapon, shoots the husband twice.  She manages to take the man's gun and hold him, until she's attacked by the husband's other guards and flees. )    The killer is found and arrested but the new husband is unhinged in his anger.  While in the police station, he shoots the detectives in front of

The actors and writers had fun creating characters that are not likeable and not unlikeable.  It is a movie about family and what it means to love them and be loved by them.    -
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't mean to pick on  A Beautiful Mind  auteur and Nobel Prize winner  Richard  Branson, nor the movie's lead actors,  George Clooney and  Ben Affleck, who do a good job with their two lead characters.  I do mean to critique the  A  Beautiful Mind's saturated color palette, as well as the overuse of lighting that's very bright and too much.   At about half-time, the movie stops playing to tell us that it's time to go into a different part of the park.  A Beautiful  Mind  is a movie about "human progress," but this particular advancement is being accomplished with one foot in front of the other.  So, a woman named Mrs. Sylvia Brown (a.k.a. "Mother") takes a job in a local factory and begins a long career in the factory.  It's a nice, if brief, start, but we soon realize that Mother has lost her memory and is now working for the evil factory owner, Dr. William Wise.  Mrs. Brown is the last person that A Beautiful Mind   wants to run into.  We learn a little about her, her life, and the fate of her son, but it doesn't really do much to make her more sympathetic.  The movie is a pretty good movie.  There are some nice performances by the leads, Bennet O'Donnell and Ewan McGregor, and a great musical score by  Alan Menken.  However, there are flaws with the film:  A poor acting performance by Evan Peters, who plays Mother, is the biggest problem, but I'd say that the problem starts with the story of the film.  Even though the film is about the idea of progress, it is not very good at conveying the idea.  At first, I found it hard to imagine a movie where A  Beautiful Mind   could be taken seriously.  But after seeing a few reviews of this movie, I've come to think that maybe this is actually a movie that can be done right.  To be fair, it's not even a bad movie.   It's pretty good.  As I said, a good idea and good casting.  This movie is like watching two different movies playing out at the same time.  What's weird is that this movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not know a lot about the first Alien, but after seeing the theatrical release I was immediately hooked. I loved that little creature from deep inside the ship looking down at us. In fact, he had me transfixed with his stare all the way through. It was an all around great film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie about the old Soviet state was made in 1987. The film is a great piece of propaganda. The story about the great Soviet dictator Stalin is really fascinating. It is a really important movie for many people. One can see the reasons why the Soviet state grew so great. There are some serious problems and people had to struggle really hard to do something. There is a big difference between the "good" Stalin and the "bad" Stalin. The "good"-stalin can do everything for you. He is very good at politics. It can't be said that he is a total bad. The bad one was more cruel. He does not really care about other people. The real Stalin was really great because he could put all his effort into one thing, one goal: The destruction of the "oppressor". Stalin was an extraordinary individual. I am sure that most people know how Stalin was, but to some people Stalin can't seem to exist anymore. The movie is about the history of a very interesting era. A bit about Soviet history is told, but that's it. A very simple, interesting and sad film. One of the best movies made after 1989. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a wonderful sense of scale and a well-oiled machine in this movie. When the monsters begin to attack a beautiful suburban house, there is a scene where a mother-in-law and her two small children flee to the closet. They try to scare the monsters away. When I first saw this movie I had a nightmare about the monsters.   It was pretty intense for a family film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went into The Big Lebowski for a single viewing, knowing nothing about it, but was struck by how many things I recognized from my childhood. I remembered how much I loved that movie, how funny it was, how touching it was and how fun it was. It really is a classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There were some good moments, but I really can't see any reason that the plot is worthy of the name. The whole movie is pretty bad. All the actors are really terrible. I found their accents pretty annoying.  This story does have a few good parts in it though.  I just wish they would have made the plot a lot better. I don't believe there was any plot in this movie!  I found it pretty bad!  This was a pretty terrible movie. I've seen better movies from this year than this one.  There are a couple good parts though.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You will never know the movie is in black and white unless you watch it in black & white.  The picture of the two people at the end are very pretty.   The music is good enough to get you into the movie without the picture.  The "I" and "me" is so cute!   I wish more people were like this little lady. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was born into the movie business, and I will never leave it behind me. I am not a fanboy of movies with stars, they are too often pretty lame and the cast is one of the best ever! In addition, they all have one thing in common: great acting. The movie is about a couple, one of whom is a lawyer and the other a high-powered attorney, who fall in love. They meet and spend some time together but the film quickly turns into a very odd love story involving a bunch of strange characters. It is hard to explain the plot but it is probably best I tell it in a movie trailer:  The wife goes to her husband for help with a problem and the husband tries to help her but ends up falling for the wife and then having sex with the wife.   In a very bizarre movie, I would like to see the wife return home and have her husband get a divorce so she can marry a man she has fallen in love with and then he would have sex with her. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie made me laugh out loud from start to finish.   It is a comedy about a man and a woman who take a house in a city to live in and they do.  It's also got a couple of love stories that make me smile.  If you are a sucker for a good romance I recommend this for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great film and a great love story. I think I will watch the entire 3-part film on its own.  There was no other film about the love between this woman and the man for whom she was willing to put up with all the abuse.  This really was the story about love and loss and courage and how love takes the hardest beating of all and yet keeps on ticking...a very powerful movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is, if anything, one of the best of modern film era. It's an old school film, with a cast that still works today, and even if you like some of the more cheesy stuff it's one of those films that you can see the charm in, despite the cheesy parts.  The director is not a great one, but he knows how to make fun of himself.  If it was a different time, the movie would have been a big hit!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Cinematography: 10/10   Director: 10 - 10 (for the movie anyway!)   Sound: 9/10, not great but not bad either. Not bad in general but it was definitely a mediocre movie.   Art: 6/10 and still mediocre. The artwork is great for a 3 min movie, but the 3 min is too short. It ends so abruptly that it is like the end of the movie. The ending is a little anticlimactic. If it had stayed on for another minute it could have been good but it never did. I was hoping for something more than a mediocre 3 minute movie. I would have given it a 10 but at the time of this review it is only a 9/9/9 so a 10/9.   the animation is great. It was really refreshing to see a movie that wasn't just a 2 minute 2 second slice of life. It actually had a story. It had characters. It wasn't a slapstick comedy. It also wasn't an action movie. It has moments of humor. It isn't perfect. It is not as good as a movie should be. It didn't do much for me. The story is really boring. Even though the movie itself was only an hour long it had such a short runtime that I only saw it for 2 minutes. The art was okay. I could tell that there was potential here. It could have gone so much further. It would have been really interesting to see more of the story from the point of view of the aliens. Even if I didn't get anything out of it I would still say it was a great short movie with a good story. Even the sound of it was really good. It sounded like a movie. There were some weird sounds in it as well, such as a little girl crying, the sound effect was really eerie. It definitely wasn't bad. But it is still not as great as a lot of movies like it. This was just a nice 2 minute movie with really great art. I am not sure if I would say it is a 10. Maybe a 9. But not a 10 if this was the length of a movie such as Tron or Toy Story. A 5 for sure because it isn't as good. I really didn't enjoy it as much as I would like to. It did leave me a little puzzled though. I don't know why, maybe the fact that it was such a cheap
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a scene right at the end where the movie's hero says that he's going to take a rest after his long and very exciting battle with the baddies. I thought that that's kind of a cool bit of foreshadowing that's never followed up on. What the hell is up with the movie these days?

If you are a fan of the 80's you will probably like it and if you are not you probably won't. It is good and funny with some pretty good acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film begins as two young women are driving around and find a pretty girl playing in a nearby pond. They find her and she has a pet frog. The two women take her frog to a nearby stream and it gets into a pool. The girls swim up to the surface but the girl who is sitting on a rock is suddenly sucked into the water.   I think it would be a more interesting film if the girl was the only girl and the girls did not have any other females. They all get sucked into a giant pool that is about the size of a small bathtub.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the most exciting and imaginative movie I've seen in a long while. From the beginning of the film we are introduced to an eccentric, rich, eccentric, but lovable guy who is so fun to watch you feel guilty about spending so much time with him. His antics with various other oddities throughout the city are so fun and entertaining that you just want to laugh and giggle and be merry. A great time is had by all. It is a must see for all children in the world.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I did a research on this movie a while ago and I think it's an amazing movie and I feel sad that it ended like that. I was really intrigued by the fact that he was able to make such an entertaining sci-fi movie, and I've watched a few other movies like these ones to see if they were any good. The Sci-Fi genre is so diverse that there's no way it can all be good, and we don't even get to see much of a good one in this movie. I'm really glad that the director decided to make this movie, I wish it had turned out like the other movies he has made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's really strange how a movie about a serial killer can get released with a $5 budget. It's a great film, and at times I felt like I was watching a TV movie. It has such a slow pace that I felt almost like I needed to be medicated. I would say that if you're looking for a thriller, this is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is set in a fantasy-like realm called Alagaësia (pronounced AL-gahs-see-ia, which sounds rather odd, except that this is an older French movie, originally created in the late 16th Century). The most interesting and well known feature of this film is certainly the appearance of the beautiful Alina Baartman (I am thinking of her portrayal in the movie "Les Liaisons dangereuses" ), in a costume that is almost indistinguishable from that of a medieval ballerina. In this film, Baartmans' character is a princess who is in love with the king (played by Maurice Chevalier), the son of a nobleman who is a good ruler. He comes to be known as King Guillaume (which doesn't really make any sense in French) and is considered a great military man. His father wants his son to marry a princess (played beautifully by the wonderful Eva Morisot). They both make love to each other, but it does not last long because the prince becomes a tyrant and destroys Alagaie, the kingdom, and himself. He is executed. As a result, the princess, with the help of the wizard who knows the secret of King Guillameux, escapes. She comes to the aid of the peasant, Guillaumet, who is one of the many who have been expelled from Alagaire and is now a fugitive. During their journey they come to the kingdom of the mysterious sorceress, The Fairies, who show them the way to their home. They arrive at the palace where King Guilemeau (Maurice Chevaliers' father) has a magic mirror in his castle that reflects Baartmaans' face. It also gives her the ability to disguise herself as a prince. But it does nothing to protect her from the harshness of her kingdom. In her first battle she is attacked by a lion, which is a real beast, that does not belong in this world. The fairy queen, the fairies' mother, makes a wish that GuillaUME will one day marry her, but Guillaumoue is not pleased by this idea. They are later married (the fairies are also the daughters of King Miquel and Queen Clorinda; I don't remember the names of the actors, but you will find out later) and go to live in another world which looks similar to this one (they

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good story, a simple one, with a twist that will make anyone smile and then a twist, not in a bad way.  This movie has all the right ingredients to be a great film.  The director of this film, Robert Altman, was a real talent who wrote some of the finest comedies in cinema, like "The Player" and the unforgettable "Scent of a Woman," and he took on the challenge of writing a comedy about an abusive, alcoholic father.  Altman did a wonderful job, creating an environment that is just like the house that you grew up in.   This film really had the potential to be great, but it just never worked, and is sadly lost to history. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw this movie I was expecting to laugh my ass off at the ridiculousness of a man trying to play both parts of a high school prom star.   The movie, however, showed that the director didn't know how to make a bad movie: it was just a bunch of people getting into silly antics.  I also liked the acting, especially from the four lead characters, and I thought they did an outstanding job at setting up the ridiculous situation.  It had a few great parts, especially when they were discussing how to get the attention of a girl, and the movie also had a couple of hilarious bits involving a kid dressed as the Beatles.  Although it did a lot of goofy things, and was just as silly as it sounds, it wasn't that bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised by this movie.   It is well made and a lot of fun, which is good, because there are many comedies from recent years about the same kind of thing that aren't.  In fact, it is very different from many of these, not a bit!   This film stars two very young (in fact almost child-like) kids, Peter (a boy) and George (a girl), who are traveling around the world on a motorboat with their uncle (an elderly fellow).   The uncle is a "dentist" with a funny accent who makes fun of them, but he gets into trouble when he runs afoul of the local Indian.  They go through a number of adventures as they encounter a series of bad men, bad luck, an evil dog, and more bad men.  It also features a pretty darn funny musical number which is included here as an afterthought.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie that has everything.  It's set in the middle of the desert, a place that has a great history of being home to bandits and outlaws.    In this movie, there's a man who lives on an abandoned mine - he's the last man left.  They find him there with a gun, and it appears he's not the first one to come to that place... there are old ruins - probably inhabited by the locals.  But even that ain't enough to get the man to leave the mine.  When the old man wants him to leave, the man goes with him.  He's on his way to a town.  And he's very much alive.  It's not very interesting.  Some of the scenes just look as if they were shot in a cheap B-movies, especially when the old guy tries to scare the man away by making the sign of the cross.  I'll say this - there are a lot of "sick" movie scenes here.  There's a lot about the old mine that could've been used in any movie...  The way the old folks talk is really funny...  But there are also a lot moments of horror that make you feel sick...   The ending is really eerie.  Not as a supernatural, but as a guy looking for the people who once lived in the mine - and who are now dead...  It was an intriguing movie - although it is a little too long.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is not for everyone. It is a strange mix of science fiction, fantasy and horror. However, if you like the films that have come out in the last few years like. The Fifth Element or the Planet of the Apes, this will be right up your alley. The characters are well drawn and the movie seems to be an homage to the old classics from the sixties and seventies, i.e. The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, The Island of Doctor Moreau etc.   I think that this is a very good movie and it is definitely worth checking out.

I also like that it isn't afraid to look at how the current American government has been undermining the American way of life.   The ending is somewhat dissatisfying, but the first half of the movie is fascinating, and I'm glad to see a movie about the American war effort from a different perspective.

The soldier (Robert Redford) is an American who has just finished a tour in France when the war ends. He's returning to the States where his wife and children have left him. He arrives back in Chicago from his last tour of duty. His family lives and lives in a trailer park.   As a man coming from the Great War, I liked that he could still be so optimistic about the new generation of young soldiers that were now arriving in Chicago.  The war itself was a fascinating subject. Even more so the German propaganda.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What I like about this movie is that it shows how much things have changed. I saw it when it came out in 1983 and I saw a scene where one of the people is smoking a cigarette and he looks up and notices the stars and he thinks about them for a moment then his eyes close and he goes into a trance and the scene fades to black. I've seen it a few times since then and the scenes still seem to me to be about the stars as opposed to the world. The only things we get to see now are the stars. And this one is really nice. The special effects are very nice and the actors are great in every way. If you like good horror movies and sci fi then this is one you should not miss! The title of this movie means "You will come home" and if you do like that type of movie then you won't be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm so happy I finally watched this movie. This is a story about a young boy who is lost in the woods, and then a man with a gun comes and rescues him. He is then sent away from the man with the gun and finds himself in an old house on a hill. The man there knows about the lost boy, and takes the boy home, where he lives happily with a little girl who is very pretty. When they are about to be married, a man comes to the man and says there is a young woman in the house, but it is not the young woman she is told about. He tells the young boy where she is hidden. The boy goes into the house and is caught by the man. He tries to talk with the man, to get the man's sympathy, to tell him what he needs, but the man does not listen to him. Then the boy is forced to take a knife and cut his wrists. The mother arrives in the room, and the man tells the mother how sorry he is about the boy's loss, and how he has tried to help the boy as much as he could. But the boy has lost his way. He knows only two words: "Where are you going?" and "Where is the fire?" This is the story the mother tells the boy, telling him she will wait for him outside.  This is a great film, but I was disappointed in the ending.   If you haven't seen this movie, please go ahead and see it. It was very well made, and an interesting story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As an early 80s kid who was a huge fan of the Star Wars films, The Empire Strikes Back is one of the top films in my personal favorite list.   When I first saw the film in 1980 I recall walking out of the theater with my arms crossed and my heart pounding.  This is a film that will never be forgotten.  Even by the generation of people that saw it then, The Force Awakens has made this film even more special than the other original trilogy movies.  I also recall my father talking about this film on a daily basis.  My dad was a big Star Wars fan and this film was always talked about in our house.  In fact, it was our first movie ever.  After seeing this film I was determined to one day be as big a fan as he was. I am not sure if this film is for you, but if you want to see an action packed adventure with a great score and an awesome character turn from an all-time great actor this film would be a great choice for your viewing pleasure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a beautiful movie, with beautiful acting, beautiful direction, and stunning cinematography.   The setting is rich and lovely, and the film follows the wonderful story of a beautiful girl who is torn between her father, the Prince of Pisa, and her aunt, the Queen of England.  The girl's aunt is very jealous of the prince's love and is a very demanding and possessive person.  When the girls are going to their father's castle for a party, the aunt starts to harass the girl's father for his attentions. The father starts to turn his jealousy into a love for the girl.  It is really beautiful in every scene, and I love the acting that has been done.  This movie does get quite sappy, at times, but it isn't long before it stops being sappy.  But the ending is beautiful, and it is well told.  I really did enjoy this movie, and if you haven't seen this movie yet, then I recommend that you do!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the best films of all time. The director (Jean-Pierre Melville) had a talent for creating very complex and well balanced stories, that were perfectly woven into an amazingly well-constructed structure, a film that was filled with many emotional moments, both on the one hand and on the other.  There is no doubt that Jean-Pierre and his camera crew created an extremely strong film with a story that was full of mystery, that gave the feeling that this film was really made on a little budget with a very simple but interesting premise: A group of young people find themselves in the city of Paris, where they suddenly discover something strange that is causing all kinds of riddles and mysterious happenings.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A really, really good movie, but a pretty poor one to boot.  It is a film that is mostly about some children who visit some old people and play together.    The old people, who are about 60, can't play much with a four year old, but they do it all.  And they are very amused when the little boy makes a "dumb" move and gets stuck in some branches.  So, the old people begin to give the little boys various tasks, and it is a good kind of children's movie, with plenty of slapstick and slapdash and slapsticky and slap-dodge and slapdodge-latch, and with a lot of "d'aaaww"s, and lots of "aaaahs", and the occasional "Oooh" in the background, and the whole time there are some great musical numbers, by the old folks.  It is a little bit strange that we don't hear anything of the old guys themselves at all, but it is easy to imagine how fascinating they must have been in their younger years.  They do a good job of portraying them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's no better way to spend your weekend than to spend it with The Rock. While the movie itself is pretty entertaining, you have to keep an open mind. This isn't a classic action flick. It's a comedy and it works very well. The Rock doesn't have the acting chops to carry an entire movie. He does have the charm though. This movie is fun and really doesn't take itself too seriously. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to a friend's house in West Hollywood to watch a movie (I did not have to do anything special. My friend has a big collection of old movies.) and was absolutely blown away. I have not been impressed much since watching "Rabid Dog." I do not have a big dog so it will be hard to say that he is even remotely a dog, but he still has that big goofy grin that seems to be all that has ever stayed together in my mind's eye. I just wish he had more personality! I hope that he will do better than the original. I love it!! --

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm glad I saw this one. It was more well-done than most of the crap you see on the big screen these days and has a much more interesting story than many of the trashy movies that are released from big studios these days.  The action scenes were good and the writing was decent.   There's also a pretty cool ending that I'm not sure if I need to tell you.  If you like action films and a good story, this is the movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a good idea when you can take something with a "villain-ness" and make it a good character. This story, though not being well known in the US, has a great screenplay by John Sturges. It is certainly not the greatest movie, but it is one of the most exciting and thrilling. And if you love action movies, it is certainly worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a good one. A lot of people are going to say this is a "bad movie" and maybe they are correct. It is not a very good film. The characters are not very likable. The dialogue is not very good. The plot is not really good either. The acting is OK, the music is OK. The special effects are ok. But at the end, I felt so bad for this film. I know I know, this is an independent movie. The director may have felt that his film would be better on the small screen. But it was not. This is not the kind of film one would want to see in a movie theatre. This film is only for an audience of the mind. You should be watching the movie on TV. This movie was too bad to be a real film.

Our reply was a unanimous "Yeah!"  The movie is good fun as it shows the daily problems of a family living in one of the worst neighborhoods in Manhattan.   One night one of them is playing cards and decides to put a ten dollar piece in his mouth, thinking it'll taste better.  What happens next is priceless.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the best of the first batch of films from the '70s.  It has some great moments, some good writing, some great songs (even if a lot of the lines are in French), and some very cool-looking cars (in one sequence there's a scene of a Ferrari that gets a flat tyre and a Mercedes that gets pulled up by a crane, and the Ferrari drives on a motorway).  The car chase sequences in general are very cool, with some very slick chase scenes involving a Mercedes with a helicopter hovering in the clouds and some big trucks in the desert.  I also loved the way the films were filmed, and I don't mean this as a complaint - in fact it's one of the reasons I've been able to appreciate it so much over the years.  There's really nothing else like this for me in the VHS collection. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My mom told me that the movie was called "Einstein on Being a Man". My first reaction upon watching it was "What? What?" I really had no idea what that movie was about. I had never heard of Einstein! But now I think I know. I found this movie entertaining at first, and it got better and better. It got too good to be true! What a strange movie! Einstein is just a typical man with a good brain that is able to work out the answers to all of life's problems. The movie begins at the moment when Einstein is in his dorm room, studying. He decides to take a walk outside of his room, and a strange phenomenon happens. A big, blue car drives by, which looks a lot like an airplane. Einstein thinks that it is a UFO, and he runs outside to investigate. The strange car turns out to be actually a big, beautiful, blue, two-winged, jet-powered, flying saucer. The people on board look like super models, but there is something more sinister that is happening. When the people on this craft notice Einstein, they begin to get nervous. They are terrified and begin to run around like a bunch of chickens. Einstein has no idea who these people are and can't figure out what is wrong with them. After a little while, they start to fall asleep. The alien beings start to get more and more hostile as time passes. One of the aliens says to Einstein, "We have been watching you since we saw you at the World Fair in St. Louis in 1908." So Einstein does what any sane person would do in that situation. He tells them exactly where he lives! Now, these men are obviously not from this planet. They can travel great distances in such a short time. They also have a powerful radar that can see objects at a distance of millions of miles. So you can see from here who were the ones who came from the future to watch Einstein study on Earth. Einstein is also not an idiot. He is able, to figure out that this is the work of some other strange beings. So he decides to tell these guys what is going on. He figures out that it was the work one of their "time-travelers." It turns out that they have all kinds of other time machines. It turns into a big argument between Einstein and these time travelers, with Einstein arguing with the others who have a very different idea about what is really going on here

But then I remembered that there were a few episodes of the first season I had seen before the first animated series and I was hooked! I'm glad I saw it because now I get to do a little reading of Bruce Wayne's journal during the whole series which I did not understand until later. I'm not much of a comic book fan, but this is one series that I will check out again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You can not do a movie better than this one!   As a result of the huge success of the original "Cars", the producers decided to take the car-salesman and his gang and put them in "Cats" ( the popular cartoon characters of the era) and they are very much a part of the movie.   Although the car scene is quite short in the film, I still recommend it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I saw the title I assumed this was a parody of the American movie "Hollywood Squares" and "Curb Your Enthusiasm" I was surprised to see it was "Star Trek: Insurrection"! I have to say that even though this is a parody, it is one of the best I have seen in a long time. Not only is it funny, witty and a lot of fun to watch, it's also a clever sci-fi story that is well made. The only thing I would have liked to see changed would have been the part in the movie where Kirk is shown being attacked by a giant shark. That wasn't an attack by a shark, it was an attack from an alien who looks very similar to Star Trek: The Next Generation's Worf.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was really surprised to see that David O.

This movie is about some aspiring actors in New York who go to LA and try to find success. This was my first David O Russell movie and it didn't disappoint. If you like big budget, expensive pictures in which a lot is said but nothing is shown, you'll like this one a lot. It's a good, cheap, low budget, fast-paced, entertaining little film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There was one scene that really put that big, bad dragon in my heart.   It was a beautiful sequence from beginning to end.  The dragon, the dragons, the magic, the love, the laughter, the music.  If you have ever liked a movie from the 90's like the dragons in "Ragnarok"   then this is the movie for you.  And I enjoyed it, I enjoyed every bit of it.  Now, to the point:  So...why am I giving the movie 3 stars?  I'd give it 2 if it weren't for one minor thing.  I didn't notice this for a long time.  But one day...just one day, I noticed it. And now, I have to give it 3 stars...because what a great movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're a fan of film noir, then this is a great movie and a great time too.   While not strictly noir (there are plenty of nods to the more romantic aspects of movie noir in this movie), the idea of a detective looking for her missing daughter and following clues from a seemingly insane serial killer is one of the most original and entertaining genres of film history.  A nice bit of movie trivia, at the time this was filmed, the most well-known and most successful movie noirs were The Man Who Knew Too Much, Bonnie and Clyde, and The Untouchables.   The movie opens with a long scene of police trying to convince a man to tell them where his daughter was being held.  The man, played by William Holden, is not sure if he is telling the truth or not, but he is certain he is a very smart person who is looking for his daughter.  In the middle of the story, a mysterious man called Jack Torrance comes over to the detective to tell her about a very interesting case.  He says that he has done this type of thing many times in the past and he will do it again. This is followed by a quick montage of the detective's past work.  Jack, who has an accent of some sort (probably American-accented), takes some strange pills with him and is immediately transformed into a deranged and grotesque monster that roams around the house looking for the missing girl.  As the story progresses, the detective is able to work out that Jack is no longer Jack Torrence.  She decides she needs to speak to a doctor to find out if there's a cure for the strange illness Jack has been plagued with for years.  We don't actually see Jack in this part of the film, and it's very hard to tell exactly where we are in time.  Some say he was a "monster" to begin with and he just turned into a monster.  But I'm sure we have more than one theory out there about how it happened (which is an amazing plot device as all sorts of things happen along the way).   I liked the idea that this was the work of someone who was obviously obsessed and that there had to be more to it all.  I loved the detective/monster part of Jack.  It was an effective way of bringing a bit more tension to the movie, but I did think the monster part was

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie takes a very unique approach to a story about a family who lives in a town that isn't really a town; it's a huge house that's just in the middle of nowhere. And, in this movie, things only get stranger as the husband (William Shatner) takes to trying to get his family back to their old town, while the wife (Natalie Wood) decides to stay at the house and try to make it livable. What sets this movie apart from others of its kind is the use of the silent film style, which gives a whole new aspect to the story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think the movie is actually quite well acted, at least for the first half. There is a nice contrast between the nice lady and her husband (David Oyelowo) - at first he seems almost saintly. After all, he is the guy who finds and restores a beautiful violin by hand (which has been in a museum for more than 40 years), even though its worth (he has a good voice too) a million dollar. After a while, however, he starts to think that this isn't a violin at all - that the world of music is all about making money. He wants to get in on it, but the world doesn't seem to want him... The story is quite silly - there is some sort of conspiracy that involves a bunch of young musicians trying to score big deals for themselves by playing their own work. There are some amusing one-liners - the "humble" lady is portrayed as a bit of a prima donna and the guy is more interested in the violin. But ultimately, this is just a lot of fun - and the movie manages to keep the tension high at the end, despite the fact that all the characters seem to be quite one-dimensional. So, a fun little movie that is fairly funny even at the expense of having a few characters who are flat-out annoying (which might make it easier to watch as a teen).

The story has a twist that would really get a laugh out of the average person.  It's set in the year 2013 and we're all about to lose our minds over the birth of a boy who's a miracle.   This is an example of a movie that is fun to look at, but that gets deeper and deeper the further we go.  I loved this movie with every part of my being.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cary Grant was in every sense of the word an actor of great stature.  He played the bad guy, but even this role was far from the baddest.    Cary Grant's role as the scheming, corrupt Mayor Baldwin in The Godfather Part II is the epitome of a great performance.  His voice is great, his acting is great and his sense of irony is incredible.  While it is not his best role, it is the one that most perfectly encapsulates all of Cary Grant's character flaws.  Cary Grant was a brilliant actor.  This character is probably one of the worst of his career, but that doesn't lessen the greatness that is contained within. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A movie that is really unique is that it doesn't take itself seriously. It is very lighthearted, and it's an interesting story that focuses on a couple that fall in love and have an intimate relationship. The film is about their first encounter and their relationship. This film is very entertaining, and has an interesting message about love and romance. It has it's fair share of good dialogue and nice scenes to entertain the audience. I liked this movie very much, and I'm sure it will keep you entertained for a while. It's one of those lighthearted love stories that I'm glad to see, because there's a lot of bad stories about "normal" love relationships.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few years ago the movie "Punch Drunk Love" was released on DVD and since then I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I found the screenplay brilliant and, unlike the book and screenplay by Larry Kramer, I found both the characters interesting and well-written. The movie was so exciting, the music was so energetic, and the whole movie was filled with sex. This is an unusual movie in that every scene is full of sex and some scenes are especially memorable. The sex scenes are great and I think the movie would be more popular if the sex scenes weren't so frequent. However, I think that when you do a lot of sex scenes and you cut together so many different characters, the result is so much more interesting than the movie itself, and I do not think anyone who can watch the movie will not find at least a little bit of eroticism in it. The fact that the characters are so sexually attracted to each other is also something that is very good. It is great to watch these two sexy lovers, each with different bodies, try out different positions and techniques that are appropriate for each other. Their sex is very imaginative and a lot more than the average movie about sex would ever dare to be.

The rest of the story is one of how these men who thought they had found the edge of civilization are forced to survive at the edge.

And we see a little girl playing with a toy helicopter. There's also an adult guy, probably the grandfather who came in the house a few hours ago.   He's not dressed up like a cowboy or some sort of bad ass outlaw, but more like a down to earth, friendly guy who wants to play cards. It's funny how the movie has some very nice scenes like that, some of which are rather silly and even a little bit cheesy, but at least they aren't all stupid.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a very good old story (as in the 18th century) and one of the most beloved movies of all time. I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid but it is an old favorite. Some of the cast were very famous at the time (like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall) and had to act for very good money so I had to go to the movies to see them act. If you loved movies when you were a kid then you will love this movie as a grownup.   If you like a good old adventure story with a twist or two you will also like this movie. This movie is based on an old English fairy tale written by Sir Walter Scott. This story is also one of those "you just can't put a finger on it" type of mysteries where you can't quite quite put your finger on the meaning. However, as you will see by the end of the film there is a clear meaning hidden in the story that you will have to figure out. This kind of mystery is a lot more fun to do on the stage then on the silver screen. The main characters are all very interesting and the director never loses sight of them. For example, we have the great Humphrey (who is as good a bad guy as you can imagine), who is a real bully and a great actor. We also have the beautiful Lauren Bacalon. She is a bit like the "Madame Curie" or the "The Great Gatsby" of the story. I especially liked Lauren and she always has the best line in the movie. It is always fun watching the cast go through a variety of different emotions in the course of the movie which is one of my favorite things to do in a movie. There are a few comedy moments too in the film like a dog falling out of a window and the time the doctor visits the village to fix a car.  , 4.5 out of 5, was last modified: by

I just thought it was an entertaining movie that had good humor.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this film, there is an interesting story about a father who takes a trip on his skateboard to try to prove that his son (a pro skateboarder) isn't that bad. He ends up staying there for a couple of weeks, after which the father makes plans to return to New York. One night, he finds that the son has broken into the home of another skating pro (which means they're in love with each other). It soon becomes clear to the dad that his kid isn't going to skate all that well.  One way of saving the day is for the skateboarders to practice, which seems to have the desired effect: the son ends up skating better than his father at home and on the skate board. But the dad is still a bad skater (a big deal, considering he's the only skater in a movie).  Soon, the dad has to go back to NewYork City (the mother's hometown), and there, he is forced to face the fact that the skateboarding world isn't all that much different from the old, old world. ___________________ What a great movie!  It was a pretty good movie in its own right (like most of those made in the mid-90's), but it really shines in the "behind the scenes" material.

There were the requisite explosions in this movie and a few funny bits, but they seemed a lot more fun than the movie was and it was too bad, because that movie would have been better than most comedies. The humor was pretty good, though, and I do remember a couple of the actors' names from the film.

It's not a great movie by a long shot, but its one of the few that's true to the idea of the "old school" style of martial arts that I remember watching all the time as a kid.    Well, now the original title of this movie "The Master" has been changed to "The Man From Shaolin".   I don't know about you, but that sounds like a better title.  It seems like the plot goes out of control, however the film isn't half bad either.  I like this movie quite a bit.  So what did you think?  Leave a comment below!

The story is about a young girl and a young boy, who go to the Moon on a little boat to shoot "moonbows", a big bright light which is shot up from a special sort of cannon attached to the surface of the Moon.   (The title is actually the name of the place where the young woman and boy stay. )   It's a fun little story to tell, and it's certainly not the most imaginative thing I've seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, this film is absolutely breathtaking. It is so good you can't believe that the production values are that good and that the music is that good. It takes a while to get over the fact that it's about a car, but once you start, it's difficult to stop.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie on a great subject: the dangers of our over-stimulated culture and the value of solitude.  It has its share of dark, brooding, and bleak moments, but there is also a wonderful love story at its heart that is both touching and funny all at the same time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It's a movie about the people of the South, a poor, sick and dying region, a region full of bad people, who are being treated to Hollywood movies, all in the name of progress."    My favorite line in the movie is right before it begins, when John Wayne is introduced as a young guy with a dream. That dream is to be a major movie star. Then he gets to the audition: "If it ain't funny, I don't know what is."  It was one of those rare, genuine laugh-out-loud moments.   I'm not sure how much of the plot of the movie could have possibly worked in the real South, where there's no movie stars, where poverty and disease are the norm, where the poor folks are always getting screwed over by big business.  But there's still something about this movie that's so perfect: there are plenty of good parts and bad parts, but at the same time everything works.  The first act is kind of a hodgepodge of an opening, where John Wayne tries to get a job at a big Hollywood film studio (he's too old and too fat to be good at it) and, while it's funny, it does not exactly portray the South in a great light.  Then things get really good, as John Wayne goes to Mississippi and meets a lot of people on the plantation.  These are the people who gave the movie its title: the "people of the south," who were all the bad guys that had to die and be eaten to make the Hollywood movies.  So that was great: they actually used the real people of Tennessee in their film.  And then, of course, John Wayne runs into some bad actors trying to get into his movie ("You must play this part like a big man"), so he goes to the big studio, where a lot more people want to join, and they all turn up and all work together to make a movie.  John Wayne and his colleagues then try to save the South and the movie and, of Course, John's movie, "Stagecoach" gets it all right.  It is also a comedy that's a lot funnier than some of the other films of the period that come before it and, in general, just a great movie.     The first half of the film is great, but once it gets into the good part, where they actually have to play the parts
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a little disconcerting to see a movie that tries to be so sophisticated, and then it uses a lot of the same old tricks to try to be more sophisticated, which is rather sad. But the main characters are funny and the plot does move along, but I am not sure it will be remembered for many years.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a strange thing that even though I have only seen this once, I feel the need to make a review about it:  I have not seen the original Star Trek TV series or its films, but I have seen the films based on the TV show. These films have a very different feel than the TV series, and even though they are based on a TV show, they have a different atmosphere, which I have enjoyed.  These films are definitely for the Star Trek fans, but a fan of the film Star Trek is likely to enjoy them too.  The first film is about Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the Enterprise crew trying to stop an alien race from destroying Earth, which is a story that was very different from the TV shows.  It had a different storyline, which was a welcome change.  In addition, this film is also a good love story, as Kirk has to learn how to fall in love with someone and McCoy has to find a way to help Kirk.  Spock, who is not usually portrayed as romantic, plays a big role in this story.  There is also the threat of the planet that has been destroying the human race.  With the threat comes some new equipment the crew has never seen before.  I did enjoy the ending, which shows how bad things are when people take their dreams too seriously.  Overall, I enjoyed the films more than the series.  The Next Generation  It may be hard to believe that the series that started it all was only just renewed.  However, there is no reason to worry, as the current shows are all good.  Star Trek: The Next Generation is all about space.   The series has some good episodes and some bad episodes.  First, there are episodes that were written to fit a specific time, for example "The Inner Light".  The next one, "The Outrageous Okona", is about a woman who is upset about her life being taken away from her.  This episode has some very nice acting, and I really felt for the character.  "The Naked Now" is an example of a typical Star Trek episode, and it is a good episode.  At the end of the episode, you do see the crew celebrating.  Unfortunately, it does not go that way, as their ship is attacked, and they are trapped inside.  A very typical Star Fleet episode, but with good acting.  Next, is "The Schizoid Man
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Serenity  is a good drama.  It may not have the same sparkle and brilliance that Star Trek or Firefly have but it has that sparkle to it.   It's not a huge action movie like Guardians of the Galaxy or Alien.  The villains are a bit underdeveloped.  A good villain is only memorable when you have a good protagonist.  It has a lot of action including some nice sword fighting and space ship fighting.  There are some really good set pieces in the movie.  I would love to have seen a little more character development for some of the minor characters.    Overall a good fun film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're a fan of David Lynch, this movie is right up your alley. It's an odd little sci-fi film that's got all the right ingredients: dark humor, beautiful cinematography, a sense of place, a good mystery and, of course, Lynch, the perfect director of choice.   In a nutshell: a woman travels to a distant planet with the intention of stealing the brain of the human being that invented the planet's power source -- a blue planet that seems to be the only source of light on this starless planet.  In case you missed it, you might remember the plot: a female android travels to planet Earth, steals its brains, and travels back to that same planet in order to steal the brains of the next people on that planet. Of course, the other people on the planet aren't too happy about this invasion, so the female android is forced to find a new planet. As you might imagine, this is a pretty long movie.  I won't go into a ton of details about it, as there aren't a lot of spoilers. Instead, let me just tell you a bit about one of the main characters, a man named Robert, and the one character I'd like to share with you:  So what's great about this movie? I'd say that it's the story, the story of a man trying to steal brains and travel to a place that might be called the planet of the bluer skies. It sounds kind of crazy, right? This movie is an oddity for sure. It doesn't have a whole lot going for it, but it's definitely interesting.  This film was released in 1979. It has been on my list ever since I discovered it. I would say that this is the pinnacle of David Cronenberg's weird movies, and it still remains one of my favorites.  My rating:  "Somewhere in the Universe is a Red Planet and a Blue."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The second half of this movie gets better and better.  Not only are the scenes more funny, but they also feel more like part of a movie.    They are set in a small town in Iowa (I don't remember the state of where I live) where people don't get along.  I had a lot of fun watching this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I love how it's a mixture of different genres and approaches. It is full of humor and light moments that make it just the right balance of good science and fun. The story, though it doesn't exactly start with a bang, and isn't terribly memorable until a few chapters in, is actually good. It just has that quirky charm that all great sci-fi movies have; you know that one, the one about the "ghostly" ghost of an ancient alien spacecraft that suddenly appears out of nowhere? That is the story of a woman who believes it's haunted and that the ghost is attacking her.   "Ghost of An Ancient UFO."   It might be the best trailer ever: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is great and has enough originality to keep you going.  The story is simple and easy to follow: a guy meets a girl who gets the crap beat out of her.  Then comes the car and a quick trip to a small town, which is a perfect setting for a movie set in the American West.  But what is really amazing is that it takes a lot of little things to work together to give us a really entertaining film.  For one thing, it is very funny.  A lot of the jokes are the guy and the girl doing things in the car that make you laugh, but then all of a sudden the car does something totally unexpected.  It makes you think of all the things that can happen in a small, quiet town that is perfectly set up to be a movie town.  As you watch it unfold it is easy to see that this is going to be something more than just a movie.  You can't help but smile along as it all plays out.   This is a really fun movie that I recommend to all Western movie fans.  I also recommend this film to the movie lovers among you, as it is a little film and you don't have to pay a lot for it.  If you liked the movies from Steven Spielberg, then this is one movie that you would definitely want to check out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about a woman whose family comes back to live in the neighborhood she grew up in after her father died from cancer. The old man who's there to care for them is not the man to take them to the movie...I mean, there's just not that much going on. You need to keep a close eye on this movie as it will get into some intense, dark situations. But for a horror movie, this is actually quite good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best films ever made. It is very much like the classic film: a little boy is taken to an abandoned house and discovers an old lady who has the power to take children away from their parents and take them back again. At the age of 3, the little boy, Will, is able to save himself and the mother in a race to escape. The film is wonderfully paced, and it takes a long time to get to the "good" parts, but once you are there, you're in for a very good time. For the older audience, this movie is a great place to start learning about children's movies, and even today some of the children's films I have seen are just as good. If you like that style of movie, don't miss out. (It's on DVD, which is the best thing. DVD is more than enough!) One of the very good features of this movie: it is very true to its source material. This is the only reason the movie stands out as a classic. That film is not much different from the one in this movie, except that, in this version, the mother has been taken away by the elderly man and her daughter is only a child. That is a big difference!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is like a cross between Lord of the Flies and the Godfather: all the men are bad, the women are all bad and the kids are bad.  It's a really bad movie with some really bad dialog that would be right at home in a kids tv show or something.  The plot is very simple.   The kids are out playing in the woods.  They are caught by the adults, who then force them to stay in a house, under the watchful eye of their father.  There is also a black panther who appears to be guarding the house and is never quite seen again.  At this point in the plot we also learn the fate of the kids' father. He seems like a good man.  He never lets the kids out of his sight and is always the first person in and out of the house.  This might be a bad guy until he meets the one thing that can turn this scenario in a good way:   An old lady ( I think) that happens to live next door.  She is a good friend of the father, and she seems to love the kids.  In the course of the movie she takes pity on the kids and takes them out in to the forest and teaches them how to play.  It's a very sad and very funny story.   I love this movie and I'll never forget it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was born and raised near San Diego (I was a "Boys' Town" kid). That's where I first saw, in a theater, "Back To The Future". It is the most entertaining and enjoyable movie of my lifetime. Michael J. Fox plays Biff Tannen, who gets caught by the police when they attempt to apprehend the criminal who took a time machine. He then meets his grandson Doc (Michael J. Garcia). Doc is very bright and a bit of a smart aleck, like his grandfather. He has the same kind of charisma that Biff had. Michael F. J. Gennaro, played Doc's grandfather "Gordy" Gennarro. He is one of the coolest and most memorable villains I have ever seen portrayed.  He plays Gennarito well! The only downside is that he is played by a woman with a voice like a woman. I always thought it was funny when you see Biff yelling at Gennarus and the women around him (in the movies) talking a "tongue-twister" in the middle of a conversation. Biff, on the other hand, is always in a good mood. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a great fun movie with a good plot. You know that you are not in Kansas anymore when you see an old house with a sign in it. At the same time, you also see what it is you think it is, a place where the government did a horrible thing to the poor people. The government took the poor families that were all out of work and they put them in one house and they just kept bringing people back and people were put back in the house, with the old people. It really is a bad old house that looks like it hasn't been lived in in decades. What was really nice was the part where the old lady (that you think is a girl) tries to explain that they are not bad people. They are people who lived in the old country all their lives. There were lots of them and they all suffered in the end. When you think about it, the people in the movie are really not bad. The only bad thing about this film is the ending. It's not very satisfying.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the few times when a story is told to us that is so realistic it hurts the heart. There was nothing subtle about what happened to my mother and her two young children that day. As I walked to the bus stop that morning I wondered where the children could have gone so badly so quickly? My mother and I lived across the street from a neighbor family. Their kids often played in the grass and on the playground.   The neighbor family had a few older children. They all came running over to the two young girls playing on the hill behind their house. One girl seemed to be having a bad day. She had been in trouble with a few people and was being yelled at by a few boys. The neighbors' girls were so upset by the incident that they had decided to let the girls play for a bit and then go inside to cool off.  I could see in the rearview mirror that the girls had been playing together. It was clear that something had happened to either the one girl or the younger children to upset them.  The mother walked to her vehicle and drove away. When she came back from the bus line she went inside. I remember how she seemed to look around with a sense of relief and how there was a puddle in the car. She drove away with her three children still strapped in her car and I knew she would be in trouble the next day.  My mother called her sister to let her know what had happened. When the next morning came the neighbors' children were nowhere to be found. My father went over to see if he could find them. He found their vehicles in the parking lot and a neighbor who had a camera that was recording what was happening.  They had both gone into the bushes. The neighbor had seen what had really happened that day and he decided to take a picture.   The photo he took is an old picture. The younger daughter was lying on the ground and her face was covered in blood. Her face is crusted with mud and her hair is in disarray.  It is a photo my mother never saw. She kept her picture in her pocket and forgot about it for many years.  While it was not an easy thing to do at the time the neighbors did a great job at finding her children and brought them back safely.  That is how this story ended. I don't know if my mother realized what had actually happened to her children on that day or how close it came to

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one is a little different, as it's a short film about a couple of guys who discover a magic gem that they believe could make any girl fall in love with them.  They sell it, but then find that the gem has changed its color as it is exposed to the ultraviolet light of the sun and is turning green.    This gem has been in a secret spot all these years because nobody knew where it was.  The film is also funny:   One of the main characters is actually a female who is a bit of a bitch and tends to go off on some random tangent (see the clip at the bottom).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... I was in the mood for a great western once and watched the western "Red River" and it was pretty good but it didn't really stick with me. So I saw "Red" and I really liked it.   It's really a great movie.  It was a time when the US was going to fight back and try to get out of the Second Great War in Europe.  A lot of the movie was on the border of California and Mexico.  They are fighting over gold and a group of bad guys.   This is also when Mexican forces were going to attack the California Gold Rush so this was definitely a good time to see.  My favorite part was the Mexican soldiers getting into the western town of Tijuana and killing everyone.  If you've ever wondered what it would be like to live in America in the late 19th and early 20th century you'll love it. I don't think it has been possible to make a good western in the United States since that wonderful movie. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who's interested in a great Western.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just finished this fantastic movie. I was able to see it on opening day in my college's theater. It was a great movie. The only bad thing about it is the plot. At the beginning of the movie we see the movie's premise: a college boy wants to win a baseball game, because he has the best arm. Then we see him start to win, and soon he becomes the star player. At first he starts to get a little jealous of the other kids in the game. When they get a chance to face off he gets a little annoyed (I didn't want to mention that), and we see a couple of shots of a man and a woman in an intense kissing scene. Then, the guy gets sick. He becomes paralyzed. There's nothing worse than to see a character die from his illness. Then the girl, the one with the great beauty, moves away, leaving the dumb, depressed, and sick kid alone. We see him go from the disabled to the star. He's thrilled. Then he meets this beautiful girl who reminds him of his past. They start to date and eventually a marriage is planned. After the wedding they have a big fight and the kid goes home and dies of his illness (he's in a wheelchair). We see the kid's dad go over to the house and see his son lying in the living room, with a dead body at the kitchen table (his sister has died) and no one is there to help. He cries. The dad goes over and the guy opens the house door and the dad sees that there's a big, empty spot. He gets angry and the dude says he's not gonna let a guy sit down right in front of his son's corpse (I loved that scene). Then the dad goes in and the guys comes out. The guy says he had a heart attack and he's going to die. The kid gets up and starts crying, but his dad tells him to stop. The dude tells him he has to wait for his dad. Then they go to bed. I'm sure a lot of people saw that movie and I'm not too surprised. It's a pretty depressing movie about a lonely person who doesn't know anyone and thinks he's in love. It is a movie I wouldn't be able to watch over and over again. What I liked the most about it was the relationship between the movie and the movie. It got so sad at some points that I just laughed. But then

I found God's speech about the importance of love and compassion very interesting and poignant. I was impressed by the way the movie portrayed how people are more easily manipulated than you would think. It was not the most subtle movie but it had great action and great set pieces. I would like to see the movie again and again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film begins with the title, and I guess that is an understatement. A group of high school students and one high school teacher, who is not even the teacher, is transported to another dimension and must contend with "evil" creatures that appear out of thin air. I must say that this film has some great ideas for what would be an interesting idea. In short, a group of teens get trapped in a dark tunnel. And from there, it gets progressively darker as they find themselves forced to explore the tunnel, trying to figure out what is going on.   One of the things that I particularly liked was how the school setting provided some fun action as the teenagers went on a crazy search for the exits or somehow find an exit. The only problem I had with this film is how long it takes. That said, the film does an excellent job of making the characters feel real and human at the same time. The actors are very good and the scenes are quite dark without being gory. I think that if the film could have kept going a little longer I am sure the story would have been great.  , Rated: R   ...More(Read full review)

It's the same bad script that's been making movies since, oh, the '50's. It was filmed with the help of several people who were in it, and it's a cheapie. It has poor acting, bad sets, a silly "love story," and a boring plot. I wish there was a "Love Story" made out of the scripts. I think you get the idea.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For me,   the   great   film   is the quintessential action movie.   It has a brilliant screenplay with a terrific cast of characters, it is the perfect blend of comedy, melodrama, thriller, science, drama.  It is, simply put, a great movie with an unforgettable villain.  The   villain of the piece, Dr. David Riggs, is an extreme genius but at the same time a complete and utter psychopath.  Riggs is a madman, the kind of madman who thinks he's being clever.  In a way he is, he's smart enough to make people believe that his inventions work when they don't, but he's also insanely cruel and cruel as an old man.  He's a sadistic, insane person who is at the end of his time and a life and he's determined to make that life as painful as possible.  His scheme is to kill all the scientists involved in a project that Riggs has set up on a remote island called New Grange.  This is to be a place where people can get "off the rails".  As a scientist, Riggs thinks that his island will let people escape from the human mind and from their need for control, but in reality it's just another mad experiment.  People who have no hope and who can't function in society are taken to New Grague and left there to die.  On the surface, the island looks like a beautiful paradise.  There are cottages and a farm, there are wild horses, there's a beach where people go for a day or two and it is, in fact, a beautiful place.  But there's something else going on.  And what's that?  You guessed it, Rigg's island is filled with crazed crazies.  These people don't just show up randomly and attack people; they're all on the island because Dr. Riggs sent them.  At first, some of these crazy people just want to kill the scientists and then they become crazies and kill people... and they can't get rid of them because they all live in the same island.  So the island is a death camp.  As the film progresses, the craziness intensifies but at a very slow rate.  Sometimes Riggs acts as if he's trying to bring calm to the crazy people but in the end they don' t feel like they
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me, the best thing about this film is the acting:  From the beginning we get to know that this movie is going to be all about a woman who is in love with a man. It's a classic love story, and it's so obvious that it's just going to get better. The film is quite simple - a woman named Julie (Carol Burnett) has been sent by her father to live with her in a small town by the sea. Julie finds a job teaching English and also teaches children to play the game of hide and seek. The town is rather small, and Julie and her father are on good terms with each other. She also has feelings for her teacher and his little son named Charlie (Tommy Lee Jones).  The first scene of the film is very moving, and the rest is filled with more feelings. The music and the editing are both very good.  Julie's father and the small town are rather small and charming. The only problem is the love of the woman for her husband.  It's so sad.  In spite of it all, the movie is a little bit sentimental.  After that there's another pretty good sequence where the woman and her husband are playing hide and go seek.  I wish that it wouldn't have ended with a happy ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's nothing quite like a good film. The whole movie could not be better in terms of a good story that is told with an enjoyable and exciting plot. A simple story that goes a bit over the top at times but, that's the nature of a story about a little girl and her pet dragon that she creates by drawing a picture out of some leaves that turns into a monster. But, in spite of that, this was still a good flick that you would definitely enjoy.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (I have already covered the main point of this movie in an earlier review and I will not expand on it again here.   The story takes place during the First World War and the theme of the film is the growing number of nations seeking for peace.  The first three-quarters of the movie concern the efforts of the British and Germans to gain an advantage for the "Free City of Zanzibar" (Africa, not "Zambia") by building the Zanzabar Naval Base.  Unfortunately, with the German defeat, the Allies can now build ships for all the countries in Europe and Asia!   This is obviously bad news for the British but they are not quite ready to give up.  They attempt to buy the French port of Algiers from the Germans but they do not get what they want.  Then, they attempt to negotiate with the French who demand much.  At the same time, the French attempt to get the British to sign the "Comintern Convention" (the infamous "peace treaty" that was signed with Stalin when Churchill was still Prime Minister).  We see the efforts to get a peace treaty, then a peace, and finally a peace which the British reject with a resounding "no".   As you can tell, this movie is filled with a whole bunch of different plot twists and twists and turns, which I don't think I'll ever see in a movie, as well as a bunch of memorable lines: "You're a damned fool if you think we can do this without bloodshed!" "He's an honest fellow. And a good man at that!" "You see, he's like a good wine, he doesn't age."   One of the more notable scenes of the entire film involves the British soldiers returning from the front in Germany after the "victory". We see them enjoying a celebratory feast after the war has been won.  And then suddenly the war is back.  One would think that the "good soldier" who doesn't feel much emotion about his victory would have a pretty hard time dealing with his emotions over losing a battle. However, when a German machine gun fires on a British soldier he simply stands and throws away his weapon.  It is difficult to describe just how powerful this scene is. As soon as the British soldier throws his weapon away the German machine-gunner points his weapon right at the British (at which point the British machine gunner gets
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first 30 minutes are a little cliche at times but then it builds itself into a great movie, the most memorable moment is the scene where they are searching for a lost soul, the entire movie is amazing. The plot is complex but still easy to follow (aside from the main characters being a little bit silly). It's a great idea.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like your action movies to be packed with explosions, fast-paced chase scenes, and the occasional scene of character growth, then you'll want to check out this one. I've always wondered why "Babylon 5" doesn't get more credit as one of the greatest science fiction TV shows ever made. After all, its cast, story line, and cast of characters are as fantastic as any other TV show I've watched. The premise is pretty simple. You've got a rag-tag group of humans (a military unit), who travel to a space station to report about some weird stuff that's happened to them. As a group, they're called "the 5" (since it's a series of five episodes each running a minute long). That's really it. We follow our main characters, Kosh, Rael, and Keel, along with their crewmates and a few other characters in their crew. The rest of the cast are the occasional aliens (the so-called "Babel"), and we get to see some of the other alien species (the "Morphs" and the "Tau") that are brought to this strange station, although none of them are really that important. I think it'd be fun to take a different approach to the show. Instead of seeing the main characters trying to figure out just where and what they're supposed to be doing, why the heck doesn't anyone else just say "F#@! It!"? They would then be saved the trouble of figuring out where to go next and how to get back to earth.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm going to give a thumbs down and a little love for one of the worst films of all time and one of my all time favorites to boot.  This is the type of movie I wish I had a copy of when I was a child.   It has a strong dose of horror, with a twist ending, but still somehow manages to be so ridiculous I have to smile with every line.  I love that little girl named Sally who is so small, and yet she is big as a house.  The little sister is a total brat, who acts like a grown-up when her sister isn't looking.  Even though she's supposed to be a little girl, she is actually a little boy who just happens to be about a foot taller than Sally.  It's so hard to explain just how insane this movie is.    It starts off with a small girl named Mavis running into a forest because she needs to find her mom.  Mavis is going to the place to take her mom to a funeral, but in doing so she bumps into the creepy looking old man.  At the time he looks like he might have some connection to Mavis, but the only thing that's certain is that he's got a really long and thin nose.  After Mavis tries to get her mother back she gets lost in the forest.  Once Mavis gets to the burial ground she finds a little baby and tells her not to tell anyone about where she was going or where she lived because she has to go to the town in order to get a new purse for herself, but it doesn't matter because Mavis isn't going home.  She just wants her mother, so she asks a couple of townsfolk for help.  One of them is Mr. B., and he's a pretty bad guy who seems to want to be like some of the other bad guys in the movie.  Mr. A, though, is the one that has the best line:  "You wouldn't believe it if you went to a small town where all the kids wear black."   Mmmm, that's good.  Meanwhile, Mavis has been looking for her mom and can't find her.  And so this old man shows up, only to get his nose broken by a little kid.  Of course, he's no longer a scary person, but this leads to more badness.  Now, this movie has the standard

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would like to say that I thought this was a good film. I mean this is not the worst movie I've seen (although that title probably should have been changed), but it did not quite manage to live up to the hype (and I am sure I will be surprised if the reviews are much better than mine!).  The movie takes the standard horror movie format, the young woman who is attacked and has to go through the motions of a ritual, only to be attacked and attacked. So the ritual ends and the woman wakes up. I did not really see much of what happened during the ritual, but from the first frame she was attacked in the back in a dark basement by a man with a hat.  We then see her walking out of the basement and onto a bus, the bus is being driven by a little girl, that girl seems to have a weird fear of the bus.  I think I may have found a theme going on here.   But I am not really sure, maybe the little girl is a witch or is trying to take the little witch down a level. This bus also seems to be possessed.  We see the boy on board. The kid seems to take a liking to the girl and they are talking to each other.  It is a strange film and not the kind of film I would want to see at a childrens party or to watch with friends in the afternoons.  What the film does have going for it is that it has a number of strong female characters, so it is not just one of those films that has a lot of sexual imagery.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best part of this movie is its soundtrack, it is great and catchy and reminds me of the late 80s.  The movie starts out with a very cute little girl with green eyes, named Lizzie and her father.  She is going on a camping trip with her father and her Uncle and her dog.  Unfortunately Lizzi gets a bad cold during her trip, and as they are trying to get back to camp, Lizzy's father suddenly has a heart attack.  And with a sudden death like that, Lill is left alone with her dog, and it looks like she is about to drown in the pond.  I think they should have put that scene in the last 30 seconds of the movie, or at the end, or something!  But nooo, her parents decide they must go on their trip and start leaving her behind.  Fortunately, Lizzy has a plan and she convinces her father to carry her through the stream of water to the camp.  Lizz is successful in the first half of the film, though she does manage to get sick at some points, and gets almost to the water.  What is so great about the plot is that it is just as simple as it could be, in fact, it's not that bad.  You watch the scenes and it doesn't even look complicated, in spite of the number of twists and turns they have to go through in order to get to where they are going.  A good movie, and a great soundtrack, so I say buy this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As most people know by now, Steven Spielberg's "Lincoln" is the ultimate historical drama for American cinema. The story, the cast, and the historical context all work in tandem to create a magnificent tale. There are few other movies in this category that match it to the extent that "Lincolns" does.   The film begins at a point in America's history that most people forget, but that is where Spielberg begins to tell his story. This is a story about a man who is more interested in being a man than anything else. And who gets his start in American politics by standing up to his own party and challenging the president to run on the Democratic ticket. His early political involvement is the first hint that he will become very successful, and he does so in no time at all. "Lionel" is about everything, but more importantly about nothing. "What Lincoln" does not focus on Lincoln's political victories, but rather on the life of a man as he sees his family. There is very little about him that seems real and even the story about his first presidential campaign seems rather manufactured. The acting is top-notch, the action is terrific, and there are a number of other great characters in "Lancs."   It is at this point that Spielberg begins his love affair with the medium. He uses the camera in a way that makes it feel very natural, not at all like a set for a movie. The film is not a dramatic piece, but a very interesting film that is at least interesting because it is so real. The music is terrific too. Spielberg knows when to let his camera do the work and when to use it. The camera stays very focused on the action, and at one point, just sits there looking rather strange. The other thing about the film is the fact that it has a lot of great songs. The score comes in two styles. One is a kind of a military type of music that emphasizes the war and sounds very much like it was put together on a piano or something. And then a very catchy song that is a little more country than you would expect from the film. This song is played very well and gives the film its signature feel and mood.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those films where the music alone makes it memorable.  While the first half is the usual "monster" movie cliché, there is something much more original than the usual gorefest, especially in the second half.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'd always thought that the great John Carpenter was quite a good director. I liked the little, little western he made a few years ago. And, of course, I loved the other movies that followed. I never thought I'd ever see the return of John Carpenter...but, then, I didn't really think John Carpenter, himself would make another film. Then I was shown The Thing (1982) and it changed everything for me. I am now a fan of John Milius. I like John Molo a lot. John Carpenter is not really a director I ever admired at all.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film takes a humorous approach to a complex subject which involves the CIA, the American Mafia, and the CIA's head, John Helms (Peter Finch), and his wife, Dr. Elizabeth Hinton (Margaret Dreyfuss).  Dr. Hinton runs a clinic in California which treats mental patients, and her husband is a retired CIA agent who works for a private firm, CTC, which is run by Dr. James (James Caan), who's the psychiatrist on Dr. Shelly (Dana Andrews) case and Dr. Paul (Bill Pullman) a psychiatrist and a former army man.  Dr Hinton is a bit eccentric (as are all American psychiatrists) so they are very intrigued by her, but the problem is that she also has ties with the other side of the fence.  As you would expect from a movie with such a heavy theme of mind control, it is often hard to get a handle on who is who.  It's a bit of a comedy but it has some serious issues in it.  The plot is interesting enough and the acting is good but I'm not sure if it was enough to make this film a classic.  However, the plot does tie into some other recent conspiracy films and I hope they don't start trying to remake all of those in the future, especially since they did a pretty good job of it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The title of this movie is a bit vague, as there is no real theme or storyline. There is certainly a bit of violence, but most of it is in the background, like a backdrop, or a soundtrack, or even in the mouth of a dead cow. I never realized that it was a movie of any kind. I always thought that the cow was being slaughtered by some bad guys. It is very depressing, and the violence makes it even more depressing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the end of the film, the audience learns that the reason the "good guys" always get their asses handed to them by the bad guys is because they are always just a little bit too good. One of the last shots is a man running along the bank of the Potomac and holding hands with another man who is also carrying on a conversation, and while running along, he turns and throws the other man in the river, but it was all in the name of saving his life, and then he starts to float. He then goes up to the river bank and starts climbing out of it. Then, as he climbs out of the water, he is caught in some sort of net which he manages to snap his fingers to, and with that the net is no longer there. He takes the net off the riverbank, grabs a stick, and climbs back into the water. Once he is out of water he takes out his stick and walks back to the bank. Suddenly, a large fish with two heads, the first of which is upside down, jumps out and grabs him by the leg, but the man is able to get away from it. At the top of the bank the man and the fish both fall into a river, and as soon as they're out of sight, a woman's voice can be heard. It says, "Oh, come on, I can't stand to watch this. My god, you must be kidding." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie with a good story, but this story is not really original. The main character is too much of a hero. But I didn't see anything bad in this movie, except, of course, the plot. If I saw it in a theatre, I would have liked to stay longer. I would not like it in the same cinema, but I am sure that, if shown in a commercial movie theatre in New York City, I must come here to see it. It might even be in one of the movie theatres.

I was never a fan of the original Devil's Advocates from Hell, but I was always curious about whether the movie could live up to the comic book.

If you're a fan this movie will be right up your alley. If you're not a fan, then you could probably do worse than watching it.

If only it weren't for the film's soundtrack. I like the music, but that one song is so cheesy and awful that it gives the rest of the film a bad name. The rest of it is also good, but if only it had been cut down to 3 or 4 minutes it would have been much better. I really hope I get to see this again someday soon. Get it while it's hot:  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If your movie is boring and no action, then you're going to have a tough time getting people to see it. This was a movie about people and the environment that they live in.  I wish this were filmed in Canada or a tropical country, instead of somewhere like this, but that's what the movie is about.   When someone complains that this movie has nothing to do with anything, well, they're not paying attention.  This movie is all about the people who live in a rural Ontario, Canada town.  If the movie was about animals, the movie would be "Wolverine: Planet of the Apes."   This isn't about a team of "evil" humans, it's about a small hamlet of people who want a better quality of life.  The problem is, if you don't know who these people are and what they want, then "A Dog's Life" could be any town in Canada.  My biggest problem with this movie is that it is too long for the time that it took to do the first 15 minutes.  A lot of action would have been nice, but there's also some decent acting in the first half of the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After seeing this movie, it's hard to say anything bad about it. It's been a while since I've been surprised by a movie, but this is a very good one. If anything, it has too much humour in it for me. But it's not bad in the slightest. It does all of this, and then some. There are lots of characters in it. All of them have some kind of depth to them. Most of them are actually quite interesting. They also seem to know how to use their characters, and use them to their advantage. I loved a lot of the characters. The only one that I didn't like was the one that was supposed to be the villain. I'm not really a fan of villains, so I thought that she was pretty annoying. But she was the only bad part of the movie. In all, a fun, interesting, and very entertaining little movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A young man who is searching for a girl has been taken in by the rich young widower. He has come to his door one day. The woman in the house is in her early twenties. She is very pretty. The man has heard from various relatives that she is interested in him. They have a good relationship, but she is clearly unhappy. The next morning, the woman comes by with a large bouquet of flowers. The young man is overjoyed, to say the least. She tells him not to get too excited, but he is. He shows her around and tells her his troubles. He can't meet the woman of his dreams on account of his lack of money. He tells her that his brother has died and he needs the money that will allow him to get the man of his dream. Then, the two walk along a river road. As the morning light is reflecting in the river, the young man thinks about what he said and what might happen. The river is a pretty little river, running through a beautiful setting where the birds can be heard chirping. It is an awfully peaceful setting for a young man to find himself at the head of a little boat and in love with a beautiful woman.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If a movie was made about an interracial relationship between two old Hollywood stars, it would be an incredibly racist, insulting, and crudely written, and it would still be a good picture. The plot is a travesty: a white man, a black man, and a mulatto, all live in Beverly Hills. One day the old black man takes a young woman to the house of his lover, who is white. Then they talk, the old white man is impressed with the young white woman's looks, and the young man thinks he has found the perfect wife, who looks like a movie star, and he is very pleased. The old black, who has seen enough of the world in which the old man has lived, thinks that his young mistress does not have what it takes to attract a white, and so he tries a little more subtly. At a dance, the mulatto gets all the white people to dance by dancing with a white woman. The white man has a very large party, and at the dance, a white girl dances with a black boy. The mulatto has been dancing in the background, and is amazed, but the white boy is just as fascinated by the mulattoes' movements as the girl. The movie opens with a closeup of a mulatta with a long face, a very long nose, a big round black mouth, and round black eyes. This mulatto is the lead actor and he appears in about twenty-seven of the seventy-two minutes of the film. His character is a good actor and his dialogue is very funny. For example, he says to the white girl, "I guess we have to do it, then. I'll be waiting for you over there." I don't think this movie would have been good had this poor, sad black had been portrayed by the white actor or his wife. That would have made the movie funnier than it is.

The acting is decent, especially the characters who are not quite as big and bad as their French counterparts, and they are not played by French actors either.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A little while ago I got into a discussion about the badness of The Da Vinci Code, a film that had a lot going for it, including a great movie star, an excellent script, and a very convincing premise.   My main reason for not giving it a very high grade was that I was pretty sure the film would fall into an obvious trap and not be able to escape it.  I was absolutely right.  There is a lot of stuff in the film that just looks like bullshit.  The Da Vincis are obviously a bunch of geniuses but they also look like they were made out of the same shit they are selling.  Even the script was bullshit. There were a lot less scenes and more exposition in this script than in the original.  So there you have it, the Da Vincis' IQs are measured in millions but their talent is measured in a few percent. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love movies and this one is a great one. This movie is set in England and it is quite well done in the way it is set up. What sets this apart from a lot of movie sets is how the characters react to the horrible death of a friend. The characters react very realistically to this death and you can tell they truly felt their friend was a part of their family and it was a loss they felt. Some of the acting was better than others, but I loved it. The movie is very different than most of the movies I had seen so far that were set in the same period of history. It's got a different tone and the direction isn't exactly clear, but it's very good. The actors are fantastic and the director did a great job in filming it. I am looking forward to the next movie set in this period.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (I can't believe I finally got to see the brilliant film that made director John Woo famous. I think we are all indebted to John Woo for being so daring, so bold, so funny, and so entertaining, without being over the top, which I think is the mark of a great director.)   This is John Woo's final movie as a director and it is a masterpiece.   A man is kidnapped and has to face a dangerous killer and the only way to escape is to kill a group of people who happen to look like his wife and son.  A group of actors are hired to play the part of the people that Woo wanted to be.  The film is based on a Japanese comic book that is about a man who travels to Japan to see his missing son. The kid turns out to be very different from the father and his family's expectations.  I am not sure what to say about this. It is one of those perfect films that does just about everything well.  This film is set in the past, it is set on a movie set, it has a killer, a murderer, and a woman who knows how to take care of a man.  In addition, it features the most beautiful scenery and most perfect shots.  After the first shot of the man being strapped to a gurney, I fell completely in love.  There were several interesting scenes that took me out of the film but the most memorable was the one where the assassin, who had killed another man, has him tied to a chair as the assassin's wife comes in to look at him.  Woo does an excellent job of showing us the way he does it: he cuts through his hair in several different ways and uses his fingers to do it.  When it is over, the man and his wife are still together and it looks like they never loved each other.  It is hard to believe that this was made in 1979, and I really enjoyed it. It had me laughing so hard I was crying.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best parts of this are the opening shots, so that is what you get! The film is about a guy who is obsessed with a dog who gets killed by a car. It would have been better if the person had been a dog. It then goes to a woman who keeps a pet tortoise, but it dies in the first day. The second day she goes to the cemetery and is told to remove the dead tortoise. After doing so she sees a cat with a broken tail that is a cross between a cat and a tortoise with a tail broken and a little cat face. She then sees a man walking with his hands behind his back. She is about to kill him when he drops a rock, which breaks the tortoise's tail. That is one of the funniest, and touching things in this movie. The film itself is an excellent comedy. I liked it much more than the movie I watched recently.   It might be hard to find a good book to watch on TV right now, but this is worth a try:  In the book I was listening to the first few minutes of, a little boy is watching a TV show and a guy talks to him like he's a baby. That, plus the humor was just funny to me. I could not bring myself to watch the TV show without this, and it is well worth watching a few episodes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a decent little thriller about a high school boy who is found in the woods and he discovers that he has a friend who is the daughter of the mayor. It's an average little thriller. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was pretty much a straight-up action movie. I love the characters and their backstories and their dynamic between the different characters.   The action scenes are quite satisfying.  If you like the James Bond films, you will find a lot of these guys to enjoy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's hard not to be blown away by the film. The art direction is great. The movie looks like a high concept movie with very little use of CGI.  The story is a good one as well: a college kid has to get a job to pay for the first year of college. But then the bad guy comes along. I wish there were more villains like this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm sure this movie will get more and more acclaim. This movie is a very well made, and thought provoking story. The story itself is very well told and told well. Although, I think that the movie can stand much better acting, more humor, better pacing, and less violence. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie from start to finish!   This is not a "good" movie, this is a "Great" movie!  When I first watched this film, I thought it was a low grade, low budget, low-budget, low movie with an uninteresting, one-dimensional, bad actor/bad film!  This one is different;   The movie starts out with a great deal of humor and then, once everything has happened, it gets very heavy.  In this movie, the whole thing looks like a really bad TV show.   So, what we get is this:  There is an aging rock-and-roll star who is a millionaire.  The woman is the girlfriend of the rock-star and has been sleeping with him for years.  But there's something wrong and the rock star keeps getting older.  It's up to the rock/rock star to do something to stop the aging... ...and he can't!  A bunch of guys, the rock and the women, all get together and start to do the same thing over and over again:  They lie about stuff; they take drugs and do cocaine.  They steal things.  There's lots of violence in this movie.  And the whole movie is about the rocker trying to stop himself from aging.  Then he meets one of his fans who is "younger".  And in one scene the woman is about to go on stage. ... and the guy she's sleeping with gets mad and starts to beat her up.  This isn't an unusual story line; this is the usual story line.  Now, the one exception to all this is there is a young woman, and she's not only younger, but she has a "beautiful face" and she does a song that is very sexy.  She's the one who's going to be the "gift" to the aging rocker.  So there is the "Gift" and it's a real young woman.  So now the aging, sad, sad rock star comes up with this plan:  He'll get one of the "young" women to be his girlfriend so he can pretend to be younger.  He figures that he'll be old soon enough so how the heck is he going to do it?  Then the rock gets the "girl" pregnant and gives her to the guy who was supposed to get her pregnant.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is based on a book by Richard Matheson and features an excellent performance by Ray Winstone. The story is about a man named John Riddick (Ray Winstone) who is stranded on a remote island off the coast of Alaska. After some time he is befriended by a grizzly bear (Bruce Greenwood) and he decides to stay on the island with him. They live in harmony until a killer whale appears and decimates the island. John and the bear escape and head for the mainland but they are captured by the government agents and are taken to a prison facility where a mysterious assassin (Robert Duvall) has been sent to eliminate Riddicky.    It's a great movie and very good action/thriller.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A group of friends in high school reunite to take a group trip to see a movie about an Englishman and an Eskimo. The film's tagline is "A tale of two brothers", with one of the brothers being played by Edward Woodward. His brother Jack, played by Tony Curtis, is a typical young man who enjoys going out and getting drunk at parties. Jack is also quite a ladies' man, having multiple love affairs with the beautiful girls in the town. The movie is good, though it has a lot of cheesy moments (which makes it more fun to watch). The acting is pretty good, and the music is great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen it a few times now and it is a very good movie. I guess this movie is a sequel to 'The Long Dark', which was a pretty good movie as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A fun and inventive movie about a schoolboy who goes up against a very dangerous (but well trained) bear who wants to eat him.  The bear has two big teeth, and his teeth are quite sharp, so that when his teeth dig into a body in an attack, it is quite painful, and this is a bear that is not a toy.   My only complaint is that if the bear was about to eat a human, he should have stopped before, and then come at the bear's head when the bear got angry enough. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only flaw is that they should have gone through a whole novel of dialogue with every character and changed the way they spoke in every instance for every character (which they could have easily done, by the way). But at least I liked this book, and I recommend it to anyone who is not a big science fiction fan: it is not all science fiction, but it is more than enough.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very much based on "Star Wars". This is not an obvious comparison, and a film that I was never really that fond of. This movie does have a fair number of surprises but the ending does not hold up to the rest of the movie. But then again, I was expecting a lot more from a prequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of how John Dillinger went from a gentle farmer in a small Iowa town to a murderous outlaw on the night of Halloween night in 1962 has long been told.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The ending of The Big Lebowski is pretty cool. I just don't like the film's dialogue in that it sounds like nothing but a bunch of idiots trying to be funny. I also found the film to be lacking any sort of artistic merit, it was just about how much they could cram into 2 hours.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have a soft spot for John Landis and his work. Landis is, like Mork, one of the few movie directors who really knows what he is doing and never backs down from what he says.  The reason I gave the movie a four is because I thought John Landiss took a risk in writing this.  It is not my style or my subject matter but I give it five stars for the sheer fun, humor, and weirdness.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had heard a lot about this film about a young couple that was living on a small rural farm in the American South and about the adventures of the young couple which was actually pretty much like a fairy tale of sorts. I was in my early teens and had seen pretty much everything. I hadn't seen a western, however, so I had no idea how bad this was. Not to speak ill of a poor man's life, but the writing was horrendous, to the point that I almost wanted to watch it again just to figure out how all this was done. I still think it is pretty good, even after all these years, but it is worth nothing compared to what other things were out then.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't really expect much out of this movie, and I wasn't even really looking forward to it. It stars a young girl (who also starred in a movie a few years ago called "Goddess") as she plays the role of a woman on trial for murder. The prosecutor is a pretty, but a little on the short side with a little girl as a victim. The judge is an extremely bad judge and all of the court room scenes are a bit silly in the least. But the girl is a good actress and so is the movie. There is no real drama in this movie. The film may be a little silly, but it has some pretty good acting, a nice story, and a good villain (who may have actually a little more to him than meets the eye). It is also a fun movie, with some funny moments. It may be the last time we see a young actress play the part of a pretty young woman, and so that is pretty good. The only thing missing is a little bit of action and an even bigger audience, but hey, I never expected much from this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a kid I always loved to watch the movie "Buster Keaton" with a friend. I even tried to imitate the acting.

A must-see for fans of the old "Crazy" movies and kids alike. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the best movie to come out in a long time. My favorite scene of the movie was the "Rapture of the Soul" as a whole. This movie, the story, the acting and the story was amazing. One of the most touching movies that I have seen recently. I liked the movie and liked that there were multiple scenes that did not focus on just one character. I think that this movie is a must see and one of those movies that you have to see at least once in your life.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie!   It is a funny movie that I don't care for.   The movie was filmed with great actors that do a good job.  I wish they would have gotten out of filming in one take and filmed for one hour in the church with all the lights off. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have a hard time believing that this movie actually existed. I don't get how a movie titled  "Frosty the Snowman" would make it to theaters. Well, I didn't either.  However, my friends did and we all liked it. I personally enjoyed the snowman and think that he looks great in this film. The Snowman looks great all winter and is a fun snowman to watch. The soundtrack was good, the lighting was good. It was very fun to watch a movie about a snowman.  I didn't even know that the Snowmen were in this movie! This is not a bad movie but it would have been nice to have one about winter that wasn't about the Iceman! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The last time I saw this movie, I was about four or five months shy of my eighteenth birthday. This was before I learned about the internet and computers, so I would see this movie almost every time my mom drove me to school. We would spend the majority of the drive in front of a VHS tape. I would get up in the morning and watch the movie with my mom as she would get me ready for school. She would watch the entire movie, not fast-forwarding to anything, but just sit in the car and read the entire script until she knew everything she needed to know about the movie.  When I saw it in 2001, it was a lot different from the movie I saw in '98.  My mom's eyes seemed to literally boil with tears of joy at the end of the movie, as she ran home to get more food.  She even brought me a toy dog that she made.      This movie has aged extremely well and even though I've since left home, I still watch it almost daily.  If you have kids, you should definitely give it a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen this movie a handful of times so far. I've seen it in a theater, on VHS, and now digitally. It's a wonderful movie, about a young boy (Derek Jacobi), who is given a rare toy that transforms him into an extremely rare species of flying insect: a flying dragon. They take it back to the local mall to try to collect more, but they run afoul of a giant spider, who's intent on eating the dragon. There are many classic creatures in the film: a monster truck, flying rats, and a dragon. If you're a fan of Sci-Fi, a family movie, and really have no idea what to expect in a Disney movie, then I'd strongly suggest you give this one a try. This is a great movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only thing that I really dislike about this movie is that all the things in this film happen in one evening (and only at the end of the film).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What more could you ask for?   In my opinion, this is one of the finest horror movies ever made, the plot is intriguing, the acting is top notch, and the music is absolutely incredible (especially the organ music.)   If you are a lover of classic horror and have ever thought about seeing a remake of a classic movie, then this is the movie for you.   There are a total of 14 monsters, and all of them are memorable, especially those that don't have names!   I would like to thank the director for such a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the summer of 1969 a young poet, Paul Bley, comes to a small town in Maine, to work with a local poetess. She takes him to a house at the top of a hill, where there are a couple of cows, a small house on a hill and, hanging in the rafters above the house, a painting of a woman. He comes here, and she talks about her own life, about her family, her father, and so on. The whole thing ends badly, after she sees Paul and his new girlfriend (who has become the girlfriend of a farm boy who is obsessed with her) at a bar and then hears that she's going to move, and moves with her father (who is away at work) and her friend and their new boyfriend. Her father is an abusive and drunken fool, she has a violent sexual relationship with Paul (I think that she likes him and can see in him the "my-way-or-the-highway" kind of man) and their friend. There is a strong ending: the woman becomes pregnant, the boy is in love with her, she's pregnant (she goes to the doctors in town) and the baby's father dies (which, I guess, is the beginning of the end).
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It is hard not to be seduced, however, by the images and music at work. The film is made up of three interlinked stories - of a man who has sex on the beach in a strange way, an alien, a woman and a scientist who are all in love with each other. All of these stories are told by the different characters in the film. In most of them the men have been seduced by women, and all of these people seem to know each other - but at the same time they don't. This is made really interesting by the fact that the director uses three camera shots and an omniscient voice-over for each story. It is like watching a live show - at the beginning and the end, where the different people have sex on a beach. At this point there are many different people gathered in the movie, and they all know one another so well they can all talk to one another. It becomes pretty difficult to concentrate on the different parts of the movie in the first part, because it all seems to be happening at the moment you're watching it. There are many things happening - a girl with a dog, another girl wearing a skirt, and a couple having sex on top of a car. The sex with the dog is especially interesting.   This film is very good and has been well-received. It really is an entertaining movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is a classic, a movie about what life is really like when you live on the edge.

The song, "You Can Keep A Secret," by "The Black Eyed Peas," is a very good song, and the rest of the music is excellent, too.    This movie isn't so bad. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie made me laugh out loud.  I was watching this on HBO and I loved it so much. I also didn't mind the fact that it was the late 60's and that people were still using the TV sets as big screen televisions. I just didn't see myself being in that movie. This movie is one of the finest American films of all time.   I love that movie!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  An epic adventure! I have never been more impressed by a film! From the opening scene to the end of the movie, no scene is wasted and the action is fantastic! The film is set in a world where only the elite of the elite can be seen. It's about an old man that's seen his world burn down to the ground in the past, but still keeps to himself. When his daughter is kidnapped, he goes on a one man rampage that results in him going against every enemy and getting out alive! This film is really one that I can't stop thinking about and I cannot wait to watch the next one!

( I can't remember the exact title) A little boy who has the good fortune of being able to ride a motorcycle to school is a bit of a problem in the neighborhood. He is a trouble maker and he has a huge crush on a girl in class, who is the same age as his. The only problem is that she is not that nice. It is a great, simple and sweet movie and a lot of fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For a low-budget movie with no special effects, this movie was surprisingly effective, well-crafted, and really frightening. This movie doesn't really do anything new or special, but it does tell the story of a young woman who gets possessed and eventually goes insane. You should avoid this movie, because the final act is too long and tiresome to watch; but if you're looking for an intelligent, unsettling, and horrifying film about a woman who ends up in a mental institution or a haunted house, this one is worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first 5 minutes are a little weird, but then it gets interesting. We have the classic man, stuck in a woman's body! Well, he is stuck for the better part of 20 years in this little house (a shack actually) and what has happened is that he has had the wife of his whole life taken away from him. Now that is quite a surprise because he has never been the sort of man to leave his wife, but somehow she was so sick that he had to do the deed. Well, there are a lot of jokes about people leaving their wives because of illness, and the way it is played makes the scene feel very much like some kind of soap opera, with a cast of strange, often rather unpleasant characters. Not very funny, although it does have a good bit of humour at one point, but it is not funny enough. I have found that comedy doesn't really work in this kind of movie. It is a lot like the story of the guy who was put on the shelf at the supermarket where there are no-one to buy anything except bananas and limes. He can't take it any more and goes for a walk, but when he gets back he finds himself in a shop selling bananas and oranges. I am not sure what the real joke is here, because the first half is very much of a 'comedian' type of humour (see below for what comedy looks like). The second half is much more of a character study in which we find out how the husband has become a real pain in the neck. He has become completely estranged from his family, and we see how things have really gone a bit sour when his wife tells him that his daughter is coming home for a visit, and how this is really causing her a lot more pain than his not being able to go and see his daughter! The plot doesn't quite work at all, and there is really no development of character (or even of plot), but it does go into a bit of the kind of satire that you expect in this genre, as you will see below. There are two scenes that make me laugh out loud, and that is when the husband is telling his wife that she is a complete bitch and then when he starts to get angry at his daughter when she tells him he isn't going to see her. There is a scene of the wife's daughter coming back from school in a mini-skirt (and it is at this point that I became very interested
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is always a pleasure when you can spend a pleasant afternoon with someone.  In the course of this day we found our way back to the old apartment, which the two of us had not used for a year and a half.  I felt it was quite a nice place and it was full of a large variety of interesting objects, particularly those objects which the French call "jouets".  When we were leaving the apartment for the last time we looked in the window of the attic and saw a young woman, clad only in a long skirt, sitting on a chair facing the window.  Her head was turned down and her face was quite beautiful.  This is an interesting coincidence.  We had discussed the case with a friend of ours a year ago, and he told us of the case.  The house was apparently abandoned several years ago and the owner had been out of the country, so there had been nothing to find.  One day a friend went out to get the mail and the next morning saw a very strange-looking girl sitting in the hall.  She asked about her brother, and the friend went to ask the girl.  After giving a detailed account of the circumstances, he returned home and reported his story to his wife, who also saw the girl and her brother in the morning.  It was in fact an American girl, who claimed to have had a good time in Paris and had returned to America.  Since that time she had been living with her uncle in a small cottage in the forest on the outskirts of Paris.  During the evening my friend had asked her questions and she gave an interesting story.  A little while later the girl told us about her adventures and how she had fallen in love with a young American man and then moved into a house near the airport where she had developed a good friendship with the man.  Some days later the American man disappeared.  When the girl found out where she was, she got a good laugh at the idea that her friend's husband might have committed suicide and then returned home.  There was a note left for her by the man and a box of matches with a note saying: "I'm going to kill you, you dumb old thing."  After a few days the girl was arrested and questioned by the police.  They told her that her story was nonsense and that the police could find no evidence to support her claim.  So the girl fled from the house and went to America, where
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a pretty good movie. I watched it before a movie at the cinema, which I liked a lot.   The movie was about a young girl who has a friend and a young boy who was like family.  It's all about how all the family members got together and how they all got married.  I'm not really into fairy tales so I didn't really care about the girl, although I liked that they took her out of the ordinary and tried to make her a normal girl.  The best part was when they were all together and all the girls said how they wanted to live happily ever after.  Overall a good happy movie, but not my favorite, I wish more filmmakers would try to make a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie for the low price of the little you will get for it. The main problem is that the only thing that was really "good" was the fact that it had a movie star in the title and that the actor, Bruce Dern, didn't look like he was trying to.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember sitting in the theatre on opening night of this film back in 1977 when, in addition to the well-executed production, there were many other excellent features throughout. This film is a wonderful homage to the old westerns of the early 40's. Some of the actors are quite memorable. The story line is somewhat predictable, especially in the first half, but then you'll start to care for everyone in this great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts off with some strange and eerie sound effects. It sounds like something from a bad horror movie from the 70's.   However, it quickly changes to a really disturbing scene of people being electrocuted, and the body of the girl being found in a pool of blood.  For the first 10 minutes or so, this movie is pretty good.  The violence is fairly graphic and graphic enough that it may not be for everyone, but for someone who enjoys horror movies like this, it is quite good. For a film with about 1 hour and 30 minutes total, this is very well acted and acted well.  There are also some good little comedic moments, and it is worth watching the movie in 2 parts.  It is probably one of the best movies to come out of the 1980's, and I do have to say it was probably one my favorite movies of all time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For any fans of the classic "Star Trek" shows: this is a must see. There was a good deal of debate over which episode is the best episode; this episode certainly won the debate. We've had quite a lot of "space adventures" on "Starfleet" but this one will be the only one to make you say, "Oh, dear! You don't want to miss this episode. You have to see it. It's the best!" I've read in a lot  of places that the producers of "Enterprise" were planning to make more shows and this time with the much older "Battlestar Galactica"; there's no doubt in my mind that the "Galaxy" series would have to be the last. I hope we'll get some more "Galaxial" shows in the future. You will not find a show that is as well done as "The Galaxy". It is good to see a show like this being produced. I've always liked Trek and it would be nice to see more of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The reason that this movie is so good is its cast. The movie is very different in the casting of main characters in its 2 movies. First movie had John Travolta and Julia Roberts as the good looking lead, and they were the 2 characters of the movie. Second movie cast the good-looking lead as Peter Falk and made it more romantic, and of course there is the romantic-hate angle. They were both good, but the movie is more romantic with Peter Falk since he's the character of Peter Falk. That said, this movie still has the love triangle between Peter Falk, Mia Farrow, and Mia Farr: I do not know why I thought this movie was better than the 2 previous ones, but it was. I don't know why Mia Farky Farr was the bad girlfriend, but I am glad she was in this movie. It is very simple: Mia Farry is just a pretty face with a soft heart and a mouth that can't make it to a full mouth. The rest is pretty much the same. Mia Fardow and Peter Falk are good, as is Mia Farson, but they didn't really have a love triangle in the movie, although it should be noted that Mia Fariow and Mia Fellan didn't have to marry each other: they could have just had a simple affair. They both were better off. All of these characters are not the most complex, but are all very nice. Mia Falk's father is so unappealing that you would think he was the lovechild of one of the women in the film, who is just Mia Fower. It could be that this father has no parents but his mother has a lot of time to kill in this part of the film. The other characters were also interesting. Peter Falk is the only one who has a complicated, deep, and loving relationship with his mother. He has a father that is always away on business and a mother that is just kind of there. Mia is a great girlfriend and I like them both. The sex scenes, however, are not great. They are a little rough. This was a movie that was supposed to be "good" and "dramatic". Unfortunately, the sex scenes are just about sex, not drama.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the most underrated films I've seen. In the film, this film's main characters are all very likable. I have been a fan of this film ever since I saw it. This film is a love story, and it is really good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen a few of the movies the "Dancehall Murders" has been featured in but I have never seen a movie quite like this one. This movie is a must see for lovers of film noir who love the style and atmosphere of these films.   It is a shame that this was an unauthorized remake that didn't live up to the original. If you like noir and can get a rental of this at a theater then do yourself a favor and check it out! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those films where you have to really think hard about what you are watching. It is a classic movie from the 80s. It looks beautiful, sounds beautiful, and plays it out perfectly. The special effects work is flawless. This is a great movie and should be on the DVD.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you've seen the movie, you know that the movie is a very strange film: it is set in a time when the American Indians had conquered nearly the whole of North America. In the movie we hear a story about the time when a young American Indian warrior (played by Anthony Hopkins) is captured and taken to the French city of Rheims. The French are fascinated by the Indian warriors and take pity on their situation, so they offer them a chance to live in peace. Unfortunately, the Indians do not accept the offer, since the French have captured their chief and his sons and it looks like the French will be the rulers of North Americans for generations to come. The chief then decides to free his sons one by one. The second son to get away (played with a smile by Christopher Plummer) and the youngest, the son who has been captured the whole time, is captured on his way to Rheim's. The whole film is about this kid (played as a young child and as an adult) who is captured. But he manages to escape and manages to get to Rhem's, and then meets a pretty white girl (played in this movie by Frances McDormand) who takes him into her home. There, the boy makes many friends, but he also has a crush on this pretty girl, who has lived there her whole life. And so the film unfolds in a way that no one would be surprised to see. That's the basic story and there are many variations on it, and many explanations, that are explained to us by the film itself. A lot of the movie will be seen in French, some parts will be played in English and there is even a few parts that have been edited from the French version. But the basic ideas are the same and the whole movie is really a masterpiece of French cinema.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've heard so much bad about this film that I was a little skeptical about picking it up, but to my surprise I was surprised by how good it is.   The acting was outstanding from all three actors, with the three main characters being outstanding, especially the one with the funny accent, which was a great gag!   For a sci-fi film it wasn't too crazy with sci-no-no's, but the one that annoyed me was the one where the aliens tried to kill the Earth and use a big cannon, and for some reason they used one of those old-fashioned black and white shots.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was always interested in watching the early films of Buster Keaton. I remember seeing The Great Dictator when I was ten and later watching the original 1933 The Big Sleep when I finally got around to viewing the film in the late 1940s. For someone who is no fan of Keaton's works and finds the film to be nothing special in the way of visual artistry, the films are very well made and have a timeless quality to them. There is a beautiful woman and we follow her as she goes to sleep each night and each morning when she wakes up she sees the same thing, a sleeping house on fire. In a way this seems to be like a dream or a nightmare which she can't wake from. This is not all that unusual, and in fact there are countless films of the period in which a house or a building is seen to be on fire and there is no one in it.   The opening scene is a bit slow-paced but the action picks up nicely as Keaton goes to work in the early morning and we soon see him get into action, working on the set while getting ready to film the day. The fireman who comes to tend to the building in the morning has a similar story as the first house: He sees the house on a fire and goes to investigate. The problem is that the house is on fire in the same place. He does manage to catch the fireman in the act and tells him he can't put it out. "Well then," we can hear the fire man say, "put it out yourself."   When the firemen come to the second house the same things happen: The woman sees it on fire, but no one is in it and the fire is put out by the fire-fighters themselves.  The second house, which has a fireman and a woman on it, is also on fire which makes no difference because we get to see the fire on fire from every side as the fire department comes and goes.  So how does this all relate to Keaton himself. It seems to me that Keaton was a very good actor who also had the talent of making something out of nothing with his characters and in the case of "The Big Sleep" was able to turn a small house on the side of a hill into a large fire that is raging outside.  It is not a good film and it is a little slow paced but it is certainly well worth watching.  I would suggest

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good old-fashioned Western starring the legendary Western actor Clint Eastwood, a man of action, one who would not stop until he had a good story, and a good screenplay by Frank Tashlin.    It is an interesting story with a bit too many western clichés but, at least it looks good on the big screen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a big fan of the 80's cartoon Batman with Bruce Lee and Tim Curry. I am actually kind of surprised this movie has not more been made since it is a pretty great movie. The acting is great, the storyline is great. The only reason I do not give this movie an even higher rating is the constant use of the "shark tank" theme. You should know by now that I have little to no respect for anything involving sharks. I have also seen the cartoon and this movie does not really make me want to watch it any more than if it had been a movie of the 70's. I will say it is good for a laugh at the movies and it will certainly keep my interest.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most famous horror movie of all time, The Omen is a pretty good example of an interesting concept.  It features a group of high school kids who get trapped in a lake while on a field trip.    The kids have some odd powers.    One girl can read the minds of people (she can do it from across the lake), another girl is able to talk to animals and a boy can turn into a monster at will.  The movie really doesn't go far from the original concept.     It has some pretty good effects and, like the original, it's a pretty scary movie.  This was the last film in the series before director and writer John Carpenter got really sick.  John died after making the movie, but the story's been retold many times and the movie is a favorite of many fans.  It's probably the most famous movie about a boy who turns into a murderous monster, but it should definitely be seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm giving this movie 4 out of 5 stars!   The story isn't great, but the movie is.   This is a great story about a guy who is really into the outdoors.  And really hates going to church.  It starts out with this guy going in a lot with his buddies. They have the best time. They laugh, they sing, and they have the most awesome time.  Then a guy comes along and he just doesn't want to have the fun.  He's a preacher and he seems to be really against having fun. But the guy is just too nice and all he wants to do is go camping and watch the sunset.  That's why he isn't camping with the rest of them.  When he tries to go camping, the preacher's daughter gets mad at him and says that he shouldn't be there, and he should just go back to the church.   The guy thinks she's insane, and tries to talk her out of it. But then another guy comes into the room. He is a pretty cool guy, and kind of likes the idea of camping.  So the guy comes back with a new plan. He wants to invite the preacher and his girls to camp with the guys.  The girls think it's a crazy idea, and the preacher doesn't really get it.  But they can't get past the pastor's daughter.  She's so old that she doesn't know who these guys are.  I like the part when the guy and the guy's guy get into a fight over whether or not there is no God and whether or "we" have all the answers.  This movie is great, and I can't wait to see it again!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first watched this documentary in 2010 and I loved it. The story was fantastic. It was an excellent example of how one man's passion can bring about change. I also liked the fact that this film didn't take itself too seriously. It made a good case for the American people to be wary of government conspiracies. There's a lot of good information in here, so I will post a review that is hopefully a little more optimistic.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When an evil, power-hungry and powerful man wants to become the king of the world, a woman with a bad secret decides to become his secretary. She begins working for him in a luxurious mansion in the mountains, when she meets a beautiful young man, who she likes. But she is never allowed to look at him, or talk to him, because she's a secretary - but this will change when she runs out of money and is in debt to her boss. So, she asks a magician for help. Unfortunately he doesn't have anything to do with the plot at all. He gives a magician a magic book which can create anything. The magician then does everything with this book, and it works, so that the magician gets rich, and the lady's poor. However, the girl has a secret and it starts to get out. She's a magician, and she's also very hot, which leads to lots of sexual excitement. The story is really silly, which makes it enjoyable for a laugh. It's also kind of interesting to see a very sexual, evil woman, who is really a kind of sexy goddess, with lots of sexy spells. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of my favorite movies of all time. It is probably one of the greatest superhero movies ever made. It takes two of my favourite genre's and turns them on their head. The story of a poor black boy in a big city trying to make a name in the world with his friends was a great one, but the characters themselves are amazing. They are both realistic and relatable and their relationships with one another are so true to life. They were the closest thing I had to a family growing up. It was such an amazing experience and I always felt the film was directed by the best director of all times, George Miller. If you haven't seen this movie, make sure you have. This movie has it all! I always tell anyone who asks me about my favorite movie, to do it before seeing Batman and Robin, it's that good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great sci-fi flick that is a real eye opener.  I loved watching this movie and it is definitely worth a watch.  It is a good old-fashioned thriller about a ship captain and his ship (which appears to be the same ship) that sets out to find a new land, to the east.  This movie is very much a work of science fiction and it shows it.  The characters are all real, and the plot moves along at a real, believable pace.  Also, the movie is extremely well shot, so you know what you're getting into.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is so bad, even if the director and stars aren't to be found, everyone involved is. The story is just bad, from the very beginning, a woman has been kidnapped by a demon. A little girl watches and is told a different story. Then the demon goes to a woman's house and kills all the family members (including the little girl). Then, he shows himself in a burning building (as if he just woke up) and demands that the woman come with him. She doesn't. A few minutes later, she comes back to her house, finds a demon there, runs, screams, hides behind a couch, and then runs out of the house with the little kid in a wagon. At this point, they decide to go to a hotel where the movie was being filmed in the morning. They meet the director. They go into the hotel where they meet the film crew. They talk to them. They get angry with them, scream at them, beat them up, do whatever they want. Eventually, they leave the hotel, get a cab to the theater and watch the movie. When they sit down to eat in a restaurant near the theater, a group of guys with masks and hoods come up behind them. The gang, like the demons, are hungry. The movie ends with one of the guys going into the theater through a back entrance. Then, the movie starts up with another man coming through the same doorway. They shoot each other. The director leaves the movie to go home. The actors sit around, drinking, eating ice cream, and thinking that it's all a good time. After a few drinks they go to their cars and leave. The next night they are at a movie theater, and the gang show up at the wrong theater. They start trying to get in the theater the old-fashioned way, they break down the front door. One of the actors gets killed trying to stop them. When the director gets home, he thinks everything is over. But not before he's heard the girl screaming for two hours. There are some more deaths after this, including the little actor's brother. The film is so awful, that one might say that if they'd gotten away with all their violence, there wouldn't be much left. But no, the actors don't think so. They continue their little act of destruction. And then, for a brief moment, it looks like something might change. One man comes out of a room.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is truly a classic, and if you haven't seen it yet it's worth your time. In fact if you've seen a movie with a great script, great acting, and a terrific script to boot it's this one.       I really think there's a lot of great stuff to be found in the film, if you have a few minutes to spare you should definitely watch it!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw the new version of the M. Night Shyamalan film "Unbreakable", which is another movie where Shyamaland is portrayed as a place where bad things happen every now and again. That being said, this movie, while being visually breathtaking, had very few moments where we could even remotely be happy about everything that was going on. The first half of the movie took place in a small town, where a young couple (Jennifer Connelly and Patrick Wilson) moves to after getting out of prison. Jennifer is the only daughter of the owner of a grocery store. Patrick is a local celebrity, who is an entertainer and a boxer. While there, Patrick is getting ready to face a challenge from the local champion (played by Will Smith) who is known as a boxer who can never be beaten. The challenge has been set up by a local boxer named Mr. Broussard, who will make Patrick fight for the title, which he is not very confident about. It is only when he discovers that Jennifer (who has a good chance of beating Mr. M, Brousard) is in town that Patrick is given an opportunity to face him. After a few rounds, a little girl named Lucy (played brilliantly by Jamie Lee Curtis) comes to Jennifer's rescue, and together they defeat Mr.Broussards and take the title for themselves. However, during the ceremony they discover that Jennifer is pregnant, which leads to a series of misadventures, one of which includes a kidnapping and a murder. While it is clear that this movie is very much centered on the lives of Jennifer and Patrick (and the couple's life in general) we can't help but feel a little cheated of any emotional growth from these characters. Sure there is a lot of tension between the characters, and they make it very clear who is the bigger person, but it seems like they are acting out their roles, and the events do not change their dynamic. What makes it worse is that the film doesn't really explore how much of a strain this would be for a pregnant woman, and that isn't really addressed at all. The characters have very little to do in the film, save for the occasional moment where they take a shower. Jennifer (the only person who doesn't give birth) comes in to see a doctor to be told that she is going to have a child, but she is told that it's not likely that she will live past her first birthday

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most wonderful place on earth!   My husband and I had been to the mountains recently and made a great day of it.   We had a lovely lunch at the restaurant and we had a wonderful view of the mountains.  On our walk back to our hotel, we passed a family sitting out in the sun.  It was very hot and it was an unusual time to be out in this hot weather because of it being hot and humid all the way around.  One of the children was having trouble walking.  The mother asked the child "what is the difference between us and the other kids?   And the child responded "The difference is we're smarter."  It seems I have become quite a smarty-pants and I can't get enough of these kids!  After lunch we drove over to one of the great rock formations in the area and we climbed up on the rock formation and then we climbed down on the other side.  At one point we were in the little cabin that the kid had told his parents were on a volcano.  They seemed quite interested in us and I believe were actually hoping we would go to this volcano.    In the afternoon we went over to a small waterfall with a little waterfall.  When we got there we could see the children all climbing the rocks and having fun.  My kids were much more interested in the falling rocks than the little children were.  Once we got all of our gear out of the car we found a little creek that was pretty close to the waterfall.   The little children started playing and the little girl jumped off of one rock and tried to swim the other way down and then she fell into the creek.   A group of two little girls ran to help the little boy.  I looked around and could see there were quite a few rocks all over the place and I was worried about my kids.  Then all of a sudden the little girls saw a huge boulder that was only about half the width of their little fingers and it landed right in front of them.    I have a hard time believing that there is such a thing as a good, big boulder.  There it was all for a good day's fun!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The idea of a small town that has an old lady with a big house and some crazy old dudes that live in the house, is an interesting concept, but the execution wasn't all that great. The idea was good, especially the ending that got the audience thinking, and had a lot of twists. The acting, though, isn't all so great, as it was done in an old-fashioned way and is pretty much non-existent from the time you leave the first scene. Also, the special effects were pretty pathetic, especially when they were used to show the old lady and her mansion and when they weren't. That being said, the story had some interesting elements, but they weren�t all utilized, which is why it wasn't very good. I would recommend this to anybody who likes a good old-time western story and a good bit of paranormal.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw the trailer for this movie, it looked like a lot of fun, although I had some trouble picturing what the hell it was about. Well, apparently the same is true of a couple of kids at school. Their father has become a "pariah" in society. Because of his eccentricities and lack of respect for others, he is shunned, and he's also known to be rather violent. The only thing that keeps him around is the kid's mother, who is also a delinquent. It's up to the three kids to try and make things alright.   While the kids don't exactly have a lot in common, I thought they did a great job in keeping the comedy at a steady pace. The acting was great and there was a little bit of dark comedy thrown in there, as well.  As for the plot, I was impressed by how the movie kept things consistent through the entire movie.  The action is actually well choreographed, the characters look and act realistically, and the jokes are all in one-liners.  This movie is not quite as good as I was hoping it would be, but it's still a very entertaining comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "Saving Private Ryan" saga is a fine, if rather predictable, story of two men who take on a military organization on one of the most bloody battlefields of World War II. It was directed by Stanley Kubrick and had its actors who were all highly praised: John Wayne and Gary Cooper, for example, are two of the finest American actors and are excellent in the roles they are given. There are not many things more violent on film than "The Battle of the Bulge," and this is certainly one of them. It is difficult to explain exactly what this movie is about, but it is certainly a film with a very unique point of view and a very powerful image. This is not a film for the faint of heart, and it certainly does not have the appeal of something like the German-American war film "The Great Escape." This movie has the violence and the sheer shock and awe of a good action film, but at the same time is a rather gentle film about the dangers of the world at war. It has a strong sense of style as well as a solid sense of the dramatic possibilities of film and is very powerful as a dramatic piece.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I saw A Clockwork Orange a few years back, I laughed out loud every time, and laughed hard, every time. The movie is dark and disturbing and utterly hilarious. A young punk, played by Anthony Newley, attempts to escape from the boredom of his job by stealing a van with a couple of doped up thugs and taking it out on the local women. Soon enough, they have turned into violent maniacs who kill women for the fun of it (as well as the sake of stealing a truck). The van is so huge that they have to take it to a farm to do a "job" (which of course, is to rob a bank). It's up to Newley and the two thugs to escape the farm and head back to their hideout. The "job," I think, is simply stealing a box that is being carried by a very old man (who in reality is in his grave) which is filled with some drugs (a very bad idea) and the film is simply hilarious. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good laugh and/or the sight of two people getting hurt. This is not the best movie ever made, but it is probably the best looking one. A Clockwork orange was made in 1969, just a few months before the movie came out and it is definitely up there with the other great sci-fi movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the end, I would say that we all need to be more like our fathers. If the world was divided into three groups, one of them being "dads", I think that the whole of humanity would be a lot happier if all of the dads of the world were to come together and take a long walk around the block. (Or a good night's sleep). The reason why this is not a movie about being "bought" is because if the dad has something to say about it, then it just becomes the whole movie about that. All the drama, drama and drama... All the acting... All of it is done to make the father's day more spectacular. Which is really a shame, because I had a great time watching it, because at least the dad's day does not end with an embarrassing day at the office. I do not know if I would recommend this movie to anyone, but if you are looking for a comedy to watch on a late night, then look no further.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I see it:  It's a little strange that the sequel to The Princess Bride   was a remake of a film released in 1984, right?   There's no way that the film was so cheap that it could have been made and released in 1983, and yet it somehow got made!   I mean, the entire soundtrack is a cover version, right through to the end, except for one track which isn't a cover at all, but an original song (the one about the horse that wants the girl).   So, in case you're wondering whether it was good or bad, it's a pretty good film.   The main plot is really interesting, if not completely original.  In addition, the film is filled with great laughs, some nice acting (and that's the point), a really good soundtrack (it might be my favourite soundtrack) and the plot is a good excuse for a silly fantasy.  And it's totally enjoyable (I had to laugh out loud to make a few remarks about how stupid the plot of the film turns out to be!).   And that's about it.

It is great to see the original cast all together again and we get to see a story that is pretty much how it is supposed to be.   This is one good movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is a film which should be seen by all who have been fans of Sergio Leone. It is certainly not an easy film to get to the end. There are some truly horrible things happening in the film which are not exactly presented as you may expect. Also, there is a lot of dialogue in the movie which is both a joy to watch and a major problem. It's one of those classic spaghetti westerns which is an essential film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was one of those movies where the actors are really good.   There was also a lot of stuff to do, like going out for breakfast, going to the movie theater to see a new movie, and of course watching this movie.  It took me a long time to see it.  My brother and I sat in the theater for about 30 mins. and it took about 10 more mins. for the movie to begin.  After the movie, they put up a poster of all the actors on the wall, so I could see them.  Of the actors. I remember the name.  This one is one of my favorites, and I'm really glad I saw it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a classic, and one of those films where the film is both a classic and an instant classic.   The story, set in a small Texas town during the height of the Depression, is simple. In 1931, a group of men (including the film's leading man, Robert Mitchum) set out to steal a valuable painting from a wealthy businessman named Frank D'Amico. They are successful, but at the cost of their lives. Frank is a sympathetic figure in the film, at least until his brother is murdered. Then Frank and the other thieves try to escape. They end up stranded in a ravine. In the ravine is an old woman named Helen, who lives alone. Her husband died. She has an old dog (who has been adopted by Frank) and, well, a lot of other dogs, most of which just want to get out. That's what she wants, too, in the end. So she lets the dog out. Frank finds her and she takes him for a ride. It doesn't go very well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very funny movie with a funny man who doesn't sound that great, but then again, he has a funny story about a beautiful woman who can't tell the difference between reality and fiction, but who has the "mighty arm" of a cowboy. If that wasn't enough, a talking "zombie" gets a few lines.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie with a few friends and it was fantastic!  My favorite part was the little girl in the car who got so scared by a little redhead girl in red that she jumped out and ran away as fast as she could.  That was a pretty good scene.    I hope this movie gets more theatrical release so we can see the whole movie, and maybe another little girl who doesn't seem to have a lot of good traits is in the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of the 1960's TV series and the movie,  "The Prisoner" is in the same vein.   From the very first shot of this movie you are transported to a bleak but beautiful landscape.  The opening narration gives us a small description of this little isolated place:  This remote island is known as 'The Prison'.  Inhabitants here are very quiet and orderly.  There are no buildings of any kind.  These are the only places on this isolated island.  For this lonely island the only means of communication is radio.  Radio has not been available on the island for a long time.  Now, in its dying days, the people of The Prison are using a little electronic device to communicate.  As in other of the shows of the 60's there are a number of characters.  Most of them are very likeable.  A man is a school teacher who must keep a school of his own for a group of young children.  However, the school is threatened with a fire.  Luckily, the fire is put out by the little boy who is teaching there.  In another corner of the island the children are being raised to be people in society.     What has this world come to?   It would appear that The Prison has become a kind of prison.  It is populated by a number one fan of TV:  Dr. John A. Mankiewicz.  This man has a rather strange obsession.  What is the purpose of television?  It seems to be more of an entertainment device.  Who needs a prison and a classroom to study?  However it is the only escape for many of the people who live here.  Perhaps the most compelling character in the film is the doctor who likes to visit each of the prison inmates during their periods of rest.  He is fascinated by each one of them.  Sometimes it is difficult to tell whether he really does care for them or just loves them.   It has been a long while since I have seen a movie that made me question the morals of the person watching it.  If anyone knows what is going on there is somebody to talk to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If your gonna talk about the movies...this is your movie. I'll be honest, I did not expect much from it, but I enjoyed the ride. I thought it was a very enjoyable ride. There are a lot of people that think the movie is "bad", and they are totally right. This movie has not much going for it. The acting is pretty bad, there is a lot to complain about. The characters, well, they all try to do something. All the other movies I have seen had a good plot, but this was a long, slow ride. And it had a LOT of shots which I thought looked silly (like the car being knocked over by the wind). If you are looking for a good laugh, well this movie has it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie, at least according to my copy, is based on a novel by Robert Aickman, which I have never heard of. It seems to be a rather simple tale. The young Robert's father is a doctor and the young Robert is to marry the daughter of a wealthy Jewish family. They are going to have a lavish wedding with a large reception which includes many of the prominent members of the family. All of a sudden, it all changes as Robert is accused of a brutal and vicious murder. At first, Robert tries to keep his story to himself so that he can at least protect his innocent bride from all the ridicule, hatred and anger directed at her. But then, there is a knock on the door. The man who enters claims to be Robert's brother. He claims that Robert has done something awful and he must be hanged. Robert does not want his father to murder him because he does not like his father.   There are no surprises in this film. The acting is mostly good, although in one scene the actor who plays Robert's uncle is played with a bad voice and a bad attitude. But most of the characters are very well done. There were a few scenes which really seemed to be trying to get some kind of revenge. But after a time, I felt they had gotten to the point where they did not want any more than that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To say the film is a good one is an understatement.  It is, in many ways, a movie about one of the last great westerns that America ever made.  At the time, it was one of many films that Americans loved that starred John Wayne (the star).  For some reason it made me a little sad.  The last one we saw before it was about a guy from Texas who goes to Montana and joins the Sioux.  That's it.  This film, however, is not about those things.  Instead it is about the struggle between those who were always at the top (the western) and those who always at least were at the bottom (the Sioux).  The Sioux were always in the bad place.  They were always fighting to keep a sacred thing and it just got in the way of everything.   This was not a bad movie.  No, it is not great.  Yes, it has a lot of good acting.  Sure, it might not have the quality of the earlier ones, but that isn't a bad thing.  For those who like the Western, I hope they continue to see more and make more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a sucker for science fiction movies. I've always liked Star Trek, but the recent new movies seem to have a lot of the things that I love - the humor, the mystery, the good science, and the big robots - while still keeping them very different.   The movie is set in the future, and I don't know what a time machine would do to make a person "feel" like they are twenty-five. But it seems to be working.  This is my first time to see a time-travel movie.  It might not be the most original idea in the world, but it works really well in the film, and looks great. It is certainly an entertaining movie to watch - especially as the movie takes a lot for granted. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not often that a movie is released that has both a positive and negative point-of-view, both of which are valid and should be celebrated by movie fans everywhere.   The film, however, would not have made a better movie without the presence of Jennifer Lopez and a beautiful performance from Michelle Pfeiffer.  In addition to all that, there is so much more going on here than meets the eye; the story itself is about a couple trying to make it into the Big Time in Hollywood.  While the film may be a little on the heavy side at times, this is really just about two struggling actors and a bunch of young actors trying to find their way in the movie industry.  It is a story about the "Golden Age of Hollywood", which was really just that--a time when young actors had the chance to make money off of their acting talents but didn't make many attempts to succeed beyond the initial audition stage.  This, however was not to last, because as the generations passed, the entertainment business began to change into a business of making money, and the more money that was made the more star-studded the movie business became.  The young actors now were asked to act as though they were millionaires, which they did not want to be, so they did what they could and worked hard.  However, the film, while a good film, is not a very good movie at all.  There are plenty of instances where the film simply makes a fool of itself.  But what it is good at is showing the two actors trying hard to make things happen and the movie has a very strong message that should resonate with all movie fans; you can make it in Hollywood if you want to, but don't expect too much success if you don't have great acting talent.  I have to give it a 7.3 out of 10, although it had some interesting parts: 1. A good story told from the point of view of two actors who are just trying to survive in a movie world where money means everything. 2. A great performance from the great Michelle PFEiffer, who has the kind of acting talents that have yet to be matched. 3. A powerful message about how hard working people with great acting talents can achieve success and success is a good thing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It may be a little odd that the movie starts with a very, very long (more than 70 minutes) intro about some people watching a movie at a bar, and some of them having some kind of sexual experience in there. And that was the beginning of the movie. Well, it really went nowhere.    The story itself is about four people who have a strange dream; they sleep together and, before they know it, they find themselves in a strange room where they have to find their way out and go back to sleep. Then, the weird thing happens: they find out that the room is filled with some kind Of weird monster that will not leave them alone. This is all in the beginning; it is a little bit confusing. The movie is about some other strange things: there is a girl who looks like a boy, but can talk, and her boyfriend is a weird guy who loves to wear dresses. It is all a mess of an idea, especially when you realize that the four guys are not actually alone for more than a minute in the room.  There are some really strange images that are very easy to dismiss as a bad dream, and I did so after the first two minutes. But then I realized that there is another weird thing going on here: there are strange shadows of people walking around in the dark.  The whole movie was really annoying, and that is not a bad thing. But the movie itself was very odd, and there was no way to understand what is going on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a former lover of the early James Bond movies, I was disappointed to see the movie never caught up to the books. This film was more akin to the later movies of this series, and not as good.  My daughter was excited and I was pleased at my wife's reaction.  The only redeeming aspect of this film is the amazing music. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was looking for a movie that was just as funny as I was. I wasn't disappointed. It's very funny. A lot of laughs, and a lot of swearing. It is very much like a real "comedy" movie. That is what it is. A movie that is based on a true story about an airplane accident. I was a big fan of the movies "Groundhog Day" and "Blazing Saddles". This movie is just as good as those two films.   The story is pretty easy to follow. The hero wakes up in the same place each morning, finds a cat on his head, finds himself in a movie theater, etc. The whole time he has to act like the movie is really happening. It isn't, of course, but it is pretty close. The bad guy is the only annoying person I've ever seen in a comedy movie. And he is played by a very good actor. I didn't really find out who this bad guy was until later on in the film, because it takes forever for the hero to figure out who the bad guy really is. This movie never forgets what it's about. It knows what it should be about and it just stays with it until the very end. I had some trouble following it, though, since I am terrible at following a movie. I thought I understood the plot at the beginning, but everything is a bit confusing. I only wish I didn´t have to watch it over and over again. The acting is OK (I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone without a sense of humor), but I find it lacking. At least, in my opinion, it lacks a lot. I also think it lacks some laughs. I found myself laughing at the end of the movie, but that is it. The last 15 minutes is all just the same one-liners repeated over and again. I could say the same thing about the rest of the film.   I can't recommend it to anyone. I mean it's funny, but at the same time, I didn`t find it funny. It just seemed like a movie I had to watch, not that I was going to enjoy watching it. I don't mean to sound like I am bashing the movie. This is a very funny movie, very entertaining, and very funny, which is a rare combination. If the movie had some funny parts it would have made me laugh a few times, but instead we get

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have had quite a few bad experiences with this movie. It is basically another black comedy. Well, the movie has the best parts, the acting is decent, but the humor is bad. The comedy is very much a slapstick movie, and the bad parts are just as much slapstick comedy as the good parts. I like this movie quite a bit, it is not a bad comedy by any means.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought this was an interesting movie for my daughter.   The movie was based on the true story of a girl named Anna.  Anna was a very young girl when her parents were killed by a mad man.  Since then she has had a life changing experience.  Her new "father" who is also a man with a mad streak and who has a sadistic sense of humor.  Their new home is a rundown cabin on the outskirts of an eerie forest.  The family is on the run from an evil creature that is looking to get at them.  I found it interesting how Anna and her family used their own weapons to fend off the creature.  There were some parts that I found a little hard to swallow.  My main problem was how the young girl's mental state was portrayed.  Sometimes Anna did not appear in her right mind, and I found that a little disturbing.  Also the acting was poor, especially the girl who was always with the man with the sadistic streak, he was a pain.  Overall this was a pretty fun movie that will entertain most children. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a little skeptical of this one at first. I don't like the sound of the title "Evan Almighty" at all, but I gave it a chance and it ended up being a pretty cool little movie. A young man who can barely make it as a mechanic (because he lives in a house with only a mattress on the floor!) and a little girl who is a bit of a brat but an angel nonetheless have to drive a train through the Canadian Rockies and to the top of Mount Everest to retrieve a sacred stone. You get a little glimpse of the mountains and the glacier and Mount St. Helens before the story kicks into gear and you're given a taste of the adventure and the beauty. Evan Almighty doesn't shy away from gore, there's a pretty good amount of blood and gore to be had and you have to see it for yourself. The music is nice and fits the mood of the movie and the sound effects are spot on as well. The acting is top notch too and you get the feeling that the two leads (the young boy and the little girl) are quite close and really like each other and that Evan Almighty is a picture of a perfectly normal child trying to be a grown-up. Evan can't help but be a little childish at times but there's no way he's a freak of nature, he loves his mother and doesn't even know about all the nasty things the world has to offer. This is an interesting movie and I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good western and a bit about the mountains!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a fantastic picture that is not overly complex but is still very enjoyable in many different ways.  The plot of the film is excellent with a number of great moments.  It has an interesting cast including the two-timing brothers who have a long history of threesome action movies.  I found it interesting to see the older brother (Ray) not only in action films (one of his previous is a movie I watched last year) but also with two other actors; I wish I had seen more of them.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw the first two episodes. One was funny and the other was a tad predictable but I didn't mind it. They could have done with less time in there but I would not have minded them more. There is an air of mystery to the plot, the characters are all unique and there are good scenes in between. It doesn't have the same energy as Lost but it is a decent watch and has some good laughs as well.

The problem is that she has two cloned brothers. One is a normal sized green reptile, the other a normal large green reptilian. When the scientists find out she is trying to clone the reptilian they are not too happy about it.    One of the best sequels I have ever seen.

I watched it for the first time and I was a little bit surprised to learn that the film was a TV drama.  It was a good show and I am glad that it was on TV and not on film.    This film was made in 1963 when it was still a popular way to have a nice, easy time.  I remember it well for it was fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is not a good film, and most certainly not a movie that has any business being released. It is as if the producers decided that it was a good idea to go with a plot about an alien with the ability to talk to the dead and, after a brief sequence of this ability on one of the dead, the plot then proceeds to go on the hunt to discover why he can communicate with the dead. At first, the dead seem to know quite a lot about his past, and their stories about an ancient race of reptilian humanoids (which are apparently the ancestors of the humans of our day) and their encounter with a flying saucer seem to be nothing out of the ordinary for the times. There is very little reason to give this film any time at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first movie is excellent and very well shot. It doesn't even try to be subtle: just when you think it's going to be a generic horror movie (I don't think you can call it a horror film anymore, although the ending, which I won't spoil, is indeed a shock) the director goes off for an action scene and pulls of a brilliant one. It's well-written, has some cool kills, and a great score, which is perfect for such a low budget movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In one of the best examples of an action movie, a gangster (Robert DeNiro) is gunned down in the back of a car. His body is dumped out on the side of a highway and he's never seen again. Years later, when the local mob comes to avenge him, they find a body in a river. Now, the body is found not too far from where the gangsters last got their guns. The body is that of the gangster's son who has been missing for more than 20 years. Then the mother of the murdered son calls the police in a desperate plea for help. But the cops can't tell the difference between the body found in the river and the body of the missing son.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, the film had a fantastic title: it's a film about a kid who wants to be a doctor, who takes an extra-curricular course on making a monster out of a pig, who then gets possessed by a demon and tries to kill everyone that comes near him, and who is then killed by an ancient, evil witch (who is played by Meryl Streep ). The movie has some great monster-stomping action and a terrific, catchy theme song.   The story is a little bit on the thin side, and the ending of the movie leaves the audience with a lot of questions, but overall the film has many of the same elements that made the original Monster Squad so successful: it has lots of monster-mashing and gore, it's about a boy who wants a good career for himself, it has a strong female lead, and it's got a great theme song, and a really great ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a lot of good horror in this film from director Rob Minkoff. The first film in this series starts off strong and doesn't let up throughout the film. I really enjoyed the way the plot progressed and kept me intrigued in the end. There is no better way to introduce your audience to horror than with a great piece of art. This is the first piece of horror cinema I've seen in a while that I didn't feel was cheesy at all. I know I don't normally have much of a negative experience with this genre, but this is the kind of movie that I want to see over and over. I'm going to check out the Blu-ray when it comes out to see if I can find a copy somewhere.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story begins with an old man telling us a story about the man who saved his life by jumping out of a train on a rainy day. There are a few different versions of the story told by the old man as the camera pans across the train yard as he tells it. One version, and the one I like best, is that the man ran onto the tracks to take shelter when the train was suddenly derailed. The train was a big one and seemed to be heading north when he jumped out of the way and ran toward a nearby building. The old man ran toward the building to tell the man that he was alive and they could escape. The man came down the steps to the train platform and asked what was going on. The elderly man told him that it was the time of year and the rain was coming down in sheets. The poor old man told the man he had a place and would give him a ride. The young man left the train and began running toward the train again. The rain continued to pour and the young man started running and eventually found the old place and told the old guy he had been rescued from the train. The two men met and were reunited with family. The happy couple took in a film with the two men as the old old man reminisced about his youth.   This is a simple but very entertaining story told in an old fashion way and it is a wonderful piece of film. It will leave you smiling and remembering the good old days.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a good action movie with a nice twist and a great ending. The movie is about a guy who is in a very bad situation. He gets caught in an old abandoned building and finds a hidden door behind a trashcan. He goes into the door and meets another guy. The two guys get into a very fierce fight and in the end it is the guy who was hiding the hidden door. In this hidden door is a machine that sends electric shocks to your head every time you close your eyes. The guy who got the hidden button gets a shock that will give him horrible hallucinations all night and the guy with the button who can't get a shock is totally paralyzed from the neck down. This guy ends up in jail and is taken in by his ex-wife and his wife and daughter are staying with him. The ex-wives are having their dinner in the kitchen and are talking to their husbands while they are cooking. The wife has just left to go to her room and when she comes back she finds her husband in a strange room with no light and no bed. When she comes out she says to the husband that she just wants to go home but he doesn't know what to do. After going out some more, the husband goes upstairs and he tells his wife that the machine had a bad trip and has to be destroyed. The daughter tells her mother to get rid of the machine so she won't be scared anymore. In the process of smashing the machine, the father and daughter get into another fight, and when he gets in a second fight, the ex- wife goes back upstairs and tells her father that her husband's neck has been broken and she has to go back to where the fight is going to begin. So she goes back into the kitchen, gets a knife and goes to stab the husband. The husband starts to run up the stairs toward the machine when the daughter attacks him and she stabs his chest. The son finds his father in the bathroom with the wife and his ex, all of them holding guns. The sons are told to get out of the house and when they are all gone, the wife goes into her bedroom and puts her head on her mother's lap. Her mother tells her that the son has killed his dad and that he will be sorry for it. She says that he is going back and takes the phone away from her. She is going away from home and there will be no-one to care for her. The mother then
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you liked  The Wolf of Wall Street, then this will be right up your alley. Like the other big Hollywood movie with a star studded cast like this, it was an unqualified success.   What it is about?   A young bank manager who, like many bankers, comes from a poor background but has a bright future ahead of him. One day he takes over a failing bank that is about to go under, because the other banks who own the assets haven't been willing to lend any more money. The bank needs an injection of cash and is offering a 10% dividend. This is something unheard of at the time so the young banker takes a chance.  He sells a stake to a well known bank, and goes in to raise more money by selling new shares to investors. It works but it is a terrible move. The investors are worried about the bank, worried about him and so are the rest of the senior staff at the bank. He has got himself a great reputation because of the bank but the bank are very worried about that, and all is not right in the world of banking. The Wolf  is a very good film, I can only think that this was a huge success because a lot of people, myself included, were looking for something new to watch, and with the high expectations, that a big Hollywood studio set, it provided just that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Wages of Fear" is a true masterpiece of a Nazi film, and a chilling film about the horrors of the Third Reich, especially the gas chambers.  It was made before the Holocaust, but the scenes with the Jews made the Holocaust look like a child's play.  The film has an excellent cast, including Klaus Kinski as the evil SS officer Himmler, who seems to be enjoying this film so much that he watches it while walking through the countryside wearing a silly straw hat and carrying a parasol.    The story is well told, with excellent performances, and some great dialogue.  One has to give Kinski credit for the part he played in this film; it is a good role, and the actor's natural charm and ease with the script make us wish he had played another movie.  Even so, his character, which is not only a good comic role, but also has a tragic undertone in it, is a real delight to watch.  It is also a really funny film, especially in the scene when a Jewish family are ordered by Himmol to take their baby son down to the gas chamber to be killed.  We must also give credit to director Werner Herzog, who makes the film an effective horror film without getting too close to the subject of the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first film to show a non-tobacco smoker who has always had his pipes by the end of his second or third day. He is quite a character, and his journey is to learn how to be a good pipe smoker and not a bad one. He has been smoking a pipe for many years, but in a very unhealthy way. But when he gets a new pipe that is a good one he begins to smoke it properly. The rest of the movie does not waste much of its time on an ordinary tobacco smoker. It seems to be more about his journey from tobacco smoker to good pipe-smoker.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The second installment of the James Bond series, with all the trimmings. The 007 films tend to be a little heavy handed with action - it's just a little to much of the time for that genre. Even when Bond is actually trying to kick a bad guy's ass, it often ends up being a silly action-romp instead of a more traditional action movie. This movie gets most of the action done by the James Bonds from the previous two Bond movies. Of course, not everyone gets the role and not every Bond film has the same depth. This Bond movie is pretty weak and has no story. There are a few bits of humor (in the form of an old Bond song about a man in a bad disguise, and the "bad guys" with their swords being brought to life by a radio) and a bit of good old-fashioned "hero's journey" kind of stuff.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a word, good! Well, to be fair, this is a "real" horror movie - with a very original plot. Some great kills and creepy moments.   D.B. Woodside plays Jack Crawford who, along with his sister Alice (played by Lottie Hunt) are on a camping trip in the Appalachian mountains. This particular trip turns out to be more or less a death trap as Alice soon becomes a corpse, and the four of them end up trapped on a trail for a couple of days. While Alice seems to be the least of their worries - having been poisoned and then eaten by a werewolf, it turns out that the trail leads right to a mountain full of murderous monsters. They manage to make a pretty good meal out of their predicament, but at the same time they don't quite get the hang of things, resulting in a pretty gruesome scene:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen all the films on this site, but I have never been satisfied with any of them. I am not a big fan of action films. I really like the first one though.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very excited about this movie. If you read some of the reviews, you'll see that everyone I speak about is a fan of the book and this movie is one hell of an adaptation.   It's set in London and follows the adventures of a very nice looking man who takes to the road after he's diagnosed with terminal cancer.    I'm sure you know the plot by now, so I will just add in a few additional details to what's already been said about it.  In a very interesting twist, the terminally ill man (Paul Bettany) travels to London, where he meets a woman (Laura Linney) that he falls in love with.  However, this woman, along with her boyfriend (Cameron Diaz), have other ideas.  I've read a lot of the Harry Potter books and watched the movies and I must say that this one was one of my favorites.  It made me want to read all the books in the series.  The plot is very interesting, the cinematography by Peter Jackson is excellent, especially during the scene where Paul Bettany is on a train in London.  After a visit with his girlfriend, Paul is in a terrible state and so he finds himself back on the road.  He takes a job in a bar but soon finds that he is very much out of his element and in a position where the only thing he wants is to be dead.  And he is!   The movie is very well made and the actors are excellent.  There is a great deal of comedy in the film which I found very funny, especially Paul Bettanys line "Oh well, I guess I will have a few more days to live."   If you're a fan, you will enjoy this.  The review is for the DVD version of the movie: There is actually a very good version of this movie floating around on the internet.  At first, the movie was not made well enough to be good.  Then, the producers decided to make it better by adding a couple of extra scenes and even throwing in a couple more actors.  What happens in the extra scenes is that the movie ends a bit differently than the book.  When the movie opens, it seems like the terminale (Paul) is still going on as he drives to work.  This makes him look much younger than he really is.  But as he gets to work, he realizes that his work

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My first time visiting the New Zealand countryside and the stunning scenery of this place caught my attention. The scenery is all about stunningly stunning scenery. From the rolling hills in the background to the towering mountains and all the wild beauty of the NZ countryside is amazing. I can't even begin to tell you how beautiful this scenery is. I am currently back in Auckland where we have spent some time doing things we haven't done yet. So far we have eaten out at several restaurants and we still haven't managed to find a place to stay. I have found a few photos of the New Zeland countryside to look at but this time I am going to see it in all its stunning beauty!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a good little movie. The movie was quite good, and had some good effects. At one point I thought, it might as well be a movie about the real life adventures of the U.S.S Enterprise. However, this is quite different from that. The crew, despite a lack of weapons or any way to fight back against the enemy, were able to outsmart the enemy and destroy it with the help of a small "fart cannon". It was entertaining and I can imagine a lot of people watching this movie, especially for children. It will probably stay in the movie theaters for a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've never seen a movie quite like this; it is an unmitigated joy.   A very strange idea:    This is a film about a guy who goes to a lake in the summertime, but then one night (he doesn't say in what season) an old lady in the nearby cottage gets into his boat and swims off into the lake.  This, of course, is a metaphor for the story the hero (Owen Hatherley) has to tell, but the way it is set up is really rather wonderful.  As he tells it to his wife he is in a fog and doesn't really see anything; but when she tells him that she is going to swim out and see if there are any fish she says that that would be great if there were, but that she knows something that he has to do. So off he goes and when he finds the old lady swimming there is a big brown fish.  And when he goes up to grab it it lets go at him.  Now, the fact that he finds this is quite astonishing and he has a terrible fright, but at least he doesn't drown.  The fish is a good metaphor of what the man has to go through, but it is also a good allegory for human nature, and why people don't behave themselves.  There is no reason why they should, after all.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw a preview of this film on TV and I'm surprised it wasn't a blockbuster. I didn't care that there wasn't much action in this film. It took place in ancient Egypt in the year 2550 BC and was more of an introduction to ancient Egypt than an actual movie. The actors were all excellent. I enjoyed the characters of the Pharaohs and their relationship with each other and the gods. I wasn't able to find out much about this world or what made it famous. It certainly wasn't "The Bible." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is very simple and fast-paced, but still keeps a surprising amount of suspense. The first half is very slow, but at the end everything speeds up.   You need to watch this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be honest, I don't think a story or a movie can be made without the help of special effects. A few films use this technique in interesting ways, and the one in this film is quite unique: the entire movie takes place in a small room, illuminated by a single lamp, and a small number of people appear to be talking to each other. They talk in the same language - Arabic. The lights go out and the conversation stops, and another room appears, illuminated with a single long lamp. This room is very large, and includes a small square table in the middle, with a long, white lamp mounted on it, hanging on the wall at a distance. The movie opens with a brief scene of a number of persons sitting around a table with their heads bowed and their eyes closed; the room is quite dim. The conversation takes place over the phone; there is no sound and there is not the slightest trace of the lamp on the table. After a time the room begins to light up. The lamps are being switched on one after the other by an old man who is playing cards. A girl and a young man are playing a game of chess; both get up and move away, and then sit back down. The old man turns out to be the king of the kingdom. After watching them for a while the king rises from his chair and says "Good evening." He then stands up and begins to walk around the room. At a different point, the King goes into the table on which the chessmen are set up, and he picks a piece off the chessboard. The chessmen all take the piece off their chessboards and the camera begins to move from the king towards the other players at the table, and it shows the pieces being brought towards the king's hand, until finally it moves the king onto the chess table and the old man hands the pieces to the king. The king then picks another piece out of the pieces on the chess board and takes it. He then turns back to his own pieces and says, "Do you see that, do you understand what I say?", and they all say yes, of course, and walk away. As they sit around the table again, the old king walks up to them, sits next to them and says: "What's that?" They all say nothing and continue to eat the chess pieces. The new king then stands on the edge of the table and says to the others, "Come along, you guys
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm sorry to say that I don't think it is possible to have a good sci-fi film set in the 1970's. This is set in a near future where a bunch of hackers from San Francisco's "Hackerspaces" have come up with a system to send out a broadcast in the form of images on a massive light cube. The cubes are actually living beings that, like any real life beings, can be controlled, programmed, etc... The cube in the first film, played by Richard Lynch, is called "G'Vera" and it is controlled by a man named Dr. Z, who tells the kids that G'Vero, like most people, has a very primitive way of interacting with the world. Dr. G'Valar has invented a "mind link" which allows him to "upload" himself into a robot body. It is all very mysterious and futuristic. I'm not sure how it will play out in the end, because the movie is set around the end of the 1970s. It could work if it had an original, more interesting story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would describe the film as a love letter to film noir; a classic that would not look out of place in the era of the great Alfred Hitchcock.   The film is based on the story of a pair of lovers who are traveling through the city, when suddenly they notice an old gentleman who is sitting in the gutter.  The woman sees the man as a symbol of her lost love and begins to follow him.  But then he begins to stalk her as well and they both end up in a bad old town where a series of murders take place.  In this case, the man was played by the legendary Charles Boyer (who has been known to play the ghost of an old woman on the movie screen).   What makes this film so perfect is that there is not a single scene that doesn't make you feel as if you are in a movie noir.      As well, as is the case with a lot of classic movies, there are a variety of actors who play different characters in this film.  And it is only in this case that I could tell that this film is so well-known in Hollywood.  With beautiful cinematography, great acting, great music and the best of a classic genre (that is film noirs) all wrapped up in the perfect mix of mystery and suspense, This is one movie that I would watch time and time again!

I loved it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first true sequel to The Man Who Fell To Earth  I didn't see the first one when I was a kid, but I was reminded of it by the fact that, when The Man in The Moon came out, nobody else was doing a sequel to it.   I suppose this is how movies should work: if one really loves an old classic and wants to try to give it the second chance it deserves, there should be one more to be made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been doing this every year now for nearly a decade. I've made about 50 films over the last 15 years and it's a good time to have a good crowd. I really liked this movie and it had me in stitches. You'd be surprised how much I love watching old vaudeville skits. The movie is about a little girl that lives alone and she hates going to sleep. She has a lot of fun with some of the other kids in her neighborhood and one day she hears a noise outside. She goes out to investigate, and it turns out to be the police. The kid, of course, is very embarrassed, and she's afraid that she might get in trouble. One of the cops sees the little girl and tells her that she'll get in more trouble for doing nothing while her older sister is out there getting a ride to the police station for talking to some guys. The girl can't believe what she's seeing. She runs back in the house and tells the neighbors what happened. The next day she goes back out and notices that a few of the kids still don't go to sleep and all of the dogs are still barking, but there's no police officer anywhere in sight. She asks one of the others if there's a policeman outside, but he thinks that it's not a bad thing. He points out that there's plenty of other kids that can go out, and that's just fine. The little girl's really amazed. She thinks that there ought to be someone at least looking for her, but that's never going to happen, and besides that, she's really not in the mood to go out there for a ride. She wants to stay right here all the time. She doesn't like going outside and she doesn't want to go back to the house for a long time.  And I'm glad that that's what she said. She knows that her sister is on her way to the station. In fact, she knows that she's going to be out there in a couple of days, too, because the big guy who owns the place knows that his daughter is going to get in so much trouble, and he doesn't think it's good for his little girl to have anybody in her life who is going around going around getting in trouble all the while. But, in the meantime, the poor little girl has a good laugh at her own misfortune, and I really enjoyed it. I don't know

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has a lot of stuff going on. It takes place in the 1920's, so there's a fair amount of the old west in it. The acting was a tad thin, but they were good actors in a movie that is all about good acting. I had a great time watching the film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie follows two brothers, Billy (Dylan Baker) and John (Billy Bob Thornton), as they live a simple life in a small town during the depression years. This is a film about two boys who really do love to laugh and play, but they are not content with just that. They are also really sensitive.   The story focuses on their life during a period when the Depression is ravaging America and the world. A movie like this is a welcome break from the serious fare that is so prevalent these days.  This is not a comedy, it is serious.  Dylan Baker and Billy Bob Thornton are so perfect as brothers.  It is obvious from the beginning that the film is all about their family.  The two are always doing something together and the movie never lets up on that theme.  When the two aren't doing silly things together, they are busy planning the adventures to come.  There is never a dull moment in The Big Flop.  The humor in this movie is so funny and so easy to follow.  To a layman like me this may be an easy watch and I am not going to give the plot away, but for anyone who has grown up in a family, there are some really funny parts.  One funny scene is a scene where the twins were walking to a baseball game, but Billy Bob got cold feet, saying "There is no place for you here."  He then takes off his shirt and starts dancing around.  Another funny scene involves Billy Bob and his "uncle," John. When he comes down the stairs John says, "That is what they say you are, not a brother."  I'm sure a lot of people laugh every time they see this film.  A good time is had by all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is not a good one.  I was surprised to see that this was about an ex-CIA agent (Michael Caine) who takes a job at a bank in Moscow.  He is assigned to run a security room, and the bank he's put in contact with (Mikhail Baryshnikov) is extremely violent.  The movie does not give an opinion of these two, which I guess was expected.  When Michael Caine is introduced, we are made to look at the man as someone not to be trusted.  You can't put someone like Michael Caulin down, but he doesn't give a damn.  Caine's character may be very well written, but it lacks depth.  There is little to no humor in this movie; the violence is too intense, and some of the dialogue is terrible.  Some people might enjoy the "Russian Connection" movie, but I didn't.  For me, it was not worth my money. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A solid movie, a fun time.  It is about an alien who tries to take over earth and is forced into a series of events that lead to him being a real hero. He ends up taking a job as a janitor at the White House.  This movie is pretty much the definition of a "darn funny" film. The first half is a classic "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf" movie. Then he learns that the bad wolf is actually a janitors son so he's off to work with his son in a good old fashioned alien action adventure. The action is pretty good, it looks like a cross between the "Jaws" and the "Beverly Hills Cop" movies. It is fun at times but the pacing can be a little slow. The aliens end up taking over most of the land including most of Washington D.C. But they have a few problems, they are being controlled by a race of beings called the "Masters of the Universe" who believe that the earth was once a paradise.  There is a nice ending.  If you like aliens and funny action movies, this is a great one! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is about a very important figure from the history of the art of painting, a great genius. And this was not the first time. His name was Renoir, as you know, and he is the one who first painted portraits.   The idea that he invented painting is a little ridiculous. As an artist he was very inventive. He studied with many masters, but when you read all this about his artistic genius you think: a real genius.  The movie deals with the rise of an artist who is really not the same as a real one, and then the decline.  And it is not only Renoir, he is a very significant figure.  You will also find interesting about the relationship between Renoir and Louis, and their relationship with different European cultures. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the best movies I've ever seen, a modern classic, one of the most enjoyable and entertaining movies ever made, and a very sad film from the old school Hollywood that made a lot of movie lovers happy.  The premise of the movie is that the world was hit by a plague from a volcano, and everyone died in a few days after this "earthquake". The world was ruled by a cruel Queen named Queen Elizabeth. It was the best Queen Elizabeth ever.  She had the best looks, the best personality, and she always was in the best of moods.  As long as she was happy, her people did good things and it was easy for her to rule the country.   The one thing that really got Elizabeth upset was the death of one of her beloved slaves. After she found out that her slave was dying, she took him as a prisoner to one of their enemies, and then she killed the man and took his place.  It is hard to say what Elizabeth was thinking while she was doing this.  There are a couple of reasons that are suggested for Elizabeth's behavior, and all of them are pretty obvious. The first was that she knew she could be overthrown by her former lover, and therefore she was trying to find a way to make sure that didn't happen. This was the only reason that I could accept, at the end of the day. Elizabeth didn't want to take her lover to another planet with her and leave him there, but she also didn't like the idea of losing him. The second reason is the fact that she was a cruel queen and she wasn't particularly fond of people who didn't follow her rules. This is the reason why she took the slave to a world where he had no friends and where he was going to die in a week. This caused Elizabeth a lot more discomfort than it should have because she didn't really understand how to handle her people in such a manner.  The third reason is that Elizabeth knew she was going be overthrew and she also knew that she had to kill a man to take his place as the new Queen, so she decided to do this to help ensure that it didn't occur. But then she had the stupid idea of taking her lover back.  This was totally a stupid thing to do, but Elizabeth just didn't have much else to do.  One would think that a person of Elizabeth's caliber would make more sense than to do the

I found it fun to watch all the characters from a different perspective.  The acting is good with the exception of Sam Neill and Tom Baker.  This film is great for all ages.  To me it is like a "How to kick a man in the balls" movie.   This is a fun action-packed movie and a good one for old time fans.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a while there I thought that "American Beauty" was going to be the "American movie" to beat the "British film" to my old bedroom on the beach. It's funny to think now that it came out right after I had gotten married to a beautiful Brit, and that I got the chance to do all those things I thought I was born to do. (I mean, we had a lovely young daughter and a dog. The movie didn't last long. I think there was a fight in the restaurant over who could take out the trash first.) This film was my movie. It was very good movie, I had no idea the trouble it was in. One of the biggest issues was that there were too many actors in this movie, so all they did was talk to one another. There was so much of it, there was too much talk. They didn't do much of anything but talk. And talk. Talking, talking, talking. And I thought there had to be something they could do. But there wasn't. I liked most of them. (But don't tell the other actors that. They don't like me. They always seem to want to play against me.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you take a look at the poster of John Waters's Pink Flamingos, there you'll see a picture of a beautiful woman, with a perfect body, a perfectly trimmed, black frock-coat, a white blouse, a little black, red, and green scarf, and a pink flambeaux. The movie takes a page out of the old Alice in Wonderland, as the movie is about "a girl with no legs". (For a long while, Pink Flambeos was a favorite of many a child and a favorite subject of many an art-school child.)  I don't know much about this movie. My favorite aspect of it is the dialogue.  Waters has an uncanny knack of coming up with really good jokes, that are both clever and clever at the same time.  It doesn't help that Waters also does a wonderful job of filming.  This movie is very funny.   It is an odd picture in that it is not very interesting. There is a scene at a wedding where the bride is forced to give a toast in which she says she doesn't want to be called a flamingo.  There is also a scene where a man walks around with his hands up, refusing to say the name of the town.  The movie also has a few funny, out-of-place moments.  But all in all, I like it, and it is a real rarity that a movie is made in which the actors (including an actress) seem to be totally serious.  Some people dislike Pink Flamedos, and I can certainly understand where they are coming from.  However, when you compare Pink Flamel to Alice in the Wonderland, I think I can safely state that Pink Flamm is actually better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most amazing performance by the late Steve McQueen is in this film. He does a marvelous job.   The following statement is so good that I am sure it must be true:   The best movie about life in the early 1970's is "The Great Race".   It is a great movie. It is an excellent film about the time in America before the AIDS epidemic. It was when people still loved and admired each other. It had a lot of great stories. It also had some really bad stories. I can't even remember what they were all about. It doesn't matter. It's not a good film. It isn't even really a good motion picture. It has bad stories, a bad acting group, and a bad script. But it was a lot more fun than many other movies out there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good thriller and also a great look at a couple who had problems finding love:  I have had this movie a long time. This was the movie that got me through a bad time in my life. As a teenager in the early 1980s, I wasn't really happy in a long way. I had problems with my schoolwork, I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, I was in love with my beautiful girlfriend (now wife), and my parents didn't seem to want to give me a very supportive home life. The only positive thing I remember about these problems was that I felt I had a wonderful girlfriend. After the movie we had a chance to do a Q&A on the phone. I was talking to a friend who was a teacher in a junior high school, and was trying to get his son into the movie. We watched it together and it was great! I remember a couple of the problems the parents had, and how a kid can learn something new every day about love, friendship, and family. My question for these parents was "Who was the man in the blue suit?". And the answer is that he was the kid and that the dad was trying his best to make the best of a bad situation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has a number of very memorable scenes, including one that almost gave me chills.   One of my favorite aspects of this movie was the humor.  It is very clever, and at times is even clever and funny. The characters are not very well defined, but the actors seem to get along with each other, and that is what is important.  In the end, this is a rather well written, but somewhat simple, movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When The Crow: City of Angels first came out, I had no expectations. I'm going to be completely honest here, the film was a total disappointment to me. I've always thought the idea was interesting and I have a soft spot for the film, but this was a complete disappointment. I don't think the movie was even entertaining to watch. The actors were absolutely terrible in what was supposed to be a very important role. The music and cinematography was also horrible. It didn't even try to convey the dark and moody atmosphere of the city. For some reason, the people who played these roles were supposed to look like they did in their old age. It is a complete waste of time and money. It just made me sad.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My buddy and I went to see this and the rest of the great '90s comedies. First off, the movie is funny. And it's funny in every way possible - funny and clever, and a little tongue-in-cheek. Then we had a few minutes of actual comedy which were so good that my wife and I looked forward to it at every opportunity. We laughed a few times and there were some excellent effects. But the best part of the film is the performance by Bill Murray. He makes so many jokes (and he does them all perfectly) and seems to have no trouble with the material, and you wonder why so many other actors would choose to not be in the movie. I found it funny all the way through - but I didn't think it would ever get any higher than a 3.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love science fiction, and I love bad movies.   This is a very bad movie with an awful story. I'm really embarrassed to admit that I don't remember any of the dialog in this movie. All I can recall are scenes and characters that have changed in the last ten minutes.  One of the more bad-looking characters was played by Charles Laughton.  He could have been better, but at least he was in it.  This movie could have had better acting by every single actor involved.  It makes me wonder how many good science fiction movies have been made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In my opinion, the best example of a great "bad movie" ever made is this:    A bunch of idiots, including the director, a producer, a writer and an audience member, run around in a town looking for a black bear that they killed.   They meet a couple of old guys who tell them about a big white bear and how it looks like it has a head like a duck and a tail like a fish. Then they run across a man dressed like a bear running around and having a tough time, so they decide to find him.  The movie has a bunch of good jokes and some great fight scenes. There is no need to watch this movie. It is bad, and it is the worst bad movie I have ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a real good movie for a real bad time.  It has all the trappings that make a good film:    The old ladies are very funny (not that they should be).     And the action scene is not to be missed.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While the movie is not as good as the books, it's pretty darn good.   It has some of the best scenes in any fantasy book, but then also has some really bad ones.  There's also some really odd humor here and there.  If you liked the books then you'll like this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie with a lot of energy and adventure in it. It also has a sense of humor and a nice little story that just keeps me going.    The film was directed by the great, Jim Cameron (Aliens, Terminator 2, Avatar). The cast is terrific. I was a little bit disappointed that some characters were left out of the movie. The movie definitely does have its moments. It gets into the action quite a bit and gets all the actors to deliver their best performances.  This movie is fun and very entertaining.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A classic, with a beautiful soundtrack. If you like this kind of film, you'll enjoy the rest of the movie: a family in grief is visited one afternoon by a mysterious visitor. It turns out that this person is a reincarnation of the man who killed his family in a car crash, only a few years ago. A new life is created; and the new family must face up to their terrible past.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So it was a long way back to the city that never was when I first found out about a "Dolce Vita" series with the legendary (read: crazy) writer of Italian movies Luciano Pavarotti. As I listened to the narration from the famous "The Little Prince," "Wizard of Oz," "Beauty and the Beast" and other classics, I knew that this book would be a classic. I'm glad that it was!   First of all, why did I wait this long to read this book? I didn't buy this book for me to read, and I don't think that I could've cared less if I did. The book's concept is simple: Luciano is one of Hollywood's greatest storytellers, a composer whose compositions often evoke an emotion that is almost indescribable (and which is said to be the reason why Pavarotto is an "expert" singer in the first place). There are several movies that describe life in Rome, some very positive ones, others very negative ones (I like the last one, it's sad). These "tapes," which you can buy to relive them in a more comfortable way, are then shown to one of the city's wealthiest "downtown dwellers" named Giorgio, who in his desperation sells his soul to the devil and becomes a demon. Luciano, in a great show of friendship, tries to save the guy from his fate.   For those who are interested in the book's plot, the book is pretty simple. It has some characters we don't know very well and are introduced at a couple of levels of detail. There are a lot of very funny parts here. Most of the time I was laughing and I'm sure some of you will as well. I never found this book too dull, there are plenty of surprises and a pretty epic final part, which was a lot better than the first part.   that is all there is to the book. It is certainly the best way to see how some of the greats were made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Son is one of those movies that will not let its audience down. It is a tale of love lost and a father trying to find it, and if that sounds a bit like a fairy tale, well, there is a reason for that. However, the author does a superb job in telling that tale with such perfect clarity that the audience is almost completely immersed in it. If you can handle a bit of melancholy and some pretty dark content, the Good Son will have your heart swelling and beating with joy every time the ending music starts up. You may want to let yourself go now so the whole experience can be experienced without being carried along by the author, and don't worry, you will not be disappointed!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember seeing this movie during my sophomore year at college. My boyfriend and I spent a day at the mall. I remember being disappointed with the amount of crap in the movie. I couldn't get into the movie for whatever reason. I loved it when I saw it in college. Now, years later, I am enjoying the movie again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was looking for something about vampires to watch, and I'm not kidding: in this vampire movie, we have a beautiful girl and a handsome vampire, both of them are played by a certain John Malkovich (the movie isn't bad), and they both come to find a man who's been killed by a vampire while he was hunting a vampire in the woods, the man is not so lucky, and while his friend is trying to save him, the vampire has a little talk with the man and tries to get him to talk as well, they do though (they are really fun together) and they do eventually manage to work up the courage to attack the vampire, who is an arrogant vampire who's not really too good at attacking humans.  The movie starts off pretty funny (there's a little kid, who gets possessed by a werewolf, but it's a pretty silly way of showing the werewolf) and it gradually gets more weird, but that's a good thing: you want it to be weird, you don't want it not to be: in fact the only good thing about the movie is that it is quite long, and has its moments (it's a movie about werewolves, after all). However, it is not really any kind of vampire movie (there were never any vampires in the movie, but the whole thing is set in a small cabin that's inhabited by a group of vampires, and it doesn't really do much to make the characters that much more memorable than the ones in "The Thing", it's more of a "how did they survive" story) but it still is one of those movies that you will probably remember, and for that reason it's worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In every way an astonishing movie in this period of time. A very serious drama which is a great picture and an interesting story.  - March 15, 2007I never saw an action movie like this before  Reviewer: mr. lance - favorite favorite favorite - October 26, 2006  Subject: A very tough man to understand. This is a movie that, while not necessarily being the best, is definitely the most important in the genre. The story is interesting and, while the story is more about love than the story about action, it is hard to understand him as an average person and to relate to him as something more. It's hard to believe this guy is more than a few years older than him. The whole story makes me think that there is an underlying moral to this movie that is lost in translation.  And if you look closely at the guy in the movie, it's actually hard to tell whether this is the guy from "Spartacus" or the guy "Trucks." - October 25, 2006A very tough person to understand  Reviews: 3 - February 4, 2006Nice Action Scene  2 - January 31, 2006Very Interesting Story  3 - January 29, 2006Interesting movie with good action sequences, with the man portrayed well as a complex character. But there is just something missing: to understand the man, there has to be more information provided as well. So, for example, you get a lot of information about his life, but there's no explanation why he became such a tough guy; there's nothing that gives a clue as to why he would try to get revenge on those who killed his children. But he is an interesting figure, and is a good representation of the "bad guy" type (see "Spiral" and "Cobra" for more examples). - January 26, 2005Interesting Movie - Interesting Man - Interesting Story I really enjoyed this movie: I got it right after I saw it. It had a lot going for it that I loved: good action, good characters and even good writing. And it really has a great and unique concept: a man who has been a soldier in the middle ages is sent out to find the daughter of a king who has disappeared in France. He does not do so well at all: the girl has gone insane, he is beaten to a bloody pulp, his face is disfigured by a beating, and he gets
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's no way you haven't seen this movie by now. The fact that it was only about a million or so dollars back when it was in the theaters has made it an impossible bargain to find these days. If you haven be lucky enough to find it in a VHS store, you have no excuse for not watching it. There have been numerous versions, each with a different cast and director, but this one has been by far the most well thought out. It's a well-paced movie, and I've only seen a few of these made, and it's no wonder there are so many great movies out there!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The reason why this movie didn't get any more attention was that it was in color. Now, if the movie has to be in color, it must be good! This movie is amazing! It's one of my favorite sci-fi movies from the 1960's. This movie has got to be the best sci-fiction movie ever. It's a classic and that's why its going to stay in my top 10! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is well made, well-crafted, well acted and a very good story with good plot twists.   The actors are good, I am impressed by how well all the cast are playing.  The story is not too long so if you don't want to watch this on your lunch break or your lunch hour you can go for the day and not worry about dinner or sleep.  I am enjoying this movie more and more because it is entertaining and a fun movie in itself. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very good action-adventure movie which is the equivalent of a good novel. It is a fast paced movie with lots of action scenes and it ends quite quickly.   I like the characters and the fact that there are no superpowers in this movie. I just like watching it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For an hour and a half, I did not know whether to laugh, scream or go into a coma.   The script from a director with such an uncanny resemblance to Stephen King is both an homage and a parody of what makes Stephen King so popular - a good old fashioned scary story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorite movies of the last year was the  Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer  movie, and a great addition to Disney's classic Christmas movies. I also love  The Little Mermaid  and  Beauty and the Beast  but  Rudolph  has to be one of my favorites.   It's a very fun movie and, to this day, I'm not sure why I didn't see it earlier.  It might be because I'm an older boy and as I said, sometimes a little boy (or a little girl) just wants to run around and play, and sometimes a good, old-fashioned, scary, scary story can help them relax. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been a fan of the Coen brothers since they released The Big Lebowski.  The Coen's are my heroes!  But there was a problem... I wasn't a huge fan of Mr. Lebowitz.    As a guy with a little background in martial arts (he does some stand up comedy), I thought Mr.Lebowitz would be a better movie than Mr. Coen.  He has one bad movie after another.  I thought he was going to be a little better when he showed up for the funeral of his late father.  So I went to the cemetery to honor his memory.  When I got to the grave, the two men standing near it were Mr. and Mrs.Lebowitz....and the coffin itself had a gun in it, which made me uncomfortable.  This bothered me enough that I was able to sneak away.  Then I went right back to the movie and was not disappointed.  It was a good old fashioned Western.  The script was smart, the acting was on par with the Coens, and it had a really nice musical score that I loved.  A lot of movie goers were turned off by it, but I was pleased to see that some people liked it and that we don't really know Mr.Lebenowitz.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about a boy named Nick who comes from a rich but broken family. He lives in a large house with his sisters, his parents and his cousin. The aunt spends her life trying to protect her nephew from bullies who constantly come to his house. While the aunt is doing this, Nick's cousin, a beautiful girl, is being raped and murdered in front of him. The only thing he does is to try to protect the cousin from being raped again and to try and get the girl out of the house. So what does Nick do? Well, he finds out that he has an unusual talent. He can talk to animals. And so he starts trying to teach them how to behave, how to learn to respect their elders, and what not. And the first time this happens he is attacked by some animals and is nearly killed. And he gets angry. I don't know what is supposed to happen next. It would have been good to have Nick become a teacher.    And then he gets to see the world in a new way. So you might say, "Wow. The boy gets to go to all the places that he wants to go. And then at the end you have an orphan and an aunt. And a girl and a tiger."   I've never understood this movie, but that isn't a bad description. It doesn't help that most people who have seen it don't like the movie, and this makes it a sad and depressing movie.  This was made in 1963 and I can understand that the budget was very small. As is common with movies made in the early 1960s, this movie was made for about $50,000.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is good and there is a good story in it too.  The story is about a group of friends in Chicago,  who are also friends with a woman who is an actress. They are often together when she goes on a trip to New York and they have a great time. Then she decides that this trip is over and she will never see her friends in New York ever again.   This is where the movie begins.  It shows us the whole trip with the actress and her friends. We also see the two friends at the end of the trip and they realize that they need to be closer together. They get into an accident and she is seriously injured and she asks them to take her back to Chicago to finish her acting career.    It is a very touching and moving movie and it is well worth the watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After the great success of  Morty's Mind Blowers, which was my favorite movie of last season (don't get me wrong,  it was still really good), we were treated to another one this season:  The Big Bang Theory.  This is a show where every week we see the show's characters get into various misadventures with the help of various people they know.  This show is a bit of a departure for the show, as it focuses a bit more on the science than before.  We're seeing more time spent on theoretical physics than previously, and it's all done very well.  There are also a few fun scenes in the first episode where Sheldon, Leonard, and Raj are in the library doing a science project together.  I have to say that I actually really enjoyed this new spin on the show (though I'll admit I do like the old show quite a bit as well).  Even better, it was a surprisingly funny show.  Despite the rather serious story lines, this show managed to be quite entertaining at times.  If you're looking for a laugh, it's hard to beat this show. This show isn't a show that I'd watch all the time, but I'm glad there are shows like this.  It's not a bad show, but it isn't great either.  The ending isn't too bad either.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great, gritty, dramatic, fast-paced, and gripping film! The story follows the story of one man, who is about to be executed for killing a child molester who is being tried by the state. He claims to have committed a terrible crime which could only have happened in the present day, where the child molesters have moved in larger numbers due to the war on terror. His defense is simple: there is no greater danger than those who enjoy the destruction of innocent lives. The film is well-acted and suspenseful, and features a wonderful soundtrack in John Wayne and a very cool ending. It is a good crime thriller, and one you'll want to watch again and again. - September 25, 2011Highly Recommended

It's an easy film to watch and a great way to end the movie season.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found myself on board the "Star Trek" bandwagon at age seven, and by the time I was twelve, I was completely hooked.   The original series and the films are still my favourite television series of all time, and the new films are just as good:  "Star Wars: A New Hope," "A New Hope" (the original), "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi" - all great.  But the most memorable episode of the Star Trek franchise, I'd argue, is the one that aired only once, and only because it did its job well:  The original "Star Fleet" ran for a mere thirteen episodes between 1966 and 1968.  To watch it in a theatre, though, would be like watching a full-length movie!   This episode, entitled "The City on the Edge of Forever," is essentially just a story about a crewman and a planet-killing asteroid in a small, low-gravity environment, but as the Enterprise's crew gradually become disoriented, things do get a little out of hand.  I've seen the new Blu-rays, and all of the acting is spot on.  It's also great to hear the voices of Nichelle Nichols and William Shatner back again - Nichols has always seemed more like a character from a Saturday morning cartoon than a starship captain, and Shat is one of my favourite actors ever.  The episode is an enjoyable little mystery:  What happened to the crew of the Enterprise? How did they meet? Why do they have these strange dreams?  And the ending is just plain creepy:  The Enterprise crew's dreams, in the original series version, that is.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of those movies you just have to see, or at least listen to, for a while. The song, "The Great Pumpkin," plays throughout, and it's a great tune.   I would have given this movie five stars, had it not been for the ending.  I've been to an end of the world party, so I know about the Great Pumpkin, and the story of the wicked witch that was supposed to bring it to earth and wipe out mankind. I had the sense that this wasn't just any Great Pumpkin. It was supposed, perhaps, to come out of a tree on a farm. So I'm thinking, "What are the odds that this is a Great Pumpkin?" I mean it's obviously a little different from a pumpkin we get out of the ground, right?   The Witch's trickery involves some very clever stuff: getting a small child to fall in love with the Pumpkin, getting the pumpkin out of its cage so it can escape the woods with a young man, using the same trick on some people she knows, and setting the Great Pumpkins in different woods so no one will find it. It's a smart and clever trick, but also very silly and childish. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie takes a classic story, and puts the twist in it. The film begins with two old men (both played by Burt Lancaster) walking through the countryside and talking about their lives. The older man is reminiscing about his happy childhood. The other man is much more reflective. He recalls his lost love, his life before the war, and the hardships he experienced before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Both men discuss their lives in an effort to gain some understanding as to why a young couple from St. Louis has fallen in love so hard. One night, two young men are seen near the young couple's house. The young couple seems surprised at the sight of these strangers. The men don't seem to care as they stare into the distance. The only comment the young couples make is about the weather. This is a very strange thing to see coming from two young people. The next night, a man (played by David Niven) arrives at the house. He is accompanied by two men (played with great passion by Walter Pidgeon and Henry Fonda). The men seem to know the old couple by sight. When they arrive, the old man gets dressed and leaves for the door. He then calls his wife on the phone. The two old gentlemen appear at her door. The husband is very excited, but then turns to his older friend. He says, "I'm going to get into the bathroom. Get the faucet started." They enter the bathroom together. The man closes the door and steps into the tub. He turns around and sees the man from the other room. He stands in the tub looking down at the man. The old man takes a step back and takes the other man by the arm. They walk in the bathroom and into another room. The new man is shocked when he first sees the new face in the mirror. He thinks it's a joke or a trick, until the two old guys turn the mirror around to reveal a very old woman (played, of course, by Brigitte Bardot). She is dressed in a very uncomfortable bathing suit that has a hole through it. She has no eyebrows or eyelashes, and her face is covered with a bandanna. She appears to be in her late 20's. She is wearing a large green hat with an American flag on it. On a nearby shelf is a bottle of whisky. The younger man is very nervous when the two older men enter the room. However, the two
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A brilliant script from Paul Verhoeven that was to become an early master piece.  As with "The Fifth Element" in 1998, this is a film that takes an idea and develops it further.  The film follows a young college grad named Jack Stone (Michael J. Fox) who is trying to live a normal life with his girlfriend, Lisa (Melissa George).    They are driving through New York when Stone experiences some weirdness.   One night, he is attacked by an invisible, flying demon.    Jack is unable to fight off the monster until he sees the sign "Welcome to Hell."   The demon attacks again, but this time it is an evil version of his beloved grandfather.  This is where the film starts to really get weird.  After this, they head for the border of America.  From what I can find, this story has been told many times before.  However, the only similarities are that the demon, and a man who was born on the wrong day.  It is a perfect match of the original film, that was released in 1999.  While the story is very different, there is a lot of the same story.  Jack and Lisa try to survive in America, but the reality is not what it seems.  The film is really well put together.  A lot of different scenes are shot with great style.  There are some weird scenes as well, but they all work together to create a very unique film.  I don't think I have seen a movie as crazy and entertaining as this in a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dukes of Hazzard  is a fun cartoon series that starts off strong with a "Who's Who" of old American heroes. As the series progresses it is the relationships in Hazzards crew that make it the great American TV show it is.  This is the same crew that would go on to form the Laverne & Shirley  wagon.  And, that's just as it should be.  I'm a sucker for a good old fashioned slapstick family comedy.    If you enjoy my humor and the series of cartoons I do for  The Wacky Adventures of Vin Scully,  Wacko!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was really amazed by what I saw.  It's one of the best movies I've ever seen.    The story is about a young man who is being forced to marry an older woman.  She is a witch, so the marriage is supposed to be a happy one.  As the plot progresses the evil side of the old woman comes out and becomes a lot more interesting.  I thought that the writing was really good.  A few lines could be changed so that it is about the old lady, but the movie as a whole is still great.  This is a pretty good movie, which should have its screen time.  It is rated R, so we could be looking at a R-rated film in the near future. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a classic of the first and second world war, starring the great Charles Laughton as a young officer with an over-the-top laugh that's not only hilarious but causes the enemy to panic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So the film is about a guy who just recently got out of prison (from a serious case of being raped and murdered), so that is about to change when he begins a new career as a lawyer. His new client wants to make a movie of his life with his new friend (who happens to be his brother), so his brother is forced to watch. The guy is also a little crazy, but he tries his best to make the most of every scene. Not so much, because the guy is the most over the top asshole ever, who does everything to screw things up for everybody! The movie is filled with such good moments of comedy: The brother's car wreck; "If I don't get to the store, I'm a failure" ; the friend and his brother in the bar; The brother getting shot in the face with a toy gun by a gangster; and so on. It also does a nice job of showing the brother's anger and how that affects everyone around him. The movie also has many scenes that are worth watching, including one in which the brother has the nerve to go into a restaurant that he knows the owner personally (who is a little out of his mind), and he is about ready to attack the owner with a golf club when the owner asks to meet him at the back door instead, so the brother decides to kill the owner and himself. It's pretty hard to watch, but it's worth a watch!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first heard about this movie I wasn't impressed. I had heard good things about this film, and had watched it on television. But after seeing it I'm glad I did! The movie was great. The story was a little confusing at times, but when it hit a nice tone I was hooked. I was surprised by how much the plot was told through characters' eyes. I never thought it possible to make a movie about how hard it is to break into the music business. But this movie made me a believer. That's what really impressed me.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you think of horror movies you usually think of vampires. That is not the case here in this film though as there is a lot of supernatural shenanigans going on.   The pacing is quite slow, with a small amount of tension and plenty of scares.  There is enough blood in the movie to keep the kids happy.  It does not go out of hand in the most frightening moments though. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've just finished the newest instalment of the Twilight saga.   It's a very good movie.  I really think it has the potential to get better over the next film, but I can't see how this film will be superior to the Twilight Saga, a movie which I would go out on a limb and say is a perfect movie. I think this movie is closer to the last Twilight film in that it has more in common with another movie from Twilight, which is what Twilight Saga is supposed to be.  This movie is definitely darker in tone than the last movie. The main character, Bella, is definitely more of a villain and it's a lot of fun to see her struggle to come to terms with the fact that she's suddenly become the target of a group of vampires who want her dead.  There are some pretty good set ups in the movie. They have the two vampires, who have been stalking Bella, find out that she has been sleeping with a young boy, who Bella believes is a vampire.  They plan to get him dead (by way of an accidental vampire-killing) and kill Bella while she's sleeping.  After all is said and done, there are some really good moments, and I really like the look of Bella. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "There is a scene in the movie which depicts a large, black dog that has a huge black tongue, a very long neck and a black, sharp, pointy nose. The dog is shown jumping at one of the guards and biting him on the neck. The film opens with a man named Walter Sorensen, who owns a black cat called "Dandy". He is a bad man who is a sadistic man, who is in a sad way sadistic because of his sadism.   His sadism has come to the end of the line, his soul is about to be crushed and he has no one to turn to anymore.  Walter has been searching for a black female cat for about a year.  He buys the cat for a certain amount of money, but the cat has never been home and he suspects the cat is dead.  However, he gets a letter from the cat, and upon reading the letter the black cat has returned to life.  Sorente says to Soren the story of the cat.  When he tells the story to Sorenson his wife (the woman who is being tortured in the film) and her sister start to laugh at the story.  So Walter tells the tale again and the whole family starts laughing again.  This movie has that "dark comedy" feeling to it.  You just know that something is going to happen and it does.  A black, evil, cruel dog, the evil spirit of the black woman's husband, a black man with a long nose and a pointed nose, a white man who loves his cat so much that he does anything for her, a strange black cat, a weird, evil looking man and a very, very, black cat.     Sorenten is a real life "Dracula."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched all the episodes of a TV Series which took place in the same universe as The Prisoner and The Prison Escape. I loved all the stories that I saw in the TV Series: The Prisoners, The Prison, The War Room, The Red Room, and even the small parts which appeared in The Prison. All the characters from this TV Series are back again in a TV movie. They get together, they play a little game, they have some fun and eventually they all start to get killed.   This is a really fun TV series, with an all star cast of actors. I would recommend it to you, especially the parts where they play some kind of fun card game.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was really disappointed when I heard there was a movie called The Devil Rides Out   but I was not to be disappointed as this is a great film and a great movie you should check it out.   The film begins with a short description of the events leading to the devil's appearance and how the devil is in need of the help of a good woman who is willing to give up her virginity to help her devil.  When the devil first appears he takes the woman's virginity by force and then forces her to tell him she loves him.  After some time of her telling him this he tells her to lie still and be silent and then take off her clothes and then he takes control of the situation and forces her back to the woods and forces the woman to drink a special drink which will kill her if she drinks it as they have no antidote.  The woman eventually gets into the woods so he can put the antidote in her drink and then they escape together.  There are a number of scenes in the film that give a good insight into the workings of the devil and also how the man was a poor choice to get a girl in his hands to do such a thing.  Despite the fact that some of the scenes are quite horrific I enjoyed the film quite a lot and I believe this is one of the better bad movies ever made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is a bit of a head-scratcher.  The story is about a pair of brothers who are being held as prisoners in a castle.  They are told that if they confess to being thieves the castle will be put to rights.  After being told this by their guards, they decide to steal a gold coin.  Unfortunately, this gold coin was never found, and the two brothers are caught.  Their guards, however, are no fools.  One of them is able to steal the gold from the brothers' cell, and puts it on display.  Meanwhile, the other guard is also on his way to steal their gold, and he too is caught by the guards.  Both men are taken into the castle and are interrogated about where the gold coin is.  Although there is never a clear answer from the interrogators, they conclude that the gold is in the castle's stables and that it is likely that the brothers have taken it to the stables, but they have gone to the wrong stables.  These men believe that once the gold has been taken, it is not possible to return to it.  For this reason, they believe that the two Brothers have escaped and that they need to get the gold back. There are many good scenes in the film.  First off, there are scenes of the guards and their inquisitors getting into a lively exchange of words.  As they are about to go to bed one of the inquisifiers says that their conversation could be very interesting.  There is also a scene where the inquiser gives the guards a gift to help them get over their nervousness.  That is just one of many good bits of film-making.  I enjoyed the movie as much as I did because I always enjoy a movie that will keep me entertained.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was looking to watch this movie and the internet was giving me the answer that it was not a good film. I'm surprised by that. What is also surprising is that it doesn't seem too bad at all. There is a scene where they show a woman jumping off the edge of a cliff (yes I watched the movie and I saw it). If I hadn't already heard that this film was bad, I would have missed the sight. I liked that it showed us the beauty that is the ocean, and the great cliffs that lead up to it. I like that it shows us some wonderful creatures and some of the different ways they live. As for the acting, they are not bad. They are believable and are used well. It's easy to get into the mood and it is not overly long. It has some wonderful images and is pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a funny movie.  The most of the comedy is funny, and the rest is not.    The comedy is fairly strong.  The film is funny.  It's not a lot funnier than a standard 80's action film.  In the 80's, that's all you needed.  If that were all you would have got, well...   So we can't fault the humor.  I'm just not a big fan of the "I don't give a shit" thing that a lot of the film's characters have.  Not to say the film is all-bad.  Sure, it's goofy.  But for a comedy this bad, it at least has a lot going for it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie in its own right. It would also be a good show to see, if it wasn't that way. At the very end of the movie, while everyone is running away from what's happening, the camera zooms in to show the kids in the woods, as they sit down to enjoy themselves. There's a really cute little girl in the movie and it's just so refreshing to see a movie in which the main characters are actually funny and endearing.  If you like a little bit of goofy, this is a good comedy to watch with your kids.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really loved this movie. I didn't hate it and I really loved it, so I guess I like it. If you like it, then you love it. So, what makes it unique? Why the hell did nobody ever think of this before? Why do people keep turning this down as bad movie, when it's so much more than that?  This movie is really just an old man trying to live out a bad dream. It's a really bad movie. You'd think a remake would bring a lot more to it, but they made a pretty good movie. The story is predictable and the acting is just awful, and the ending was even more lame. There was a really interesting character in a weird situation, but it didn't get any more interesting than the rest of the plot. It made you want to see the movie over and over, but in the end you're probably wishing the old man wasn't really an old guy, because he's really not all that interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved    and  !   It is quite a treat to watch a great movie and I would give it a B+ or B!  This movie is an absolute gem and I wish   were more like it.   My favorite part was the bit where there is a dog that jumps out of a window and runs down the streets chasing a squirrel. I laughed out loud and the other people laughed, too.  I was also surprised to learn how old the movie is.  The opening scene, with the dog, the squirrel, the old man and the policeman - that was just the funniest thing I'd seen all day, and I loved it all the way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I was a little girl, I used to watch the animated series called Sesame Street every day. One of my favorites was called Elmo's World, which featured a little green monster called Elmos who became a TV star. It was all fun and games, until one day Elmos and Miss Piggy, Elmo and a bunch of other little Elmos all ran away from home. The Elmo from Elmos World lived with a couple of pigs and he decided to go to a movie. And all of a sudden the pigs all started to fight the movie star Elmo. The little Elmo started to get into trouble as the pigs tried to run out of the place. So Elmo was all alone and the pigs were making fun of him for being a little elf and a "little green pig". So a little Elme ran out of his house and went in search of the little green Elmo who was all by himself. But Elmo wasn't there. And a big angry pig ran over to Elmo to attack him. And Elmo did the most awesome Elmo roar and he knocked the pig out, and then he ran off with the little Elma. Elmo later ran out to find Elma again. Elma was all messed up and she was really mad at the pigs because she was hurt. And then Elmo ran up and talked to Elma and said "Elmos are really smart and they are good at all the things we see all around us. They do it all. If there was a movie about a world without any of us, we would be so much better off. We would be able to be a better Elmos than we are now. You would be much happier." Elmo talked to the pig and said that he was sorry and he would be back in time to help the pigs again. They went back to the scene where the Elmo in Elmos world lived and Elmo got a little elmo friend named Frodo Baggins. Elmoes Elmo eventually got into trouble and when the pigs found out who the little guy was they had to put a stop to him. So the big pigs and Elmos went to a theater and they got into a big fight. Elmos was so big that the fight was all his fault, and the little boy Elmo just got in the way and made it worse. So Frodo got really mad and started to tear up all the other people there, and he was

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've not seen every movie in the series, but I do know the first two movies. There was a period where the franchise was really bad, and at one point in time, it looked like it wouldn't be returning for a while. When this film was first released on DVD a few years ago, it caught me by surprise. There are no major flaws with this movie, the first half of the story is pretty good (especially the part where the kids find a treasure map) and the last third of the movie is pretty bad. I won't go into the other movies here because I watched the first 2 and didn't like them that much. I didn't mind the first movie either, I think it was a decent movie.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is great, one of the better fantasy films to come out recently. Although we all know that Tolkien was a bit of a bastard there was nothing that made me laugh (no one did - it was a classic - a great love story - and very faithful to the source material) and it is one of those movies that you get sucked into it and never want it to end, a great movie and a real treat to sit down and enjoy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is not a bad movie, but I do think it is very much in the middle of the pack. There is not much for this movie to wow us.   The story is not very interesting.  I think it would be better if the movie had been a little more about our two men, not about their lives together.  A better story would have made this a much better film, but as a thriller it is just average. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a film of the style of the film "Wag the Dog". It has the same elements, but does not follow it exactly. The plot is about an old farmer who lives with his wife and three daughters. One day the old man finds that his youngest daughter is pregnant. He is very angry at the girl, who he thinks does not love him. His wife is very annoyed with him for his moodiness and her having to go out into the woods to go to a woman's house so often. The old woman decides that the girl needs to learn to look at the world through a slightly different point of view. The husband and father are not so lucky. They do not like the new girl. They think that the new boy is better looking and better behaved than the old boy. The girl is more concerned about the boy. One night the old woman finds a note left by the boy in the woods. He wants to find out why the boy is always playing with a girl. Later on, the new mother brings the old mother to the old girl and reveals to her that her son was playing a prank. They are talking about the same thing. A few years later, the old farmer, who lives alone now, moves to another place. He has a beautiful house. He goes to a new place, which is the same as the first place, and takes the new baby into his arms. The baby is still the same, it is still beautiful, it still speaks in the same way. The new father does not like it very much. The two fathers have their own opinions and do not get along very well. When the new father hears that the old father is still angry with the girl for what happened. He tries to find the girl again. The little boy who lives there, does not know of anything and is quite frightened. He hides in the cellar and runs away crying. The farmer finds him a few years after and brings the baby back. He does not want to talk to the new dad but does get along pretty well. The story ends when a stranger walks into the picture house.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this film, a high school girl, Shizuko, is tormented by her boyfriend, Tsubasa, who is a girl dressed like a boy and acts in all ways like a girl. She is a normal girl; she likes to swim in the sea, listen to music and watch movies. Her only friends are a man named Tsubaki and a group of high school girls called the "Dolls" whom she hangs around with because they are very pretty. A couple of times, she is torched (in the chest) by Tsubasi, who takes revenge when she gets in the wrong place (for example, swimming in the water in summer, wearing shorts). She also becomes romantically involved with a friend named Yuki, whom she likes a lot (she's cute and has a little crush on her, even though it's not really reciprocated). The girls in her school are all so jealous of Tsubasas, that some even try to drive him off (she ends up in the hospital with her boyfriend). Written by Ryo Kanda <ryu@ky.u-shiki.ac.jp>
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's plenty to complain about when it comes to the screenplay of this film.  For starters, it seems the writers didn't get the basic idea of how to end a film. When a film is a thriller, it has to end with a bang.    It's no good if the end credits roll with a couple of long shots that show us nothing in particular as a message.  Also, it's rather annoying how the film starts with a bunch of random characters walking around.  This is just lazy storytelling and not much else to say about it.  Finally, the ending is rather abrupt and rushed.  After all the hype, they decided to end the film without a cliffhanger and with a rather weak ending.  But when it is all said and done, I still felt the need to give it a good rating.  I enjoyed this movie and had some decent laughs at times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are a few things that just don't make much sense in this movie. Not the acting either. It really looks like they shot it in a different state and just used stock footage from old Disney movies and did the same thing with it. It looks like the director was trying to make something as "Disney-like" as possible and it doesn't really work. It was a low budget movie with poor production values and it looked bad. I give it an eight instead of a half because it was really bad but it was still a good little movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you are like me who has been wanting to see this movie for almost 15 years, then I must say that I love it. I have never seen this film, so I have no words to describe just how good it is. It is also very funny. This is a real-life thriller with a supernatural twist, so the story is fast-paced and fast-thinking. It takes a while to get the plot going, but the story really picks up when it does. It will definitely take you back to your youth. This movie is very good. I loved it so much, I wish I could see it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "What a film!  What a story!"  -  George C. Scott  (Burt Lancaster in The Red Badge of Courage ) I had seen The Long Goodbye a few years ago, and I was blown away.  I was in an airport a few weeks ago, going to a friend's house for the night, and there was this old man sitting right on a seat right next to me.      I asked, "How're you?"  He was smiling, and saying, "Well, I don't know, I was just in a good mood.  My old friend, Frank Sinatra, is in town tonight, and he's coming to the airport to perform.  I got a ticket to meet him, and after I got my ticket, I thought "Well...I can get him to do a little singing."   And my friend was going to take me, and we thought we might have a few songs and some jokes...so we did.  Frank Sinatran was wonderful and kind, and so we had a good time.  After Sinatra took a couple of pictures with me, he told me that it was okay if I got up to say goodbye.  He said, "It's been a pleasure having you, I hope I see you around again soon."  And he walked off to the end of the plane.    Well, I couldn't get to the door fast enough.  And the very next minute, he was at my window with this little girl, and she looked at me, like "Mr. Sinatra?"  And I said, "Oh, my!"  She looked at Frank Sinatan, like,  "I can't believe it, what a big star."  He put down the camera and he gave me his hand.  "Well",  he said, in a very big voice "It was a pleasure meeting you, my friend."  I said "Well I hope you remember me."  And I walked down the aisle to the left and he was saying goodbye. So I thought it was quite a little story,  and there I sat, at the window, holding Frank Sinatta's hand.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good one. There is a very nice plot, with plenty of adventure and adventure, but the film does have its problems. One of these is that it has a very bad ending. The film is not nearly as good as it claims to be, but I do believe that a director could get away with bad movie endings quite easily, but he definitely went overboard on the last one. I can't help but wonder if the ending was planned to be a last resort. The ending is all downhill from here. This might be an easy movie to laugh at. I have a couple of bad memories from this movie. My mother and I loved it together. I enjoyed it so much that I watched the first 10 minutes, and then went and watched the film in the theater with my dad. I don't think I will ever watch it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best film I've seen so far in 2015 is a great thriller about an evil man who can only be stopped with a good girl (Emma Watson) and some pretty smart moves.   Watson is a brilliant actress.  The first act (not sure I'd call it a movie) is well done.  But then Watson's "supernatural" girlfriend, a "vampire" who is able to turn people into vampires for a price, turns out to be a total bitch.   It's a bit of a "pump & dump" type script.  It doesn't really tell a good story and the climax of the film is a little too cheesy.  I really enjoyed the movie.  If you like movies that involve vampires and sex and are a fan of Watson and the acting abilities of Emma Watson.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I heard about an old timey campy comedy titled "The Love Letter", I immediately wanted to see it. I was expecting to see some old westerns with campy voice acting. Well, let's just say that it is not all that. The comedy here, while it is a bit cheesy, is certainly not offensive. It is, however, somewhat predictable and doesn't really go anywhere new with it's "fantasy world". The main characters are funny and likable. It does, however seem like one of these campy movies that is set in a fictional western or something. The movie is well paced and there is a definite character development when it comes to the characters as the story progresses. If you like old-timey camp comedies, this is definitely a comedy that you should check out.

There are many interesting characters, and the performances are very good.  It will keep you occupied for a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We're never sure exactly where the movie  goes with this, which is why the first act has some excellent character moments, most notably that of a young girl, as she tries to survive,  and a soldier, who finds comfort in the company of his comrade.   I haven't watched  the film since we found out about the murder of its star, but I can  tell you this: the murder  was the last straw for  the director. The actor who played the young girl died of a brain aneurysm after having a very large piece of flesh removed from his head while he was tied to a pole.  The director  immediately went to the police about it, but there's a small problem:  the head of the police department is very sympathetic to the young girl, and the head who ran the department also knows about this man's criminal record, and  she does some digging herself.  The police find the murder weapon on the side of the road, and a dead body on the same road, which makes it  very possible that the men in question are still out there, and they're probably still getting the message out to whoever it is that they want to get. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For fans of the classic "Batman" series this is definitely a step up. There is an air of mystery to the proceedings which gives you a lot of enjoyment, even though the actual action is rather low-key. I especially enjoyed the fact that the action sequences were not confined to the shadows of Gotham's rooftops, but actually incorporated into the city's real life. It's a good thing too because the story could have got very boring very quickly. The story has several "reverses" that come back to haunt Batman in the latter stages of the story, with a few twists and turns that are more than a little confusing, but then again the "Batman and Robin" stories have always been quite confusing from a storytelling point of view, so this isn't all that surprising. There are also quite a few references to "Flash of Two Worlds" which is actually quite enjoyable, although it's a little too easy for some to see a connection with one series and one another. However, overall "Batman - Knightfall" is quite a good story, and as long as it can avoid a few continuity errors it is a fine story in its own right. This was the first in a planned three part series, and the last one is the best of the three. I can't say that I could give it anything above a 4, however, because it just doesn't work as a whole. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie that's well worth seeing (for the sake of an original script and acting). I don't know if I'm alone in thinking this might be the most underrated movie of the year. It's about a couple who have to take care of a cat, and how they come to depend upon the cat. The story is very original and very funny (especially the "cat vs. dog" scene). And it's pretty funny at the end... - August 11, 2008Totally underrated and funny  Reviewer: mrkennedy - favorite favorite favorite - March 28, 2008  Subject: Good, but forgettable I have to admit, I wasn't very excited to watch this. It was the first movie I saw where there was no dialogue and no character development, and it was a good one. But the script is nothing worth reading. We are told, and shown, almost nothing of anything. It is a comedy of errors. There are no real "jokes" in the movie, because we don't really need them, since we see and hear them, and we laugh all the way through the movie. The film is only really funny in its second half, when the characters go to a cat-and-dog show. It seems the cat is much more interesting than the dogs (he's a cat), and it seems like the dogs are more interesting (they are dogs). But that's about it. I am not sure if this movie is worth watching, other than for the comedy. - March 27, 2008Good, but...  The review is only partially true, because there were a few jokes in the first part of the movie that are funny. But most of them are just repeated throughout the movie: "There's a dog for you!" "Dog: I'm a cat." "Dog has a cat for a brother. Dog's a good dog!" "I can't believe the dog ate the cat!" "The dog has a dog brother. I'm the dog's dog-brother." "I don't believe this dog! He is eating a cat!" Well, I guess most people would find the first couple of jokes funny and funny, because they are only repeating, so it doesn't get boring. Also, most of the other jokes don't stick. Even though a few of them work better than the ones in the last half of the film, most don't and they don't make much sense. The only

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen this movie for awhile so I thought I would review it for others who may also have forgotten about it.   The whole movie is an epic that shows how our world might become a far more horrible place without nuclear weapons.  This film features a few "high-profile" (or "highlight reel", I don't know how to describe it) people like: George Bush and Saddam Hussein.  It would be easy to get lost in the details of these political discussions.  However, it is more than that.  These "high profile" people are shown as being as evil as the people they are discussing, and they are doing more damage to the world then the people we see on the screen are doing.  The movie takes us to various places in the world.  One of these places is a nuclear test site.  There are no cars, not even school buses.  We see the effects of radiation on animals and people.  Many are shown with radiation poisoning.  Another place is in a small town where the townspeople have been subjected to a nuclear power plant explosion.  For those who love science fiction, this is a good film.  I have seen plenty of nuclear film in the past, but I never have seen a film that was so well made.

I am really not sure that the writers got to know Clark all that well or how much was done to flesh the character out, but the movie did an excellent job of making him as realistic as possible.      I was truly moved by the final scene.  And even though the plot is predictable, it does a good job of keeping the viewer/reader interested.  This is a superb movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a nutshell: In the world of the 1980's, a young man named William Bell is the last survivor of a nuclear disaster at a nuclear power station and has been sent to the Institute to be experimented on. At the Institute, the government has sent a man named George to monitor Bell's progress, but when Bell realizes that George is also in a similar experiment, he starts to get more and more suspicious about George, so he decides to break into the Institute and kill the others who are in a room which has been sealed off from the outside world. I found the pacing in this movie very good. There is quite a bit of dialogue and the characters all come across very human and very well developed. There's a scene at one point where William realizes that the only one who's happy about everything is George, who is also the sole remaining male member of the institute. There was also a scene that I liked because the young lady who was Bell's lover (who we don't hear much about) gets tortured by one of the other subjects before being killed. It's not much, but I like it. The way William was set up felt a little like the Terminator, only without the humor and with more gore. But the acting was excellent. It could get a little repetitive at certain points, but it was still an interesting movie to watch, even if I could only stand to watch it a few more times in order to see the ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "In the future it will be known as the year of the robot."   The future that they're referring to is the year 2035, where humans have been left behind by a technologically superior race known as The Replicants. This film depicts the events that occurred during this year where humans were forced to live amongst an advanced society called the Matrix and were not only kept in constant surveillance. What we're shown in this film is a society that not only makes it seem like humans are incapable of understanding the Matrix's many strange aspects (the Matrix is actually a computer designed by humans), but also that humans are not even capable of surviving in a reality that's so alien. It shows how human beings can be manipulated, and how they can be made to do things like eat the flesh off dead bodies, and they can even be programmed to be the perfect killing machine.    And with that, let me say one thing about the film. It was so great, and it's so sad that there hasn't been a film like it since. If you don't believe me, just take a look at this:

It is about an American soldier who is sent to Russia for a special assignment: to find out what happened to a Russian girl and why a lot of Russians hate her and are even willing to give their lives to get her back. He gets to know her very well and the relationship develops. She is the daughter of a wealthy and powerful nobleman and the two have a very intimate relationship. She's an extremely beautiful woman who's very good at dancing. She also has a great sense of humor. She loves her friends and they all come over to her house for a party.  I don't know that she's a very good dancer but she does play the violin and is a bit of a poet, so she seems to have a bit more fun than most.    One of the reasons I like this movie is that it is so beautiful. It really takes you out of yourself. When the Russian girl leaves, it really makes you want to feel like you're in an art movie. It would be very hard to make this movie today with the state of the world, but it wouldn't be nearly so beautiful or thought-provoking. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favorite movie ever!    The story revolves around a high school boy who is trying to make a name for himself after getting kicked out of the Boy Scouts. He goes to the beach with his buddies to see some surfers and gets thrown out. His mother (Dana DeArmond) finds him at the beach, calls him and asks him to come home. She thinks that maybe his grandfather is out of work or something and that his grandfather sent him to the Beach because of the harsh weather, or something like that.   His father, Don (Joe Pesci), doesn't show up at all.  The only evidence we have that he's even alive is the letter that Don wrote Don telling him not to let him go back to the Boy Scout camp.  Don's mom (Patricia Tallman) asks him if he knows where the Beach is.  She tells him the story of the scoutmaster (Peter Falk) who was killed by the surfers. Don then decides to get his own tattoo.  When she goes to get Don's tattoo, he tells her that it is a lie that he didn't know where the beach was.  He tells her how he was there when the surf broke. He says that he went to look for his wife who was hiding in a cave.  But that is all we get from Don.  So then his mom goes to take Don home.  We then get a flashback in the house where Don and his wife get married.     This movie is a classic.  It had the elements to make for a good comedy.  With Joe Pesci as Don who did a great job in every single scene in the movie.  Peter Falk as the scout master who is the main cause of the movie's story.  And then there is Dana DeArn as Dana.  Dana is the sweet little girl who comes up with the idea to go to the Surfers Paradise.  Her mother, Mary (Bette Davis) and her father (Frank Langella) are also in the film.   She makes friends with one of the surf club guys.  While at the Surf Paradise, she runs into Don (Pesci), who is in a bikini.  Of course Dana is attracted to him.  Unfortunately, their relationship is not really that great.  After all, she is still not ready to make the big move to become Don's wife.  I thought that the movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen the "Alien" trilogy (or "Aliens", I don't know), and I've had to watch it at least a dozen times since I was a kid, and I think it's the scariest movie I have ever seen. It was scary for a long time. It still is.   What made this movie so scary for me as a kid was the way the movie went on and on. I guess I'm a child who has a little too much patience to sit through something like this for that long. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always been a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy by George Lucas. So it was pretty shocking and disappointing when I found out in my mid-teens that George Lucas would not be continuing the Star Wars franchise after Episode IV: A New Hope (which I watched in its entirety at age 14).   However, I wasn't really upset about the news: after the first movie (released in 1977) I had already discovered several of my favorite actors (John Lithgow, Christopher Lee, Lee Marvin, Peter Cushing, and James Earl Jones) and was ready to take my place among the ranks of Star Wars fans in terms of my fandom.   But the first sequel (released two years later), Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hire, was an instant classic for a host of reasons, not the least of which is its amazing visual effects (which are still breathtaking in 2013).  The film's third and final entry into the series, A New Dawn (1988), also had great visual effects and was also a classic.  Star Wars is still my favorite space epic by far. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first half (or so) of this was pretty good, but then the bad part kicks in and makes it all seem pretty bad. The film starts with an alien abduction, and the alien is brought to a house where a family, who are aliens (the aliens are the only real bad thing about this film), are living. It is quite a funny movie. The two aliens are not very good at it at all, and their aliens are all very weird. I would have been a little skeptical of a film like this, but I loved it. It was a strange and creepy film, and I don't think anything has a good ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What a fantastic film. It is a classic American Western in the style of the old movies with lots of action and suspense. The film is very well done with a strong lead performance. The cast of the film are well balanced from the different characters. For example: Sam Taylor-Johnson who plays Tom "Black Bart" Bartlett is so good in this film that in my opinion he is the best Western actor of the last 50 years. I also recommend Sam as the leading man for this film but there are also a number of excellent supporting roles. This is a great film and one that should be watched by everyone who loves Westerns.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is the best movie ever made. It is a unique mix of comedy and drama with a few science-fiction touches as well. I could not get enough of it. The story line is good, as is the acting, the special effects, and of course, the music. I think that this movie will be a movie that will last forever.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an unusual, entertaining, and insightful movie. It is a film about a man who is a victim of the "modern age," a "crisis of the soul" that has brought an unprecedented amount of disorder to society, including our culture as a whole. The man is a lawyer, "a man with a lot of good sense," who is so afflicted by the "crises" of the modern age that he decides to become the "fixer" in an office full of the strange people he encounters. His chief problem, however, is how to balance his personal life with this new role he's being given. In this movie, it's a very personal film about an individual who goes to extremes for a reason and doesn't consider them "extreme" when necessary. It's a comedy of manners about a modern man. The acting is excellent, and the comedy is funny, and it also has a good heart. It has some heart too. It seems to have a good touch of irony, but it does it without a hint of self-pity. The film's premise is a lot like a good horror movie in that it puts the audience through a lot. But it takes its time in doing so, and in its way, it makes for a nice night's entertainment. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'd been wanting to see this film for a very long time.   I'd heard a good amount of good things about it since it was first listed on DVD and it had my attention.  If you like your vampires to be a little less campy and a bit more   dark and gritty than most of your recent horror films,   then   get this   film  .   It doesn't have much gore or blood, but it's not really a vampire film at all. It is much more about the family members that make up the household of the dead vampire, all of whom are played by a really nice cast.  The acting is really solid and they seem to be having a good time portraying the family dynamics and trying to out-do one another in terms of the amount of craziness.  They even have a cameo by an   actress I recognize from   other films I've seen.  This movie is a bit of a mess in that the director decided to try and make this into a more serious movie when really it's just a fun romp.  I don't know why the director chose to do this, but this is what it is: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is hilarious. The first half is basically an extended comedy of errors that will leave you laughing and/or crying. The film is funny and light-hearted and it is funny to think about how much the writers of the comedy movie that is about people who make and fix wigs got wrong!   All these jokes work better when you see them with a different perspective.    I liked the idea behind the wigs too, I like a good yarn, but when it is really done well, it is worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most "realistic" movie from the 80's, with a great storyline that you could easily enjoy.  A lot of people say that this movie is the only one that is a good example of the science fiction genre from the 40's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My brother and I went to see this movie last night at the theater. We went to the theater thinking that a movie of this type would be something out of the 1950's, but the way it goes, this is something that is a lot more modern. I think the acting is very good and the story is definitely worth the cost. We could see in the movie the old way, but they also showed us a way that they want to do their modern art, and I would say that in a way it is a movie that is more modern than a lot of the movies from other countries.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' was a great movie, so of course there were all these re-imagined versions which were awful. The new version is a really terrible movie, and one of the worst, by far.   It was made in 1968 to capitalize off the success of the previous movie, but it just doesn't come out of the bag.  The only redeeming quality is that it was filmed on an IMAX 70mm camera and I'm sure it looks pretty good.  While it doesn't compare to the first movie, it is at least very entertaining and I doubt I could watch it twice.  I am sure some people might find this movie entertaining, but I found it to be boring, stupid, and badly acted.  I actually find this more of a 'How to make a movie with your cousin' sort of movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like this movie a lot! I'm glad they chose this one for the big screen in 1985, with a strong cast and a good script that takes time to grow on you.   You get to learn a lot about life, especially how to cope with being poor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to start with saying that I feel this is the best of the prequels. As a Star Wars fan, the original trilogy has been the cornerstone of my love for the series. The prequel films were just a breath of fresh air and a great way to bring back the characters, the action, the characters and the humor. I've mentioned the humor in the previous paragraph. So I was kind of bummed to not see it again.  What's good about the prequel trilogy is that the trilogy focuses on the relationship between Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa. There is so much to learn about the characters that it is hard to say that this is really the Star Wars trilogy. But it is.  There is a bit of a plot here that does not come until the third film and it is kind of confusing.  As I said before, this is probably the best prequel film and if the last two films were any indication of what is to come, this will be a prequel that you will not want to miss. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie made me think about some pretty basic, but important, things.  I mean, what's a better feeling: to come home to a beautiful woman who just so happens to be a little sister of mine?  And a nice, quiet family dinner with them?  How about having your brother, your sister-in-law and your friend, all together for the first time?   Well, I guess we're about to find out.  (This is probably one of the most well-done comedy/family movies ever made, in my humble opinion.  It has a wonderful, touching, happy ending.   This is also one of my favorite comedies of all time.  In fact, I don't know if I could have a good enough sense of humor to like a lot of comedies, but this one works for me.  The plot:   A poor old man tries to do the right thing.  His neighbors are trying to make him pay for his house.  However, when his wife dies (she was very ill), he has nowhere to go and so he goes into the closet and gets a shotgun.  He takes some of the money he needs from his pension so he can buy this shotgun.    The first time we see him with the gun, he's in his office at home.  Then, we go to the first scene: The closet, the dinner.  There's a very nice scene in the closet where a man (who looks like his brother, but obviously isn't) goes into a room and gets ready for bed.  You might be thinking that he looks very nice in this scene.  Yes, that is true.  But is he really?  Well... it doesn't make any difference to the plot in any way.  Because, again, all we see is him getting ready to go to bed.   This is the way he always goes to bed in the movie, the only way he seems to go about it.  Sure, he has his gun, but it's not used.  We only see his hands holding the gun.   Well...  But he doesn't do anything stupid. He doesn't take anything from the table, he doesn-t try to force his way in through the window, he just sits back and enjoys the dinner without taking any food from the cupboard, and then we finally get to see him get dressed.  Once again, he never

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you can't handle good cinema, just close this window. It's an excellent, and somewhat subtle, thriller about a young woman who wants to be a writer, but is instead dragged into a dark underworld, where her lover (played by Jean-Claude Forest) murders people and leaves them in the woods and, in one particularly memorable scene, finds an empty chair in the middle of a bed of leaves in the forest and sits on it. The climax is a really interesting one, with the woman discovering that she's not really a writer at all, and that her "work" was only a charade, as her lover, who'd been playing her for years, eventually escapes with a huge sum of money. A rather dark film, but one which is really, really well done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "Manhattan Project" is a documentary about an American team that worked on the first atomic bomb, and how it worked. The film follows the work of some of the scientists and engineers during the period where they were developing an atomic bomb. There is a nice mix of real science and fiction in this film. For instance, one of the physicists was talking about the "death ray" which, he stated, would "kill all the trees". So much for tree hugging.  My only complaint about the film is that the movie is all about the scientists, so there's little time given to the work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For a short film, Bury Your Dead is definitely a worthy addition to the list of horror movies on youtube, and one of the best short films you'll find online.  The film takes place in a small town in Canada, and shows how the local townspeople try to cope with the death of a young girl.  It's a very short movie, showing how the town is affected by the death.    A lot of people have made comparisons to the original Poltergeist film, which is a very good movie in itself.  If you liked Poltergeister and like short films then this is a must watch!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is quite possible that we've seen all there is to see in this film. It is not the best movie about the civil war, but it is certainly a fine piece. If you are a fan of war movies, then you owe it to yourself to watch this one. The action is all done with the actors in their best gear, so it won't be much of a struggle for you to watch. It has no bad acting in it, which is a feat. It takes place in three different theaters, so the replayability is high. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like a good plot.   This plot has the potential to be a classic.  What are the odds that a group of young soldiers on an overseas trip find themselves in a strange, strange situation when their plane crashes in the middle of nowhere in the Himalayan Mountains? The film is based on a real event and is set in the year 1989.  The action happens when the group is driving along an unlit road with a broken down automobile.  When they run into a village they discover it is inhabited by a small group of people led by a monk.  For reasons that are never explained, the monks don't want to kill any of the tourists.  I found myself wondering who these people could be that are living in this strange place.  A small girl and her father are the only residents in the village and they are shown to be really interesting.  One of the monks tells the kids to clean up the car and that they are lucky to even be in the place at all.  As the action occurs we learn that the monks want to keep the tourists and the villagers in the same situation and that this group of soldiers is a secret weapon that can be used to keep everyone in check.  This movie is a real treat.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The cast are fine as they are all great actors and all do an excellent job. One of the funniest parts in the movie is when all the actors are playing the same part (a "dime store elf") and it's a good time. The one bad scene is when the female elf gets "hacked." It makes you wonder what sort of crap movies are being made in the 1930's when they made this film. If this wasn't a Christmas movie then it would be a bad movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last three years of the '90s were a time for Hollywood to step its ugly, unkempt heels and try something new. It didn't take long for a new direction to be taken in the world of science fiction television.   In 1995, J.J. Abrams' (who had created Lost, Alias, and Alias Again) took up the reins and put an end to the Star Trek era by creating a TV show that featured human clones with the ability to time travel.  Star Trek: The Next Generation  was a good series with a strong core cast of character actors and was well produced, but it didn't stand up to the rest of the Star trek franchise.  A few years later, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country  would return the franchise to its roots with a plot that was an homage to Star trek I and II and Star Trek IV while adding a few new elements: alien races and new characters.  It's hard to put Star Trek  on a more positive note: it was a well-written, well-produced, well acted and entertaining series. It had all the necessary elements: an engaging, imaginative and enjoyable script, good acting and a decent, if not very original concept.  And the cast?  It was a solid one that was strong with Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner, Jonathan Frakes, Gates McFadden, LeVar Burton, Robert Picardo, Levar Burton, Walter Koenig, Jonathan Crisp, Leena Kroft, Jonathan Banks, Brent D. Weathersely, Peter Weller, Brent Dooley, Brannon Braga, Michael Dorn, Nichelle Nichols, Marina Sirtis, Ricardo Montalban, Gates, Scott Bakula, Leonard Nimoy and the late Leonard Nimoys' son.    So is that it?   Yes.  But it was the writing, acting, and direction that were the star performers.  This wasn't just a great TV show; it was an exciting sci fi series with great direction, a great story, excellent performances and the presence of many Trek and Star Wars alumni. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie about a year ago, and I liked it, and if you are a fan of Borscht Belt films, you will like it too.   The Borsch film follows the story of a group of guys who have been on the Borscha Belt for some time now.  This is the story they have been told of how to get started as a belt performer on the big screen.  It is told that there are many "bad" films made about the B.B. (Bad Belt).  This film shows the whole of the B-B.  There are "bad-asses" like the "Red Baron" and the "Borax Bomb,"  but most of the "good-guy" type are bad... or so I hear.  They are not the "redneck" type.  One thing that I like about this movie is that the story is told with a lot of humor... and this is in my opinion, a very good comedy movie!  If you think about the character, and the movies he has been in... he could be a B.D.D...

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very dark movie that is not for the faint of heart.   The storyline is very simple, which is not a bad thing, but it does not help to keep one in suspense.  The acting is fine.  There are a couple of very poor special effects.  I would prefer to see this movie at night, or even in a dimly lit theatre. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't know if this is the best movie made by the great Roger Corman (he also made the great movie Road Warriors ).   In a few minutes you get to see an old friend.   The film is called Itchy and Scratchy Man (1964).   It is a very odd movie.  It has a title, a cast, a title card, it has a plot, characters, and it even has a lot of sound effects.  The movie begins as a simple gag where a cat scratches its leg and then the cat goes down to where a rat has been living in a jar for many years.  When it is told this the audience is taken back into the story and the cat has been scratched and killed but he gets up and is never seen again.  This is the second part of a two parter. In the first part ( the famous "The Tender Trap") a cat is captured by a man who is trying to catch one of the cats that he owns.  There are a lot more strange stories in this part but they don't come into focus until the last reel and they are mostly unimportant.  At one point the man throws a rat in front of a cat and it bites it.  Then there is a lot else in here that the story is about a cat who is a big, beautiful cat but he has a habit of eating food which is made out of wood or clay.  That was the most bizarre thing in this movie. I think that the movie would have been more entertaining if he just kept cutting up the movies.  To me there is no logic to it at all.  I have never seen anyone scratch his leg with a cat in all my life.  All I got out of this movie is that some cat lived with the family for many months and ate a lot so you know the cat died but the family keeps the body on the farm because its so tasty that if you get rid of it the family will starve to death. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to confess I was slightly apprehensive when it came to the adaptation of Stephen King's It. While I enjoyed the movie as a kid (it's a brilliant, funny, scary, gory, creepy, terrifying, brilliant, creepy story), it's not all that surprising that an adaptation would be a bit of a challenge. King's original novel is a lot grimmer and less sweet than many of the movies made from it (and a lot more cynical). But it's a novel of horror, horror movies, and horror novels. I'm a sucker for the supernatural, and it's often hard to find a good adaptation of the original story. This is one of them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very entertaining action thriller set in the early 1950's, the movie is set in a small rural town on the border of Wisconsin and Illinois. The story is set at the time of the infamous "Junkie Bomber" case. The FBI is running a campaign against this crime, and the "Jerk", as he is known in the community, takes full advantage of the publicity. The result is that a man gets killed, and many more are injured. A local sheriff is the first man to investigate the case, and while he does little more than point out the obvious, the general opinion in town is that he is a "lunatic". In the town of Elburn, an old woman who is well-known for curing "nervous women" is taken off to an isolated place where she is put under close medical observation. There she gets help from a "cure-man" who turns out to be the only person who really understands her.   The plot may be simple, but the film has plenty of action and suspense. It is a bit predictable, but it is a very entertaining thriller with terrific performances and a plot that you can enjoy without getting too much of a thrill.  A good movie for a Friday night.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A nice, happy ending to a great movie. Not the most intelligent film, but it is funny, happy and very well-shot. It makes you smile and laugh out loud a few times as the characters interact with each other and do everything the viewer can think of and then, they have to make their way back to the house, and it's all rather silly and awkward, but at the end of the day it still makes you laugh and feel a bit like a kid again. One that doesn't need a new story to keep it fresh for all ages.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a decent horror movie that is not the kind that will really disturb you. This is not a scary movie but it will make you feel an eerie feeling like "something is happening here" but what's happening is a very good old fashioned mystery. And while there is a few disturbing scenes there is also a very convincing atmosphere. The ending is also quite creepy. I am not sure how this movie will end. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun little movie. If I'm going to see a movie about a bear, I'm glad they chose him to be played by an actual bear. The humor is light and the bear is not afraid to break out the humor, and it keeps the audience entertained for a long while.

I like all the characters: the little boy that is a little girl is so cute and a great father. And the mom that is the most beautiful woman in the world. I liked that it was set in New York City. That is why I chose to see it. I think it is a perfect movie that will never be made again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Took me awhile to get around to watching this one, but once I did, I had to applaud the filmmakers for a really decent horror comedy.  Not your father's slasher, but more of a slasher who's got a thing for dancing.  I don't know about you, but I'd like to see more of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought that "Olympus Has Fallen" would not only be funny but also very suspenseful as the protagonist's plan to rescue his wife from the clutches of the terrorists would certainly work at first.   However, this film is all over the place.  First of all, the plot of the film, with such big twists, would make a good thriller. But this film, as far as I can see, is only about an amateur actor, played by Kevin Spacey (who plays a much bigger role in the second part of the series, "The US vs. Russia").   Then we have our villain played by Russell Crowe, also an amateur.  I have not read enough books about the plot to be able to comment much on this film.  Then there are the terrorists and the rescue team, which seem so similar.  Why does this film work at all?  I don't know.  And I have to say, I found it very hard to concentrate.  So maybe the plot is not as good as I thought it was.  But I still enjoyed the movie.  It was fun watching this film again, just because of the suspense and the comedy.  As a matter of fact, this is one of the funniest films I have seen so far. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you have not seen this movie, you must go watch it now! It is good!! I don't know what it is about this movie but it is just a really great movie.

I just love watching the film and I have already had to wait to see it again because it is a great movie and you just don't see many movies like that. I have seen the movie about 5 times and I can not find anything that is not great about it. This movie is also in the documentary category. I thought it was a good documentary and I thought about giving it 5 stars but since I love it so much, I am giving it 4 stars and if you love good movies as much as me, you would love this as much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'll try to explain why I love this film and why it is so good. The movie starts with a man in a wheelchair walking along the street. Suddenly he's met by a beautiful girl who helps him along, and so on. It's not a great movie, but it is a wonderful one. The actors, including the lead, are great. The plot is a bit odd and takes an interesting twist at the end. I haven't seen the book by the same title, but I've read about it, and it's pretty good.    Summary:  This was a brilliant movie in my opinion. It took the best of horror and comedy in a single film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good Wife will go down as one of the greatest TV series of all time. Even though it was a hit, it was not a blockbuster, and despite the bad reviews, I'm really glad I watched it.  My wife, my kids and I have gone back and re-watched it several times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a surprise how good this movie was. I'm sure we've all heard this movie somewhere before. It's one of those movies which seems to have been made over and over.   You might've heard the film   on TV and thought "I don't think I've heard that one before." Well, it does look like a cheap-looking movie.  If it's a horror film, then it's not really a bad horror movie. The scares are fairly tame.  The only one that really impressed me was the very last "paint on canvas" scene. It was scary.  I found it hard to understand why no one from the movie company bothered to actually make a decent soundtrack for this one.  While the film is not particularly bad, there are a few things which could have been better.  I'm not sure if they were just making this film for the radio, or they were simply just not trying very hard.  In any case, this is still a pretty good horror film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen a movie quite this good since the 70's.  Catherine Hardwicke plays a character that seems almost human at the start.  She is very sensitive but it never appears that she is suffering from depression.  Her brother (William Hurt) is the first to have a psychotic break but in real life it is Catherine who is the subject of most of the mental examinations.  In one scene I was almost afraid of Catherine when she was screaming in a public street.  Even when the police are called there is a certain detachment from her.  It is as though the audience is not so sure that we are watching a person.  What is remarkable is the fact that most of her actions, both mental and physical, have a purpose.  This is especially the case with the psychiatrist who has a close relationship to the main character.  He appears to be a kind of spiritual guru.  The ending of the movie may not seem very dramatic but it does not seem to have much purpose other than to make us feel sad about the situation.   (My rating of the film: 7 out of 10)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only thing that might ever be truly offensive about this movie is the name.  It's actually an apt name when you're talking about a movie in which, despite being a little silly, there are moments of truly great artistry.  This is an old-fashioned little tale about a group of girls from different backgrounds who meet at a small school.  The movie is based on a French story that the kids remember from kindergarten.  It's a nice, simple tale of a girl who is being chased by a bully.   In this version, the bully happens to be a boy.  A girl from a pretty poor, working class family ends up at this school and she has very few friends.  She ends up befriending a boy who's father is a teacher.  Although the movie seems quite silly, the performances from the girls are perfectly natural.  Each girl can be quite funny in a scene and there's a moment where all three are laughing hysterically.  There are a few really nice shots in the movie that also manage to capture the style and atmosphere of the time period.  Even though the movie isn't a classic, it's a very good movie to show how the French girls of the 1940s and 50s could be so funny.  For children, this film is a good film to watch because of its good songs that are catchy and colorful.  At least we've got a good ending to the story, which is much more powerful than the ending to a fairy tale.  My only complaint about the film is that, although it is set in France, it is not French.  If this movie was set in the 1940's and you were in a French family that had a French language teacher, you would have no problem understanding the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot of this movie is nothing special, and although it's not bad (although I never really have anything against horror movies), there is no real reason for me to watch it. I don't know that the film is necessarily a bad one, although it is nothing great, but that's not really my main concern with this film, although this is really the only thing I thought about. If you don't like horror movies, and also if you're not sure if this one is actually any good, then definitely skip it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this film! It was well written and made better by the performances of the cast. You never feel like a movie is boring, as you are being treated to a great film by a top-notch director who takes a very simple storyline and turns it into one of the most enjoyable films in recent memory. I can't think of another film I've ever seen with a lead that can pull off such a fantastic performance as Michael Peña; his performance really sells the film, and is the best in the series of these films. I didn't get much of an idea of why we should be scared by a man who turns out to be the Devil himself, so it is nice to see the film come full circle to a good, but not spectacular movie.   Linda Blair's "Revenge of the Devil" was released in 1971 and follows the adventures of a group of women who, upon learning that their new neighbor is Satan (actually just a man that is disguised as a devil), are forced to investigate their new home...

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is not as scary as some of those other scary movie made in Hollywood, it's pretty scary but not as real as some other scary movies out there, but it's a great thriller, that's why we like it, it looks scary but doesn't feel scary.   I hope it can do more for movies like this to make them popular and watch more often. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an excellent movie! The movie is set in a small, working class neighborhood where there are a few kids (about 8) playing with a little car, when all of a sudden...well, I don't really know what happens, but you see the little kid who happens to be on the side of a road (and also, there is a dead body lying by the roadside) and he sees something that he's never seen before...it looks just like him...so of course, he takes a look at his face and...oh man! This is the best movie I have ever seen!!   - March 14, 2007Great Movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie is what a good story is all about.  With a great script, a good director (George Nolfi), and a great star turn for Clark Gable, this movie was a great Hollywood movie of the time.  If you were a young boy in 1932 and were a little troubled, a little afraid, a bit confused and perhaps a bit overwhelmed, then look no further.  I was and am still a big fan of Clark Gables.  His movies were fun, fun, great fun to watch.  This one was not just a "good movie", it was a "Hollywood classic".    (You can buy a copy of this movie at Amazon.com )
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this film and really enjoyed the performance of the actors. I found it to be a more realistic and human portrayal of being a teenager than some of the other films I have seen with teenagers but with all the teenagers. It is not a bad movie per say, but a good, realistic, realistic portrayal and is a very good movie. The only complaint I have with it, is that at certain points of the story when you hear one of the characters talking about how their parents would never let them out of the house, you think to yourself well that is just great in the movies that are always about teenagers. I mean why would they let their kid out of there for anything. That is the one problem I had with it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so amazed to read this movie about a Jewish family and their adventures in America in the 1920s - it was wonderful, especially since it was a picture in color. The actors and the director worked very well to create such a picture, which also showed great talent in the people involved, a talented and intelligent director, and talented actors. I am sure that it will have a long life as a movie, just as a good book and a good novel. I think that it is the film which has the most charm, and which has done most to attract people to see it, and the picture itself is very entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great mix of action and comedy in this one, with a great villain.   What more can you ask for?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When a movie tries to be too much, too fast, too loud and too dumb, it can be really hard to watch.  Even though this is a bad movie that I have seen many times, I still had to give it a try since I know for a fact it is supposed to be good.  There is a lot of action and lots of dumbness.  I think I will be watching a bad action movie until I die since there is no rhyme or reason for the actions these people are taking.  This is another reason I cannot say I love the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a great one.  It is a realistic story about the American war in World War I in which the American soldiers are fighting the German Wehrmacht.    And it is very well done and I enjoyed the movie.  The acting is good and the scenes are well done.  You can tell that the crew was extremely tight-knit.  And the music is great.  I recommend this movie to anyone who has a passing interest in World history or who has not seen a movie like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the hands of director James Mangold (who's never had an easy time making "serious" movies) this is a movie about the aftermath of some great football teams' greatness. The film follows the lives of players from teams who were so good that their games were played on the front lawns of their home towns. I found myself rooting for them all as their personal, romantic life stories were very interesting. The only down side to this movie is the music (which I admit was really catchy). The ending was a little too abrupt and a little predictable, but I like the film a lot nonetheless. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed it    This movie is just another excellent example of the way the Japanese film industry operates: by taking great advantage of what the Americans call a "foreign" audience. This movie, directed by Makoto Shinkai and starring the adorable teenage pop sensation Haruka Tomatsu as the heroine, is just about as good as he is (I don't know if that's a compliment or a criticism). Tomatsu does her thing pretty much flawlessly, but she's really there as a way to make this film more accessible to a wider audience, with the same amount of screen time that she gets. Shink.ai plays with different themes in this film, and sometimes he does a very good job. Some of his best work comes when he's playing with the idea of the "other side," of what it might be like if you went to the zoo and watched the monkeys instead of the penguins. But it all comes down to the brilliant performance of the young actress, and the wonderful music. As for the story, it's quite short, although the story seems to be getting longer as you go. It's about a young boy who, after he's done his math homework, gets a phone call that there's an earthquake in his town. It turns out that a little girl has been kidnapped, and is taken to an all-female school where she's kept in a closet in the basement. We follow her as she struggles through this school in an attempt to get back to her family, and her parents, and finally finds her way out of the school and back to the family home. It is beautifully written, and I really like the idea that the whole concept of "the other side" is such a basic element of everyday life that is constantly being ignored by the young people of today.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A funny movie with a good storyline.   I do not see any reason to explain what a vampire is.  I can say that it is something from a horror film where the characters go into a house. It is not something that is very frightening or scary.  A good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's nothing more satisfying than seeing a talented young actor give his best performance in a film. And then it's over, or so the story goes. The movie, however, is very much a good, albeit derivative, film that is well worth seeing just for the performance of Daniel Radcliffe. The film has a pretty standard and fairly standard story of what happens when a couple go to get their picture taken (and it would have been even worse if they were not there to record it on a video tape). But then, the camera turns in a 180° and there's a small girl (Jessica Alba) running across a field, the wind blowing her hair like the petals of a rose. This girl, which looks like a small little girl in her little pink dress and little white tights and little hat with a heart shaped crown on top, runs across the field, and we are then shown the little girl running all across a picture of a flower. This little girl runs across this picture of that small flower and we get a view of the rose petals and of a small flower, which then turns into a picture, and the picture morphs into a giant mannequin. This giant man is that girl (or rather, is that the boy), and we see a picture which morphs to a giant arm which reaches down and picks up the flower that she is running across and which we then see turn into a man in a dress and tie. This man is called James Potter, and he has a big blue rose, and it says: "A Rose By Any Other Name". Well, this movie is just pretty good, and even if it weren't about a tiny girl running around a field and then transforming into a large man with a big green rose on his arm, it'd be just as good. A pretty good one too. I know the cast is pretty much all over the place here, but they have a good time together as well. So that's it. Not a bad little movie at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is definitely a good one, and as a film that takes place in a war zone, it is extremely realistic, not to mention realistic for the period. I would say that the film is more focused on the characters of the various soldiers, rather than the actual war; however, this is a good thing. The characters and plot, even though slightly simplistic, are very realistic. I enjoyed it very much, and would recommend it to anyone in the mood for a good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't think I've seen an American-made movie that has captured the imagination of anyone who is not either old or rich.  And it doesn't hurt that it has a fantastic soundtrack by the likes of Elton John, a wonderful performance by Tom Hanks, and a movie that can only be described as "American classic."  This is, in many ways, a more exciting and sophisticated version of  The Wizard of Oz  than anything the 1939 version has to offer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't remember this being so good on a first viewing; I can remember only two parts: a young man is given a job as a bus boy at the movies and is given the worst script imaginable; a woman comes to the rescue of the young man, and it was well done, but I was hoping for something more. I guess it's not possible, but if you like the film, and you like a good script in a low budget, low-budget film with one of the better musical numbers out there, I'd suggest it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What can I say. A perfect blend of comedy and drama, set in modern day America, and featuring the most realistic depiction ever of a drug-fiend.  The film's main character is a former American soldier whose wife is a nurse who becomes a drug addict when she begins to have a baby on the job. She turns to crack cocaine (at least that's what the doctor calls it) and is soon a junkie. The other characters are all addicts; the wife is the most interesting (at first) since she is now a mother.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first film in a "New" Trilogy about the life and times of Captain William McVay (I was always a fan of his and thought he looked like an old time sailor). It starts out looking like a typical "Western" but then it hits you that this is something special. A very realistic account of the life of a man who has to be one of the hardest working men in all the British Navy to keep his ship afloat. His stories of life aboard the ship were almost unbelievable. For a ship of that size, it seemed to me that its speed was rather low and that he had to work out a slow and sure cruise at a speed of only about 25 knots. I thought at first that this was a case of a young man with a great future ahead of him but then I thought of how many other such young men that are given a free pass by their senior officers to get a better paying job. A young man who is as strong as a bear and yet he finds it hard to find work in the private sector. I think at one time or another I have seen about twenty such people but I have found out that most of them have the exact same story. They seem to want to be officers and if they have to work on a ship that is that big, its a wonder that any of them ever get through it with any ship or man. A case in point was a young fellow by the name of Captain Edward E. Wilson. He was an excellent officer, with the most outstanding ship and men. He could run a ship. He wanted to be the best, but he found he could not. Captain Wilson was very sensitive about his service and had been fighting for many years to keep it in the service but it seemed that it was too good an opportunity for his wife to pass. So in about the same time that Captain Wilson retired, the navy decided to retire him from the Navy, since he had proved his worth, so it was very sad. But the next generation of officers who went after Captain Wilson had better luck with him. Their wives were a great help to them and they became very successful. The only one who failed in his assignment was a man named Captain William H. F. McRae. Mc-Rae was a very strong looking man in his mid fifties with a large broad nose, but an easy going disposition and a quiet demeanour, as well as very effective on the battlefield. After a number of
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw this movie I almost immediately thought, "Oh, I don't need to look at this movie more than once. It's all over the place and very boring." But I was wrong. I'd be lying if I told you that I never laughed out loud while watching this movie. In fact, I laughed out LOUDLY while watching it. It may not be one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen, but it certainly has something that'll make you smile and laugh, and that's the good ol' "We'll be back!"
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, if you're looking for a good time, look no further than this one. The story is an absolutely delightful one: a woman named Annie meets a man named Peter who is also a woman, only not a woman who wants to become a woman. The idea, as stated by the author, is to try to find a way to create a new life for herself. That life, we assume, will include being a woman that likes being a little bit gay. The result is very strange, as you might expect: it's not really all that good, but a few minutes at the end make it a fairly worthwhile experience. This is a "funny" comic, and you may think it's bad, but this is a comic where the humor comes from a rather silly premise. The best jokes are ones that don't even get in, and one of the most entertaining parts of this comic are the "adventures" Annie has with the "possessed" man. The premise was a nice idea, and the comic had some pretty funny moments. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite work out and doesn't bring anything new to the table.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't normally like any kind of horror, but this one is pretty good. It is pretty much like it's older brother, the earlier The Exorcist.

I am afraid to say that you will not be able to find it in most of the video stores because it has a limited release.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie, and I'll admit to being pretty darn happy about the fact that I now have to sit through a new Star Trek movie every damn year.   I have seen the original Star Trek   from the 1960's and it's one of my favorite TV shows.  And this is the same show that I grew up loving.  The good thing about this new Star Wars   movie is that it looks pretty damn good.  With that said, I found the special effects to be very poor.  I found myself laughing a lot more than I thought I would (I mean who laughs at a computer and a flying saucer?)  It was a bit annoying how the movie kept using the same Star Wars: Episode 3 set over and over again.  Now, I'm not saying it wasn't fun or all that spectacular, I just felt like it wasn in the same category as the "I Love Lucy" show.  My review on the Star Wars movie: The Movie:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The worst kind of comedy that never gets good.  The story is silly, the plot is a mess and the characters are awful. The actor (Tom Cruise) is horrible and the plot has little to do with any real place.  If the movie doesn't make you want to die or kill someone you know nothing about movies at all.  I like a good horror movie but it doesn't stand up to some of the other movies that have been released this year.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was just in the right place at the right time when that movie was playing.   It was such a different story from anything I had seen.  It reminded me a lot of " The Three Stooges " where the stooges are real people, not just funny looking cartoon characters.  What really stands out about the movie is the acting.  The characters were really the first to break the wall of sound.  A number of different characters are used but they are really unique and funny.  They could really use a few more of these guys.  There are so many funny lines and lines of dialog.  I loved it!  I am sure you will too.  Recommended to all.

And for me, that's all you really need to get an Indiana jones movie in your mind.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good and a bad movie. The good part is that the whole scene in the train is filmed very well, which is probably because it was a stunt train shot with stunt doubles. The bad part is just that the movie has not a lot of energy. It is an average romantic comedy, with some very silly humor and a plot that is a bit on the slow side.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of the original "Honeymoon in Vegas," but I found myself with a couple of problems. The first is that the character is not the first in a long line. The character, in her own right is not so great, she is an unsympathetic young actress in a film full of stereotypes.   As for the movie itself:  There are certain points at which a movie becomes unwatchable. I did see this in a movie theater the first time I saw it.  If you are not a fan of classic Hollywood melodrama, then this is not for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those "one of those movies" where everybody knows every line and the entire film has an air of knowingness. If I could have chosen a title for this picture, I would have chosen something like: "The world is full of funny things" "I think I've got an odd idea. I'm thinking I'll give it a go. It seems a little odd to give a blind man a pair of sunglasses and a radio. But I don't see any reason for people to be blind anymore. You see, it's not unusual for people nowadays to wear glasses and I've never really thought about it until now. I didn't see anybody with glasses in the street. Maybe they're rare? Or maybe they're just not fashionable." So begins the introduction to this delightful comedy about two friends on holiday visiting the countryside. One has a little problem with a blind friend and his brother, and the other has some trouble with the police on his road to hell. I find it amazing that a movie so full of the kind of jokes I used to write about in a weekly column now exists, but I guess I am just one of the odd ones. This is certainly one of them.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I know it seems like a silly title, but I couldn't help but love this movie and wish it were a real movie. I was really drawn in by the trailer for this movie which is funny and has great performances, and then I found myself completely sucked into the film itself, despite my lack of knowledge about its plot. I think the reason why I found this movie so compelling was the way the movie handled its plot; it seemed like the plot was a mix of many different genres and the film managed to blend them all together very well. It was also a very well acted and directed movie which managed to make me emotionally invested in the story.

At first I thought, "they are making fun of the computer, why does that matter? Then I realized that it was a way to keep the kids off of the computers (since their parents were so busy that the kids would not be bored at recess) and also to keep them away from the "wizards". The wizard's name was Dr. Doolittle. Anyway, I love this movie and I always think it was one of the best made films in the history of cinema.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a sucker for a good old fashioned Western, so when I read the synopsis, I thought that there was no way in hell I would be watching this movie...and I was not disappointed! This film is a great example of the best of the old school Westerns: the rugged, tough, no bullshit no holds barred type that are all too rare these days. This movie is based on an old story about an outlaw who is forced to go into the mountains to face the lawmen. I was shocked that this movie was made in 1940, and to find it was all set to sound the same as the film I read back in college was just unbelievable. This film had a great score from Mel Tormé that really got me on the wagon to go watch this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first film in the Indiana Jones series had me looking forward to seeing this sequel for years.  My father got me this a few weeks before I started college and we spent about three hours of the movie watching it.  Well, it got me hooked.  This is the type of movie I can't get enough of.   This film isn't an Indiana Jones or a Conan the Barbarian, but rather a mix of adventure, suspense, and comedy.  After having watched the first Indiana Jones film, I knew there had to be something this film had to offer.  The movie begins with the main character trying to rescue his wife from a group of Indians.  Although it appears that the Indians have a way of taking some of his clothes off, Jones manages to rescue the woman.  They get into their jeep, and the three of them try to travel south down the Ohio River to Indiana.  Unfortunately, they find that the river is too high and the jeep can only go so far before the water starts to get in.  Now, there's a little trick to get past the river.  A man (in the picture below) climbs up onto the top of a nearby mountain, then climbs down to where the river flows into the water, taking the water with him.  We then cut back to the jeeping scene.  Jones gets out of the je and sees some men and women playing cards, all of which seem to be quite familiar to him. However, the situation seems to be worsening and they don't seem to have enough rope to tie the people to the top.  Then, we see the river getting higher and Jones tries to climb the mountain back up to the river level, but he doesn't seem too excited about it. However...  Then he gets into a raft and is able to climb back down onto the mountain to get to his wife.  At the end of the story we see an old Indian woman walking up the mountain and then Jones gets off the raft to rescue her.  What a great story, and even better than the first film.  When Jones finally finds the people who have taken off his wife's clothes, it seems like he might finally get them and get off that mountain that is taking up so much of his time.  But then again, they've been following him for a very long time, and this is not a very efficient way to get across the river, nor does it take long before they
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was made for a reason. Not because of a good story. It doesn't have anything bad in it at all. It is made up of well-told stories that are well adapted into the film. I thought the way it was told with very slow, slow motion that actually brought the story to the stage. There isn't much in the movie that is new. It has been done many times. Some times better. And sometimes worse. In this movie we are shown things we don't see every day. I would love to see a movie that tells us about those things that are in our heads. The fact that this movie is made by a man who has worked in film in many countries is evidence of that. I think a movie like this would do well here. If anyone ever does make a movie based on an idea he has, I would like to see it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very nice movie that tells the story of a young man who travels back in time to the day of his baptism and to witness the birth of his father. The movie was very well acted.  It is a good film that is worth your time.  The first thing I will say is that I am not sure if any of the three films (or even the four episodes) of the TV series are necessary. I do enjoy the characters and the setting of the story, and I think that the series did a much better job with the scripts than the TV show was able to do in its first season. I have not had a problem finding the episodes of the series to watch, even in my car.  I enjoyed this series and it made me look forward to season 2 when I finally found it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It takes a lot of patience (at least for a first timer) but once you do finally watch this movie you are glad you did. The story is simple enough: a group of people go to a lake to camp out. A few days later a large storm breaks loose in the area. Everyone is in trouble: the tent is gone, the canoe is gone...you get the idea. They are only three women and one man...it isn't pretty. The first half is a bit slow but eventually gets better. They find a cave, make some campfire and have a good campout. One man, Bill, is the cook. At first he tries hard to impress the women but his attempts never go over very well. He tries to pass the cooking duty to the two girls, one of which is a pretty young girl named Mary. That is about it. You can pick out some of the bad acting from one of the females but these three women are great. There are good performances from all three and the story is fairly interesting. One of the most memorable moments from this movie is when a storm starts up near the end of the film and you think something bad is about to happen. Well it does and it really is scary. Another great feature of this movie are the two dogs that were in the movie originally. Bill's son, Bill Jr., plays the role of a dog in one scene and Bill Sr. plays a dog a few scenes later. The dogs have a fun time together and I don't think they need any other kind of role in the film. If you like your comedy with a dash of horror then this is one that you don't want to miss.

It is set in a future that has been devastated by nuclear war. A survivor, a young boy named John Coffey, is forced into a strange new world. This world is populated by creatures with incredible power and incredible cruelty. But John loves the creature's love of life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Matrix has been one of my most anticipated movies for years. At one point I even started watching the prequels to The Matrix to get a better idea of how they were set up, but even now I still feel like I am trying to understand this movie so much, because I know a lot more than just the beginning. The most important thing to understand is that The Matrix is a spiritual experience, a journey through the realms of thought, love, and fear. It is a movie that is in many ways deeply philosophical but also deeply realistic, with an understanding of the world that is based not on wishful thinking or hope but on the science of neuroscience.    From the very start The Matrix starts to show its limitations. At the time I was not that big of a movie buff. But I always liked the movies of Keanu Reeves in the 80's. The Matrix took the old movies and put a new twist on them. That twist was that there was no real time, it was only a computer that was telling the protagonist (played by Laurence Fishburne) what to do. And his character was not an ordinary person, he was a cyborg. So he couldn't think, he couldn�t have a life outside of the Matrix. Now there were a few movies that did a version of this and the only difference was that the plot was different. The whole Matrix was a simulation, it simulated time, space, and matter. And so to be able to move around the Matrix was not as easy as you might imagine. The first problem is that when you go inside the Matrix your brain starts to malfunction. All that is going on in the Matrix is that your mind is playing a video game. There was no way to move and there was even no way you were really there. The second problem is the way the characters are written. For instance, there is one character who just has enough information for the story to keep going. He has a lot of wisdom and he can see a lot into the future. But since he has the knowledge he uses it for the good. There are a lot things in The Matrix that I could have told you but I decided not to because I thought it might be too boring to write about it. The only thing I am going to point out is that in some of the scenes you see a picture of the sky that looks similar to the night sky in the U.S. in the summer. This is because the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The opening scene takes place in a hospital, where the main character is waiting patiently for a kidney transplant that will enable her to get out of the hospital and get her life back on track. She is then interrupted by a doctor who suggests the possibility of using a drug to make the transplant easier - to which the heroine, being a realist and not one to be taken in by the doctor's guffaws, replies: "Sure, why not? The best is the hope of a better tomorrow." After this short introduction is the first scene of the movie which takes place at the hospital - the hero is there to get her back on her feet. The doctor seems somewhat impressed with the heroine's determination and then asks her whether she knows why she needs a kidney, in which the poor heroine replies:  "Well, as a doctor, my only reason for wanting to have a kidney is to keep my job." The doctor then says: "Well you've got one, but you don't have one to go with it. As you know, one kidney works only when two more are connected up to it. So, you'd better get two." Well that puts the hero back into action, but she does find one thing in her hospital room... a little note from her husband: "Keep in touch with the nurse." (Note: "A little note" may be the most romantic thing the heroine has ever encountered... in fact, it may just be the first thing she ever sees.) Now, the heroine then has to go to the doctor to ask about a transplant. (Note 2: The "totality of the picture" is a bit exaggerated, as it does not really occur until the last few minutes of the film, but I thought it was interesting nonetheless. There are no real characters in this movie - instead, there is only the heroine and the doctor, who are talking about something that is not very important.)  A very odd and somewhat boring movie. I think that is one of the things that make it "good". And, in the end, it is also the thing that keeps the movie from being truly good - there is too much dialogue. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one heck of a movie. The plot was easy to follow and was filled with some great dialogues. One of the most memorable ones was one that said to a man in prison, "You don't believe in Jesus? Why don't you try to get clean and then see for yourself!" The director, Robert Downey Jr. really shines in this movie as a very sympathetic and even emotional character. The rest of the cast, especially John C. Reilly and Kevin Kline are also great. The story takes place in an asylum, so there's a lot of medical detail to consider. There's also some interesting political elements to it as well. Overall I would highly recommend this film for anyone interested in the subject.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen a few good science fiction movies in the last 50 years, but I'd never seen one set in space. I've heard some good things about it (one reviewer even compared it to Close Encounters ). I wasn't expecting anything else from the sci-fi genre and I was glad I went to see it.   The main character (an android) is a bit eccentric. His friends are odd and the other aliens he meets are interesting and sometimes comical. The plot is not very intricate, but it's a good story (which is always the key to a good sci- fi movie).   There are a number of scenes involving alien bodies. As they disintegrate, the body parts move through space.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The worst movie ever made. It was terrible to watch. The film was set in a school for deaf and dumb people. The school itself was set up to teach these people and their parents about how to communicate and listen to one another. It should be obvious that the deaf kids did not do well. These parents were not able to help their children. They did not even know how to be "normal" like those around them. They had a constant lack of knowledge of how to talk to each other. They were unable to use their hearing aids properly. All they could do was to babble out gibberish. They also did not know how normal and polite to be. They would say "I'm sorry" and then act like they were sorry for nothing. The kids also did all they could to be mean and rude. The principal was rude, the deaf teacher was rude and the students were rude and mean. The ending was awful. The parents said they would "go home" and they wouldn't go home. Then the deaf girl turned a trick and the kids found her in bed with the principal. They beat the crap out of her and then they threw the principal out of the window. The "bad guys" did not die, they just left. It got so bad that the principal had to be admitted to the hospital. No other movie ever seemed as bad as this.

I didn't know at the time how deep this rabbit hole went, and I have to admit it is a fun movie, even if the acting isn't up to par.   This one is a comedy about an old man who is forced to take care of his grandson while his grandson is getting married. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't really know how to write about a movie. If you've seen it (and you should) then it's one of those rare gems that seem to be so often recycled. This movie was a big budget Hollywood movie and it looked like you could have taken the plot from one of the movies they have on DVD from the 70's. We get an American movie star who is in Hollywood because she's tired of living in India. She comes to London and is in a relationship with a British man and the English man is trying to get her to sign a contract to become a British actress and he'll pay her in gold. It's interesting that we never see the man being a star, we never get a scene of him with the woman and we never learn of her family. They're just called the Khan and the Khan. Then the story goes that they have a child and we see a picture of the child on the wall and the words "My daughter is not like other children" and that's the end of it. In a way this movie was good because it was a bit of a comedy but it wasn't funny. At the end I was laughing but it was so boring. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I always enjoy the work of Martin Scorsese and this is no exception. I don't know if it's the actor's performance or the writing of the script that has caused Scors a lot of success, but whatever it is, this was a very good movie. I liked it a lot and I'm glad that I can still watch this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have a strong bias towards the British: the best movies I ever watched were the ones where the British were the bad guys: the Brute Force movies, the Dark City. and so on.   What did the French do? They became the bad guy and, like The Brute force, it was good:  Well, a decent movie! The lead, a young woman, has some problems in her life. She has no boyfriend, she's unhappy with the one she's got, she misses her mother, she feels bad about her father. She is the daughter of an army officer who has fallen in love with a French princess.  It's not a terribly interesting story, there aren't really many twists, but it is a good story:  It really is a long movie, but there is a lot of action scenes. The hero is an American, an expert in using the AK and it has a lot more potential than the standard AK.  For a movie that was made about a woman (well, one woman) with no love life to worry about, it did a pretty good job of telling a story.  The French in this film are much less like the French of the 90's and the 50's. I liked the French in the 50s.

John Barrymore was back to play the role which has so impressed us all for over three decades.  This is an excellent piece of work with plenty of great set pieces, excellent acting from all over the place and a very good script, though in a period when no one was interested in the new television series it did not make much of a splash.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I never thought I would find myself saying this, but: Don't make me laugh too hard!  This is the sort of comedy that is not only funny (I was laughing hysterically during the credits, I swear!) but it also has a whole lot of heart in it (though its not very complex - not to say that it doesn't have something to say about some real-world topics - and there was a lot of that in there too).  The cast is terrific, even the really silly ones like the young man on the couch trying to be funny.  We had the usual gang from old films here:    Stanley Kramer in a terrific role, in which he's a dashing, smart, good-natured bad-ass - as he is in real life;   Ira Kaplan playing a great version of Jack Benny.   And the music was very good.  It was actually the first comedy to use a good jazz orchestra.  As usual, the director is an amazing guy.  When I had the chance to interview him, I told him I was writing a book about him.  He told me I was doing such a great job!  He always has a lot to say.  His movies have a real sense of humor; they are very simple, but they make you laugh.  Of course, when he goes into the comedy business, he makes the same mistakes that everybody else does.  But he has such a gift for making movies - I can't imagine he will not be a great star.  I give this one a wonderful rating - a must see! Posted by David N. Schuster at 9:38 AM

This film, like many others, is very realistic and realistic looking.    While it is not as good a movie as the original, it is very good enough to be enjoyable.   It is a fun movie and the actors did a good job.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original Blade Runner was an awesome, creepy science fiction film (a masterpiece, by the way), but director Ridley Scott's follow-up, the more-or-less-sequel Blade Runner, came along just a few years later, and, well, it doesn't look half bad either.  It's not just because it's much prettier than the original; there are more effects in there, especially in the second half, and the story is a lot more interesting.   I was actually looking forward to this sequel, even though I thought it was going to be even more of the same sci-fi silliness.  Of course, Scott had already done a bunch of sci- fi movies by that time (you think I'm kidding, go back and see the original), so the idea of this sequel just seemed like an excuse to play around with the idea that the main characters would become immortal in the 21st century by ingesting a specific type of alien slime.  (And yes, Scott himself has said this is what he was after.  )   But that's not what I really cared about.  This is more than a simple sci- fe flick -- Scott has crafted a wonderful, atmospheric movie that really nails the feeling of Ridley Scott making a horror film.  Blade Runner's central theme is one of time-travel and time-bending, and if that sounds like the premise of an adventure movie, then that is absolutely correct.  The way they show it here is rather disturbing -- the film begins with a shot of a man in a space suit walking to an observation post, which, to be honest, looks a lot like the observation post seen in the original, minus the creepy "time travel" theme.  He then enters what is essentially an elevator-like device, but in the middle of the trip, the elevator goes "BOOM!" and he is blown up by a mysterious blast of green energy (it may very well be green slime).  There is no explanation about how this happened, and it doesn's't really make sense.  There are some clues about it scattered about the futuristic world, but they're really just thrown in, leaving you to figure it all out for yourself.  As you go along with the movie, you slowly come to realize that you are watching an interesting, thought-provoking futuristic horror film, especially considering that it is made in the '80s.  I loved the film, but

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw the first movie about Aang, I thought it would be interesting to get an idea about the life of a Fire Nation boy. In the movie, we get to meet some of the characters and learn some details about their lives in the Fire Nation. There are very few Fire Nation women and their lives were pretty simple. There is Aang who was a pretty young Fire Lord when he died. There was a lot of talk about how Aang was just an ordinary boy. We also find out what happened to Aang's parents. One of the things we learn is that Aang is very strong. He is really a very strong character. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To put it simply, this is a perfect film: the story is interesting, the cinematography is outstanding, and the acting is superb. The best way I can sum it up is to say that it's the perfect movie: everything that it needed to be. For those of you who have not yet seen this film, it's a science fiction film about "The Space Pirates" -- a group of aliens who have come to Earth to conquer it. They arrive by taking up positions in outer space with space ships and then invade Earth using various space weapons and space vehicles (the film is quite humorous about the various ways in which they accomplish this). They use "space guns" (which don't look like a thing that you'd find in outer Space; rather, they appear to be large fireworks) to attack buildings, causing large numbers of people to get killed. When we first see the film, two of the Space Pirates, who are in a spaceship, are watching television and a commercial about the "Space Guns", and it seems as if they don't realize the gravity of the situation. This is a good thing, because once you realize that something is wrong, the film quickly gets to the action: the Space Guns are quickly destroyed (there's a little bit of a jumpy scene in the film when they first come to us) and we see the first alien (we don't see much of the alien, but I was very impressed with its eyes and it was very nice to see this film without the usual cheesy effects). The Space Pirates also decide to come into town to attack. They take several positions outside of town and fire their space guns. However, they are not effective in getting rid of people and they are quickly defeated. However the film also ends on an interesting note: they go outside and look into the sky and find that Earth is being destroyed by some space weapons, and that it is the fault of the aliens, who have decided that Earth should be destroyed. The alien then attacks the Space Ships; however, they manage to destroy one or two of them (although it's quite possible that a Space Ship can go quite fast; however they're not very powerful) and are about to enter Earth; however the alien is hit and falls into space and we are then introduced to our main characters: Captain Tylor (Charles Laughton) and his wife (Eleanor Tomlinson). Tylors' wife is an alien and her powers make her a formidable

The Enterprise had been assigned to a planet where the population was being controlled by a strange race called "Chattos". After the Enterprise left, they followed the ship down to the planet's surface.  With a ship full of crazy-looking guys in blue suits and hats, these guys were controlling all of these inhabitants through some kind of mind control device called the "Charon's Eye".   Just before they were to meet up with the Enterprise, they decided to take a nap to get rid of their "nervousness".  I was just as riveted as everyone else by this movie.  Sure the actors were all very good in this movie but it was the technology of the show that really amazed me.  There are many sci-fi movies made over the past 75 years but none come close to this.

Also the movie has a nice ending, but one that is not too dramatic.  This movie is also very funny, and it has some good one liners.  I found the acting in this movie to be good, and the characters to be well developed.  All in all a really good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always had a love for the early 70s.   They were the first decade of the 80s when the Hollywood blockbusters first emerged.  I never saw " The Goonies " nor " The Lost Boys " but, seeing them on a rerun in 1987, I was sold on the idea that the world was full of wild kids living in a fantastic world, filled with adventure.  As a child watching those movies in the 80's, I always imagined a day when the kid's returned to their hometown after going on an adventure somewhere in the world.  In that sense, " The Dark Crystal " is the second film in the series.  It's a film about the kids who had come back to Earth and the dangers they are up against on their way back to their own world. The film is about a group of young people who have returned home after their adventure and have set about rebuilding their home.  The film opens with them being welcomed to their home, the realm of Eternia.  Their home is under attack by an alien entity and they must race against the clock to repair their home and defend it from its impending demise.  Eternian is the most powerful and advanced planet in the universe, and the planet is on the verge of being destroyed by the evil alien force.  A group of humans led by a young woman named Crystal are able to help Eternians and their home recover and rebuild their world. They can do so because Crystal is a witch.  Crystal is the leader of this group who is also a young witch. Crystal is able to use the magic she learned as a young girl to help others and is seen as a role model for many of the other humans in her group.  One of the human characters is a boy named Jake who has been separated from Crystal and is searching for her.  Jake is a normal boy who wants nothing more than to find his sister but she has disappeared.  Unfortunately for Jake, his search for his sister is going to be one of the most difficult he ever has to endure.  Despite being separated from his sister and being in danger, Jake finds a way to survive by being brave and cunning.  While in Eternium, Jake meets a girl named Mina who he takes on as his apprentice.  Mina is an alien and she is a magician. She has special powers that allow her to get what she needs when she needs it.  On Etern
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie about a man who goes into a store, buys a pack of cards from a clerk and decides to go back and sell them for profit. The movie is very silly and very stupid, with the characters talking about how this game (in a store) is "the big one" (actually, I think it was a game of cards... not a game from a store with the "big one" on the box, obviously). A woman and a man (who plays the manager, and the man tries to take the money out of the register while the woman watches) come out of a building and play some kind of game. It all seems to make very little sense, as do most of the jokes the characters make. I've seen this movie a few times, but I can't remember anything except the scene where the wife asks the man how many times he's played cards, and when he replies "every day", she tells him about their new baby, and then she gets all angry with him and demands an apology. It has an excellent score from me (though it's hard to get the movie listed as a comedy, because it's so bad and the characters are so stupid).

The movie is about an alien that comes to earth and is looking for the aliens that were living in the area. He is accompanied by a man named John Henry Fisichelli who is a magician that looks quite dapper and the movie begins with Fisico in his apartment with his girlfriend and the two of them are talking and fiddling with their magic tricks. When the alien arrives Fisicihelli starts to talk about the aliens and how they are called and are the same aliens that the two men in the hotel were talking about, he tells them that they live underground in caves, and he tells Fisicshelli that they are a very small race that live in these caves and he says the aliens are very strange in that they look like an insect which is just a piece of wood with wings attached. Fisicalhelli says that they have been living on Earth for a very long time and have found themselves in a very hostile area, the aliens don't want anyone to notice that they exist and they don't like to be seen. The aliens have a great love for the human race because the human races do not harm them when they are alive. When they die they are returned to the caves where the two people that were with him in the room with the lights turned off. The alien is shown walking in his underwear to the door to the room in which he and Fiscialhelli are living and Fischelli is there in his place with another man in the same underwear, but this time wearing a coat. After a while Fisi notices that his clothes and the coat have moved and FIsichellii says to him "This is the last time you'll be wearing pants". After a little while Fiscichell i is asked if he is sure to continue living like this. Fiscicchellii replies that since this is the third time in a row now that he has seen an alien, that it is only a matter of time until he sees another one. Fieschellii is sure the aliens will be there in two or three months time. Fischellii asks the alien to take him with him, the alien replies that he can take him right then but asks that he first take off his underwear. After that Fiscailhellii jumps

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've long thought that George and Iggy would be good friends, but now, for the first time, I know it is possible. George brings a unique sense of energy and enthusiasm, while Iggy has a warm, funny spirit. You'd think they'd get along fine but they don't. George is an eccentric prankster and a man of many talents, but is at heart a bit of a madman. Iggy, on the other hand, is a gentle soul who loves the countryside and is just waiting for a good day to come. In the case of George, being an eccentric, prankster, he never expected to have a chance to meet Iggy. George's life is anything but "normal". He was a musician as a child and later was very involved in the local music scene. He was particularly good at playing the accordion. George would often play the accord with a large group of people, including his wife, and would often improvise his own songs and play them while the others watched. For years he had the most popular accordion in the area, but later lost his voice as a result of a long bout of illness. I wonder where he has the accordions now? I wonder who will play the next one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to admit, that despite my fondness of this, I didn't give this a watch. I was never that keen to watch movies based on books. But then, I read a great story and I was excited! So, I picked it up and I really enjoyed it! My only complaints are that I wish the film would have had a little more focus on the female characters and I also wished they could have introduced more than one person who's very much like a young version of me (I was a bit of a snob in those days!) I also really liked the sound! I can't really remember what the words were but what I do remember was the great score and the music of the film. I can still hear the wonderful score as I sit here waiting to finish this review.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is simple: The movie follows the story of a young girl and her family. Her father is the local bar owner, who seems to be a bit of a slouch. She has a pet rat, and a cat in the house. The Rat is the real star, a little chubby one, who lives in a cage on her father's mantle (and in there, under her bed, she has a rat costume). One day she finds out that the cat has been kidnapped. When she goes to take the cat back, a guy who calls himself the Thief (played by a young Peter Cotterell) shows up, asking for the cat. He has been in a coma for a year, and the cat is the only thing that allows him to regain his memories. When the Rat returns, the thief tries to sell the cat for a fortune. The cat gets free, and they have a good laugh. Then things get a bit serious. The Thief tries to rob a bank, but there are too many guards. The rat shows up with a gun (a gun that shoots rat poison), and the thief is unable to escape. Rat poison is not very good...and it is a very expensive cure. When Rat has more money, he goes on to help his friend, the Cat. So begins a good old-fashioned family movie.   All of this is just great, but the movie is about much more than just a comedy. The plot of the movie could easily be the plot of a horror movie: a young woman wakes up to find her father having a terrible hangover the next morning. But the thing that really makes the movie stand out is the great performance by Mary Steenburgen. You can't miss the way that the movie uses Steenburg in this film. I can't even begin to tell you how great Steenburg has become. When I started watching the movie, I was a little concerned about her. She is only in one scene, and it is just an introduction. However, Steenburg showed her best performance the next day, in her appearance in the police station. Steenburg shows the same range of emotions she has been using in other parts of the picture to great effect. The movie even makes use of Steenburg as an extra. One scene where the thief takes the rat away seems to have some kind of influence on the poor rat, who later returns as a rat-faced thief. This is a perfect example of

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is great. Great characters, and a great plot. The movie even has a happy ending after a long and hard ride. I enjoyed it immensely. I think it is a classic, and it is also one of the best action movies ever made. This is my favorite movie of all time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is not just a good science fiction movie but a masterpiece. It starts with the story of a young man (played by John Cusack) who lives in a small town (actually the title of the movie is the place where this story takes place), where people still live in the same way they did before the nuclear war in the 60s. His girlfriend, who is a girl (in this story she is actually a girl), is married to another man. After a long time the young man, who wants to join the air force but doesn't have the money to do so, wants to do something about it. He decides to go to New York to a military base, which is not too far away. Once there, he meets the commander of the base. He gets acquainted with the soldiers, who give him a lot of trouble but he gets a job as a messenger and is taken to the base, where he is to carry out a mission. The story is told in a very interesting way: the characters have nothing special and can't do much to solve the problem of the young men. All the same the movie keeps a funny and touching atmosphere.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you have seen it you know that it's a classic. It has a sense of humor about it and the jokes are so well-done. I also enjoyed the way the actors and actresses played it. If you like good old westerns it is not a bad film at all.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  An excellent film from 1960. A very good and interesting film about the "Tough Guy" with an interesting twist.  The film was actually made for $100,000,000 by the same people who did the "The Seven Year Itch" and "Cocaine." "Hard-Boiled" was made in just over a year, was shot in 70mm (a rare feat these days), and had great reviews in critics' circles at the time. It featured great acting and was an instant hit, winning several awards and even becoming the most profitable movie ever made at the box-office.   "Hard-boiled" has great performances by several notable actors. "I'm Not a Man" has a great performance by a young John Wayne who plays the tough guy. "The Girl of the Road" is a very fine performance by Betty Grable who is a young woman whose parents don't know of her existence. The film is about a young tough guy's journey to make a fortune. "Easy Living" is an excellent character study of a woman who has no desire to make money. "Big City Blues" is another excellent story which is told in a humorous fashion. The title role was taken by a newcomer named James Coburn, but he was not given much to work with. The real star is Wayne, who is good in every role, is a wonderful actor, and really made the film. It has the feel of an old film like "The Hustler." The acting is excellent and it has a wonderful ending. This is a classic film and I would highly recommend it to those who have yet to see it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There aren't many great films from Japan, but this one has all the elements. It's a good film, with a good cast and wonderful music. I was surprised by the way the film was cut by its American distributor because it doesn't appear to be anything special. I guess it's good because it's not bad at all and I didn't realize how good it was until I saw the film in its original Japanese.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was very curious about this film but found that I found it much more engaging than I anticipated. This is very much a character driven story with an interesting twist to it. For those unfamiliar with the story, we learn that a mysterious figure enters their living room to tell the family a story. In the story he tells the father of the protagonist, the family finds a dead body, the body is described to be that of a young woman, that she was murdered, as if by the hands of a vampire. That is very odd since the protagonist is a vampire and this would normally be the part where the vampire would kill the family. The father doesn't believe this story but his son does and decides that they must go to a nearby church to find out what happened. But first, the protagonist must have a private audience with his father who has become very ill. Then a vampire is seen near his father and the father is killed. The next morning the family gathers around the body and it is said to be a human body which the vampire stole from the grave. It is very similar to a few horror movies from the 70's and 80's. However, this is not a slasher film like one might think. Instead, it is a character comedy. The protagonist is very disturbed and this is the catalyst that draws him into this supernatural story. He is an interesting young man who is quite lonely, he does not feel he is fit for anything in life but he wants to make a difference. This would not be very original, but he is played very well by John Hurt who plays the role well and does a very good job making the audience care about his character. The screenplay is extremely well written and the plot is very well developed. If a movie was this good and the movie was the only thing you would see on TV, you would probably go out and find a nice quiet place to sit and watch it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought the movie was pretty good.   The story told in this movie has a lot of heart, a lot fun and lots of comedy.  This movie, like all of the others, is a very entertaining film.  The story is very realistic, well written and well shot.  There is a lot more humor in this film, a little more heart.  The only problem I had with this movie was that I thought it would be a little longer, but it ended too fast. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was introduced to this movie, for which I'm grateful in part because I had a hard time finding something to watch on the weekend.  It's a short, funny little movie.  It features an annoying but amusing (as well as funny) character named Mr. Smithson.    When he is in his room, there is a bird flying around him and on the wall is a picture of a girl that has his name written across her arm.  In the morning he tells the girl, "It's me."   It's funny, simple, funny, but it still needs more than that.  I like it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie The Good Dinosaur was released in April of 2014 in the UK and May of 2014 on the USA, and although it's got some pretty good special effects and is not as silly as some of the recent movies, it has a pretty good storyline and a good message as the dinosaur, Rex (voiced by a very pleasant Sir Ian McKellen, who in my humble opinion is the greatest Doctor Who actor to have ever lived) and the boy named Max (voiceless), meet and decide that they will be best friends. I found the movie to be very beautiful. I didn't think it could be much better.  After a montage of the dinosaurs that have inhabited the earth throughout history, the story is told in a pretty standard manner, but then the plot thickens and some really awesome special effects, and we get to see the dinosaurs in action, which is what really makes this movie. The animation is very fluid and the story and characters are very well thought through and developed.  I enjoyed this movie a lot, and it really does a good job at taking dinosaurs back to their prehistoric roots.  The Good Dino is the most enjoyable movie I have seen in a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I always say that there is nothing worse than watching something you already enjoyed on film and finding out that it was only in poor taste, so it's a shame that I found the director to be so dull. His wife is so desperate to get to England that she will do anything for that opportunity and that's the main problem. The husband is supposed to be a man of action, and he doesn't even show any sort of effort and in fact seems to be enjoying the scenery. It's a pity he doesn ers that don't include a lot of comedy, especially as in the end when we see them on the beach after getting the opportunity to get married, it's too easy for him to laugh at her, especially when they get on a boat and her husband looks at her funny but she just laughs too and then starts to run down the beach. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are not many horror films that you can take out to a party, but this one is one of them.  The director, Robert Luketic is one funny man.  I always think he is the greatest horror director of all time because he is an innovator.  He is one hundred percent original.  For some reason, he is also one hundred per cent hilarious, too.  It is a film with a lot of heart and it is truly scary.  Robert Luketics is the king of funny, not to mention horror.  This is a perfect movie to go to for a night with friends.

I love the story line about Mr. White and his wife (one of my favorite characters to watch) and I couldn't wait to see more of them. They are so fun to see and it's great to see the same set of characters over and over again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the best action movie of the summer. The set pieces are great, the special effects great. And even better is that it's not just a super-stylized battle between two forces fighting one another. They actually work well together as a team. I found myself watching the first 20 minutes of this movie with a smile on my face as I thought: this isn't going to be the same movie twice! The battle scenes between the two teams are brilliant. Their teamwork is superb. I love the use of the giant machine guns to destroy vehicles of all types and sizes: The first scene is pretty neat when the tank's turret is blown out of the way and it's the only thing stopping the enemy from reaching the bridge at the start of the battle. Later we get some superb scenes between two enemy soldiers, one a tough guy who is in for a nasty surprise. At one point he is knocked off his bike and is then run over by a tank. It's the first time I've seen an action scene like that. The movie makes good use of its action, too, as it plays up the action-movie genre in a way that is never a bit too overdone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want a good time, go see the movie; if you want to know if it's better than the originals, then watch it. The actors are the same.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, I had high hopes for this.  We've been through this, people.    I'd even have a pretty good guess at the ending, or at least the one that makes a good story, but then it just dropped the ball with this movie.  It was the worst movie I've ever seen, and I'm not ashamed to say that I laughed my ass off the whole way through, it was horrible.  I've seen worse movies, I've been to worse haunted houses, I'd rather go to a cemetery than see a movie like this.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a nice little little little indie movie. Some very talented people got together to make a movie that takes you through the lives of a handful of kids: one of them plays the accordion, another one sings the piano, and the last one, as it happens, is a musician too.   The movie also has a couple of great songs: the song for the accordin player was written by John Barrymore, the song about the piano player is, of course, by his famous friend, Paul Anka, and, ofcourse, the lovely song about my favorite child, the musician named Max, is by the great folk singer/songwriter, Frank Sinatra!    In fact, so much of this movie is sung by Frank Sinatra that it feels more like a song, than a movie: Frank Sinbad   is a good little movie, a nice and heartwarming bit of family entertainment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun movie. It's also quite silly. The main character (the girl) has a very strange personality. And she acts like a child with an imaginary friend. This is not to say that she doesn't get all of the comedy. She does. The movie is about a young boy, David, and his pet dog. At one point in time, David's father dies in a motorcycle accident. David becomes a sad and lonely boy. His father is dead and David is left alone in a world he can't understand. David's dog (an imaginary one) starts acting weird, and even goes into a rage at this time. One of the funniest things in the movie is when David starts to play with his imaginary friend as a kid. He does it very badly. He goes out of the house, knocks on doors, goes outside, etc. He keeps knocking on doors and eventually starts hitting himself with a shovel, then with a bicycle. At the end of the movie, when David's imaginary friend takes flight again, David runs after him. The camera goes behind him and a voice over says that he was so close to running into him.

If you enjoy horror movies this is the one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To the movie's credit (the movie!), it isn't a bad one. It has its charms. For a movie that is about the life of a woman who has fallen in love with a man she knows nothing about, it has some great performances. It also has a few great, if not a little odd moments (e.g., a black man and an Asian woman in a movie theater). Overall, an enjoyable, but unremarkable movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went to see this at the cinema with a friend because I saw a promo video for it and I was curious. So when I got to the cinema I was very disappointed. At first the movie started off very entertaining as the main character gets kidnapped and held in a dark alleyway. There are also other kids that get kidnapped and they are all very creative in making it interesting!  I was then taken to another dark alley where the main characters friend (Crazy Davey) starts to go crazy and tries to kidnap as many kids as he can in the hopes of getting paid back by the rich people who kidnapped him. The other kids are now all trying to get away from the crazy guy and some of them are actually good. But then we come to the point in the movie where the madman has a gun and is standing right outside a dark building.  He then decides to break into the building and kills anyone that he can and then takes a hostage.  I had to force myself to be brave and jump out the windows onto a car as this happened in front of my friends face!  The end of the movie then is the gang getting to the door of the hotel where the rich rich guy is staying.  This movie is very disappointing for the characters and the story.

The script is even more funny this time. They go to a funeral where there's a man who was killed by a truck. His name is Sam and he was in the film "The Last Picture Show." I haven' t seen the sequel, but it looks like it's even funnier. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been looking for a good zombie movie since I first saw Outbreak in 2004, and this film is a really good one. The story is pretty simple, and there's plenty of gore, but there's also a great amount of action which is something that really isn't done often. It also has a great sense of humor, and when you watch it you'll laugh and you'll also feel a lot of fear.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film starts out with a beautiful blue skies over a white landscape and a soft, serene song that is about the beauty of the universe, of the vastness of the stars and the moon, the stars in their infinite, infinite glory, the moon in its infinite, endless darkness. And then the black hole appears. It seems to be a big, black hole, an immense black hole that sucks in everything and then it gets released all at once. A tremendous and unending explosion. And we see the moon slowly descend toward the black, black, dark hole. And the moon is not very bright. It just gets smaller and smaller and eventually disappears, goes from black to white. And there we're told that it has been there for the last 6 billion years, that it's been there ever since the birth of the earth and the first star. We see the two stars. And they are going to be burned out and all the planets and stars and everything will die except for this black, empty black hole. (I'm sure there are others. There are so many movies like this on the screen that I can't imagine them all. In fact, the last part of the film is a great film of a man trying to escape and live off the land so that he can be a hunter and a fisherman. There's a great part of it about a black hole in an empty, cold, dark room and a man having a hard time with the situation. He's been here forever and there's nothing left. All that is left is this black hole.) And then we're in space. And this is a pretty decent-looking space, but we're not allowed to see very much. (This is because we can't move. If we move a little bit we can see it more clearly. The other thing is that there are things in space like planets and star. They can look pretty good. It's an interesting area.) I can imagine that this movie was made by a man who was very interested in space, and so we get a lot about it, but it's very hard to make any kind of scientific sense out of it. You don't notice the planets in space but they can look very good. You can see the stars. You're not really in space when the movie begins, but there is a big black hole all around and then the film ends in space and we see a beautiful, beautiful, huge star. That is our first glimpse of
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about a woman who wants to marry a rich man.  But instead of doing so she ends up being kidnapped by a guy who wants her dead (for cheating on him).  He gives her a car, but not a very good one.      The next morning, this woman meets the man's brother who asks her out for coffee.  In the coffee shop he explains that the rich guy he thinks is dead is not dead, that instead he is at a house with his daughter and his brother.  But there's something more mysterious.  There's a demon who has been watching them, and is about to kill them.  They try to escape, but it is impossible, so they try to kill the demon.  It fails because he is made of ice, and freezes in place when they try.  What a boring film! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this film to be a little overhyped, but it did do a good job of reminding us that the original Ghostbusters were not merely an action-movie comedy.   One of the film's few good scenes is a scene that's been re-created in other films (like a little kids' science-fiction story about a ghost with a laser-ball).   This scene doesn't work so well because they're using the original material, but that was a nice touch in a movie that had a few other nice touches. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a great day to be a fan of the Star Wars universe. It was really nice to see the crew of the Millennium Falcon in a movie again, the way they've been all these years.  This movie was well-acted and has great special effects.   If you've not seen the original movies or the prequels yet, you're in for a treat.  I think the prequel will be good as well, but I'm a little sad to see them go so soon, although I suppose they did want to focus on Han Solo.  As far as other Star Wars movies go, they're just a little better than the others, but this was still a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is one of those special ones where you think that you're watching something really stupid but the more you watch it the more it gets more funny and more outrageous until you realize that the makers wanted to do a serious comedy.   "What is the purpose of a movie called ?" asks the man in a yellow hat.  In the film, he plays a character who has been called upon to appear in a very serious court case but he's too smart and has an escape plan.  But there's more to the film than funny people who seem to have a knack for life.  Well, not exactly a life but it certainly does include some great comedy.     This is a film about a man, Frank and his girlfriend, Jeanine. Frank is an arrogant man and Jeanine a pretty face, who are married at least three times.  Frank has become very bitter towards Jeanine, who he feels has a very small amount of sex and wants to be married to one of her friends.   The only problem is, Jeanines friend is none other than Jean Paul and when Jean Paul gets pregnant, Frank wants Jeanine to abort the baby.   But just when that is about to happen, Frank has an idea:  How about, instead of having Jeanine abort the pregnancy, he and Jean Paul pretend that it never happened and go on with their lives?   The film has a hilarious ending when Jeanine's husband gets a job in Hollywood and then she gets a new boyfriend and then a new husband.    In spite of its bizarre comedy, the film is not at all bad.  The acting is mostly OK and the story is also rather funny.  I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to laugh their butt off.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would like to thank you for this movie. It really surprised me in many ways. It has all the elements a good drama should have: a good main character, a good supporting characters, and a good villain. It does not come off as cheesy or contrived, and while there are some silly scenes, there are no stupid scenes here. The acting was very good throughout; I have a strong feeling it was directed by Michael Mann and I think it does a good job of capturing the mood of the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had only seen this movie so many times that I had to get a friend of mine to watch it for me and my husband.  That's when we started to really enjoy it.   It's been over a decade since this movie was made, so I think it's time to make it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good thriller set in the early 20th century, with a strong villain. The story is simple: an American businessman visits a mysterious hotel in Paris, where he encounters an elderly man, who later dies. The businessman, who goes by the pseudonym of Mr. Jigger, is an ex-military man with a good head on his shoulders. The hotel is not a hotel at all, but rather a subterranean tunnel connected by a network of pipes that provide electricity to the tunnel. This is an interesting concept, and one that is certainly worth seeing. The actors did a very good job, and it's definitely one of the few good action movies of the early 1950s (this is what is known as the "Maverick" era of Hollywood).
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a movie that is basically a re-hash of what had come before, The Lost Boys does a good job of holding its own.   It is fast-paced, funny and not at all derivative of its predecessors, in that it has a good amount of character development in each one of the members of the Lost Boys. There are also a number of memorable one-liners in the film, which would be the perfect material for an ersatz sitcom.     It is a good-hearted romp and a great adventure movie with a very happy ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are no such things as bad movie plots, and for the most part, the movie has good ones. The film stars William Holden and his younger brother, the late, great, Jim Morrison. Jim is a troubled, violent man whose family have moved from California to New Jersey and the brothers have been forced to move back in with their grandfather. Things seem to be looking up for Jim and Holden's life when their grandmother tells them she has a "dream" for them and Jim, being one of the few remaining dreamers of his generation, jumps at the chance to be in the movies. The two brothers make the rounds in various New York City movie houses, taking part in some of the more amusing scenes. One night in a nightclub, Jim takes a walk, but is confronted by one of his tormentors. He beats and rapes him, then Jim goes to the restroom and makes himself a drink of beer. When he returns to the table he sees that someone has cut his hair, and a few drinks later, the two meet up with the other dreamers and the movie begins. The dream sequences are extremely funny, and the film has many such scenes. But the film is also very violent and contains several scenes of actual, physical violence. I can say that the film was, at times, a lot funnier than it was violent, but the point is that the violence was used to a purpose, as it was to make the film more funny, while the violence and the humor were combined in such a way that the audience didn't get so tired that they couldn't take another drink.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In some ways it is similar to 'Scooby Doo' but, I feel, has the character's personality more in common with 'Sesame Street'. 'It's Me, The Dandy' is funny, weird and funny. If you like a good story, then this is a good one to take a look at. It's a great example of a film that is funny without being stupid (or preachy) and, if you like your comedy to be silly, then it is funny. It may be silly in parts, but it is also very smart and imaginative (and yes, it has a few clever (and very well played) guest actors). The music is nice and all the actors are good. 'It''s Me, the Dandy'' is a must see for children and adults alike!

A film that deserves to be seen by everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best film to ever be released by Universal Pictures. It is a great time for old school horror. There are not a lot of big budget horror films out there right now. Sure, the genre is starting to get out of control, but you can't argue with a classic like Frankenstein. The movie has a great cast and everyone does an awesome job! It's so well made. It has that "old school" feel that was so very appreciated in the 80's. If you are a fan of old school monster movies, this should be on your list. You won't be disappointed!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not sure when this is the first time i've watched a movie with this particular premise and this particular cast. I had a little trouble getting into this movie, as I have seen too many comedies with that format, but once I got on it i was in love with the concept and the cast and it was just perfect to be one part of a double feature with a musical. I didn't even know who Chris Pine was until this movie was over and I'm a very lucky guy. I would love to see more from him, though I'm sure he'll continue to be a hot commodity.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to say this movie is a real crowd pleaser.  It is a good way to relax after a long day, but also it is a great way to learn how to play the violin.    When I first heard about this film I was wondering where I could find something that looked a little more interesting than a lot of the other stuff I saw that week.    Well this movie got me thinking!   I did like it a lot and enjoyed it a whole lot! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like this movie a lot. It's an awesome comedy that has just about everything going for it. The cast is great and the action is very good. It just happens to be one of those movies that the audience has to wait for for at least 3 hours. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The whole movie is so incredibly entertaining. The acting, direction, and production value are all top-notch. The cinematography is breathtaking. And what's more, the performances are terrific!  This is a must-see.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me this was just the first movie that shows the horror movie genre. It's not perfect but it was enjoyable from start to finish and if you like scary movies I think you'll like this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie, and the action and humor are well done. The movie takes place in France, and it shows us how much our society has developed to the point where things like this are not unheard of. The two young thieves try to escape capture, and they have to find a way to get out. They go up to a house to get a key, and as they are about to enter, they are surprised to find they can't go in. Then it seems that they need to do something to get their freedom, and one of them starts to cry.  The movie is funny enough, and I like how it takes place mostly at night. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are lots of good movies in this film and they all manage to stand the test of time. The action is really good, and the story is a good enough one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first three quarters of the movie are a classic B movie from a classic director. There are a number of action sequences in this movie, but none are particularly thrilling, because this is a story about the man who tries to save his daughter from a madman by killing the maniac, but instead accidentally ends up helping the madman kill his wife, in an action film that seems rather tame compared to the more exciting ones of the '60s. There's a good story here, and plenty of humor, and this is certainly a classic in the genre. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a young boy when this movie came out.   The first time I saw it was while I was standing in the car next to my Dad.  He was watching the movie on TV (remember those TV stations?   ) and the show didn't mention a lot of the story lines from the original film.  I thought I was the only one watching that film, so I decided to take a chance and see what the heck this was all about.  The movie was so long back then that it didn't matter to anyone who lived through it.  It's a mystery that I still have not been able to figure out.     At the time I was just beginning to become a fan of the silent film and the new techniques used in the films.  This particular film is one of the first examples of what we now call a "flash back" in a film.   It was also the first one with a big, bad villain.  A movie like this is the first film to bring us the look back at some of Hollywood's greats in action.  And of course, when a villain like Dracula comes on the screen, the whole film does something to the audience.  What's so interesting about this film is that it has everything in the world to make it one of Hollywood history's great movies.  There are no real flaws with it. It's full of great acting and great sound.  All that's missing is a black and white version of this movie so that the rest of us will know what Dracula looked like.  That would make this movie perfect!   It is so bizarre that a film like this would have come out in the era where silent films were becoming a little more popular.  For those not familiar with the genre, there were also a number of films that came out around the same time as Dracula which, although less exciting, still featured some truly scary and frightening scenes.   The fact that we have all these stories that predate the release of this film makes me wonder what all the fuss was about when they released this film?   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found my next favorite movie: " The Secret of NIMH "  When a girl (played by Lillie Bright) moves to NIM HOPKINS, Iowa and begins her new life, she quickly learns the beauty, charm and charm of Nimmie Amee Hunkins, aka Nimmies.   The Secret of the Nimm-Mees begins with an unexpected sighting of a mysterious figure who is looking for the Nims' farm house in their little town.  The mystery takes the young girl to the house where she meets the mysterious woman who invites her to a party at the house. The next thing she knows, she is the center of an international crime.  A long-running string of crimes has been committed by a group of strangers who roam the countryside in the middle of the night, stealing from travelers, killing livestock, abducting young women, and torturing pets. These "clowns", as they are called by one of the girls, are all very attractive in their own ways: They are intelligent, articulate, good-looking and very clever.  They are all of different ages, yet all share a distinct quality to them.  With the exception of one "lover" who is a complete freak and is never around, they all have a connection to NimmIE Hunkin-Nims.  Nimmi, like other Nimmis, has had her heart broken many times.  But each time it is by someone else- a man who tries to steal her, a man that is jealous of her love for another, or a man with a horrible temper who never stops cursing, insulting and attacking.  In fact, the young woman who meets this new group of clowns is the one to find out the reason behind all of their crimes.  And that is when she and a group at work are able to put an end to these clowns once and for all.   The Secret's a fast paced film that doesn't take a long time to get to the action.  That's not a bad thing.  Its a lot more than just fast pacing.  While the clowns are getting things done, the movie is also telling a story that is just as interesting.  But I'm not just talking about the stories- the action is also amazing.  When I was a kid, I remember a show called "Rugrats", where they all had crazy hair
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You can get an awful lot of satisfaction out of the way a bad movie is shot.   In this case I don't feel like one of those film-review-writing idiots who thinks "You should shoot a bad action movie!" and then goes out and does it, but if one were to do so it would be no different from those films that feature people trying to make out with each other.  What is really remarkable about this movie is the fact that it is able to be funny while also being violent.  It is not that there is a sense of wit or a sense that a movie has a point and is making some sort of point; on the contrary it just seems to come out and say "Kill all the Jews".   The action is, first, pretty pathetic.  They use a crane for the entire movie and no one can even see it coming because it never looks very impressive; no one seems to have any reason to try to escape from it.  The other thing is that they try to make it a metaphor; the Jews will use every tactic to kill the other Jews and even if the Nazis somehow manage to get out, the Jewish terrorists would then come back in to finish the job.  This movie has more points to make than a movie about a bunch of Jewish terrorists.  I will go into what it is about the movie that is so awful.  A group of three young men break into the home of a wealthy Jew who is away on vacation.  In the house they kill everyone and then they go back out in the forest to kill some more.  At this point they are caught in a storm and have to make their way out of it in order to get to safety.  One of the young men, a Jew named Yossel, is captured by the Nazis who shoot him at point blank range.  He dies from his wound.  Then it turns out that the Jew is also dead.  When the other two men (two Jewish terrorists) come back, one of them says something like, "It's a small world."  They also take the bodies of some of the dead Nazis into the forest and then go out and kill more. They kill an elderly woman, a boy who was a member of a religious group, a girl and the elderly Rabbi.  These are all people the Nazis don't like, because they are the Nazis.  Of all of the Nazi victims that these
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What can I say about this movie? It's a fun romp, if not a tad slow and drawn out. It's hard to find a good romance story out there with anything resembling substance. This one is definitely not good, but it's definitely not bad, either. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very nice looking film about a man whose son is having a bad day and his boss is going to leave him to take care of the family. The kid is very unhappy and starts to cry. So the man decides to take him to a swimming pool in a hot tub. When they get there, it's obvious that the kid is not the happy person he was before the swim. We can see the sadness in the kid's eyes, and we can see his father really caring for him, but he just doesn't know what to do. The father has a good relationship with his mother and we are told that he was a very good dad, but the man is clearly frustrated and feels he can't do anything about the problems his son is facing. We are told a lot about what the kid went through that day, but it's not really the sort of detail that will help us with the problems the kids are going to face in the future, which is just bad. The director knows how to show a good deal of emotion in a film, but his direction isn't very good and it lacks detail and charm. It's not a bad film, it was a good film, just not a good one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember being at a friend's house. As I said, this is not an easy film to watch. The premise (it's a TV movie) is silly and it's the first movie I ever saw in which a young girl is raped. This is one of those movies that you have to see to really believe. This film is pure escapism.  It is a "bad" film.  I thought it was very funny and at times very touching.   I think it has a bit of the surreal about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favourite horror movie of all time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like this movie and I'm happy the trailer made it out so well because it does not look like the usual "action horror" movie. Yes, it's about a killer who looks like a big hairy monkey (the best I've seen!). The way he kills people is really very gruesome and violent and there are lots of bloody hands and heads around. There is nothing that looks so fake as some of the kills in this movie. The gore is not excessive and the movie takes its time showing us the gruesome way to kill the killer who does not use much force in his kills. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was quite pleased with this movie. It's not that it doesn't have some good points. It does. However, it is a good film in all its respects. It has an excellent soundtrack and a good cast of characters. It is also very well done in its story, that is about a young couple going to live in a small cottage on a farm and raising some pigs. They start off as a nice couple who are happy living like that. However it turns out that their neighbor is a bad guy who has stolen money from them over a long time. One of the couple gets kidnapped to marry a pretty girl and is told by the evil neighbor that if he refuses he will also be killed. The couple decides to escape on horseback with the daughter, who has a strange fascination with the evil neighbors. They escape and come to a town where there are various bad and evil people and the bad people make the good people do bad things. Things get worse with the bad guys wanting to put people to death and the nice people try to be good so they don't get killed. Then the film turns to a scene where the daughter meets an ugly woman with the face of a fish and the body of a woman. She falls in love with the beautiful woman who falls in with the vicious guy. The two have an affair. I've heard of things like this and I don't know what to say. The movie has a very interesting storyline with it's great music. However the ending is a disappointment. I don`t know. I watched it because I knew I would like it. I can only guess what happened. I like the soundtrack and the cast of the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie. The performances are top notch and so are the plots. One of the best I've seen all year. This movie is not for the faint of heart and is definitely for people who like to watch an awesome movie with a great script.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't remember what happened, but my brother was driving. After a while it seemed he'd been stuck for an hour or more. There was a bit of traffic, and he finally got to the park. The ranger let him out and said a few words to my brother. It's not easy to tell the difference between a squirrel and a bird. This little bird came down and sat right on the trunk, then it crawled up to the tree. It was a very graceful little bird. I've never seen anything like it. My brother couldn't stand to shoot it with the rifle. It must have been a dead bird, but it kept pecking, and pecking. And pecking! When my brother finally shot it, it just pecked away. I was surprised, and not a little scared. I don't know how long it was doing that, but I guess it must have gotten bored by the noise. It eventually decided to move on. The bird's feathers had a strange gray-white color. But it didn't have a very good chance. It landed on the ground like a broken glass. But that wasn't the end of it. It climbed the tree and climbed up to a higher branch. My uncle got out of the car to get a flashlight, and there was the little squirrel sitting up there pecking away. At first he didn't make much noise at all, but he began to squawk. There were a few birds pecking around the tree, and one came down. I didn't think a squirrel could eat so much bird food. The thing was getting big, too. It didn't seem to be very hungry, though. The little bird began to fly away. The squirrel kept flying into the trees, pecking and pecking, and eating bird food and tree fruit. Finally it landed on a branch, and the little bird was eating from the branch like a bird would. The whole time my uncle was holding the flashlight. When the little thing flew away, the squirrel flew up a few more inches and pecksed away at a tree, peck, pecker, pecks. So, my uncle tried to put the flashlight away, and it flew off, and then it landed in the bushes a few feet away. My Uncle tried to look for it, but the squirrel had disappeared. He couldn't find it either, and couldn't get close enough to look at it. Finally, he gave up
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this one! It has a lot of weird elements going on including sex and murder and weirdness and horror in general. The first half has some truly awesome scenes that make the film well worth seeing. If you can get through the first half you are in for a real treat and then the second half really gets going. The ending of the film was extremely well done. I would like to give a special mention to a great supporting character. If anyone is watching this film then please give it a try it is a little odd but definitely a great film!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those rare instances where a movie about a bad guy is actually pretty good. It's the kind of movie where if you don't love the bad guys, then you're not really a true believer.   So we've got a guy who just got out of prison, who's on the run, and who has no idea where he is or how he got there. He finds himself, in a weird town, in the midst of a battle between evil and good.  But not just any battle! He finds a bunch of really, really bad guys running around with guns who don't mind if he's there, and don't care if he hurts them.  And if they didn't mind that, then they wouldn't have a reason to shoot their guns at him.  This could be the most awesome action movie ever, except we don't know if that's possible.  So what do we have here? A buddy picture of the good guys! (Oh, and some great music, too.)   Well, we have a buddy picture? This movie is actually a pretty good buddy picture, except that the bad guy and the good guy don't get along very well. I mean, we don 't know what happens between the good and the bad, so who knows whether it's all right for a movie like this to have a bad and good buddy?  And, you know, I think the real problem with this movie is that the dialogue between our guys is really, REALLY bad! You've got the guy who talks like he was born yesterday (and the same guy who's talking about the bad buddy), and you have the other guy who says things like "I'd like to be a real man, but I can't be a man anymore."   Yes, that's actually worse than the actual movie, since at least the bad and the evil don't actually die.  This movie has some serious potential.  Yes!  Well?  Well it turns out we actually get a pretty interesting story here. And the good part is that it's all just a metaphor.  There's no real villain behind this movie. The bad guy doesn't do anything bad, and the only evil thing he does is shoot his gun.  What we have is an actual town, and a guy named Charlie, who wants to help people, but can't because of his criminal past (which we learn early on
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you hear this movie, and in fact when I hear about a "Darth Vader" movie, or any movie that is not supposed to make me look like I am "a baby", I always think that "Star Wars: A New Hope" and "The Empire Strikes Back" (with the same character named in both, but at different times) are just "Star Trek: The Motion Picture". It's just the same movie, so the same "feel", and the same story of a hero and a good guy trying to take over a bad guy and destroy the Empire. But this movie is better (at least for me, anyway) and it's not just the plot changes from "A New Hope to "The Return of the Jedi" that were really important. This movie has more action and more laughs than "The Motion Picture", which is a good thing. The actors play their parts well, and the special effects are not spectacular by any means, but this is a "Star-Wars" movie and I think that they handled it well. This is not a "The Phantom Menace" movie by any stretch of the imagination, so don't feel bad about not liking it for that reason, it is only one of many examples that prove that the "Star wars" films have "StarTrek" written all over them.

I had a hard time understanding a bit of the dialogue in the beginning and had to go back and rewatch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "This film is about the world of underground cinema and all the stories I heard growing up in a small town in Ontario Canada."   From a small Ontario town, an 18 year-old girl has moved on to the big time when a local film producer offers her a contract to star in one of his films.   When she arrives to the film set, she immediately gets the opportunity to show off her acting skills as a young lady.  But when the film crew discovers what the crew leader and the director have in store for the young girl, she finds herself in a nightmare scenario.  I think I've heard something about this one before. It was originally released in 1983 as The Last Laugh (aka The Last Movie).   I've watched a few movies recently that made me feel that this is the kind of movie that I want to see, but as the synopsis says, it's very unusual for a horror movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of Both Worlds  was a fun, action packed movie. In fact it was too much fun that I wanted a third one. It had a lot of action but I wish it had some good old fashioned fun. That's all it had. This movie does not have any fun at all.    The movie really isn't that funny. It's just good old times action. And don't even get me started on the ending which is not only out of place but downright stupid.  The Best of It All 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I read the book, I was very worried that it would be a long, drawn out movie that was more of a drama than a horror movie. That is not the case with the movie.  My husband went with me.  As soon as we left, we decided to go to a local movie theater and see this.  I think the only reason that it is considered to be a "classic" is because of "Rosemary's Baby."  As I said before, I enjoyed it.  It is very good and has been told a million times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a movie called "A Clockwork Orange", that is a pretty accurate description of the film in general, but it is also a very interesting look into the development of the drug use and the culture of the British Empire.   The film has a very low budget and a small cast, but the director clearly wanted to make a very unique movie that would draw the attention of both critics and the masses.  The only complaints I have with the film are that the sex is repetitive and unnecessary, and that the music in the film is pretty much over used.  The last scene of the movie is so good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In case you haven't heard about it yet, " The Martian " is a thrilling and very imaginative sci-fi film about a robot astronaut (played by Matt Damon) and his mission to save NASA. This movie is filled with interesting concepts and amazing performances. It reminds me a bit of " Blade Runner ", which is really saying something. If you're a sci- fi fan, I would highly recommend " The Mars Story".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To a certain extent, the story of "Ridley Scott: The Martian" (which I watched in the theatre) follows the general plot of the "Riddick" movies, with the protagonist traveling on a spaceship, escaping to another planet, and eventually getting the chance to leave it. But, unlike the Riddick movies, Scott's character in "The Martian" is a lot less heroic than in the others, and even when he's on a mission, he does little to bring his fellow passengers back to Earth. The "Rids" aren't exactly the kind of heroes Scott would want to be, and Scott tries his best to soften the blow by making them "brothers," but when it comes to survival, there's not much going for them, and after Scott's brother is killed by the enemy, he's forced to go back to the planet where he came from. A couple of hours later, he goes back to his own planet, where he finds his mother, who has been killed by a giant spider on her way to the moon. She dies, and it's only the death of a man that keeps him from going to Mars, where the movie ends. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most underrated movies ever! The movie was made during WWII and it is a fantastic movie. It's about the battle of El Alamein in North Africa in 1942. The story revolves around two American soldiers from Massachusetts who were sent to Europe in a convoy to escort a German aircraft to the landing field in order to help out the troops. It is a great story with great acting, great music, and terrific direction. It has one of the best endings of the war (with one of many) involving an actual helicopter that flies right through a flaming bullet. It was a great movie and is a must see for any WWII fan or WWI movie watcher.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this at a screening hosted by the New York City chapter of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. I didn't know much about them (though I had heard that they were "a little fringe" in terms of their views and that they "have all the good characters in a bad movie").  But they had a large tent and lots of people there, all wearing their purple and black "presents for people who can't speak for themselves" for those of you who remember the old Christmas TV specials (which I did).  The New York chapter of NAMI's is a pretty active organization, and they have chapters all over the country (as well as in Britain) and Canada.  In New York, they had the "Theatre for the NAMI Mind" with their NAMI-themed play, which has a fairly good cast and a decent plot and some good actors.    The setting was a mental health clinic, with the patients being played by mental health professionals.  At a certain point, the story veers off into a very interesting direction.  The "hero" is playing a piano at a church where there is a wedding taking place.  As he sings a song to the bride and groom, a nurse appears.  She seems to be going about her usual job, checking the pulse and the heart.  So the protagonist's character is to perform a concert so that the doctor can hear the music.  But what does he think he is doing playing the piano when he is actually trying to save someone's life?  He has never performed before, so what is he doing?   And it's not a happy ending.  After a while he stops playing the music and is sent home.  It is all too much for the protagonist who has started to lose hope in humanity.  He finally starts the concert which, of course, fails.  His wife is also diagnosed as having "Bipolar II", which is apparently a more serious illness than "puppy love" in New York.  I do think, though, that the story itself had something going for it.  A doctor talking about mental illness is really a nice thing.  And the cast is really good.  There are some interesting parts of the story, but not much more than that.  Even with that, I wasn't quite as interested in it as I should have been.  Of course, I would not have
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was thoroughly engrossed by this film. I was especially intrigued by the character of John Galt (played by Robert DeNiro). Galt is the most important figure in my life because he introduced the idea that capitalism can be both humane and efficient. I would give this a good rating if not for the ending which was not very good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great example of how Hollywood was making the movies of the day and how little was made about the actual content of the movies: I have never, in all my time, seen a movie with more nudity and explicit sexual content than this one, although it was released a year later.    In the movie, John Wayne plays a man who tries to sell an old car he bought. Wayne is a tough man, very much like George C. Scott who played the tough, tough guy in the movie. And, unlike Scott, Wayne had a long career and was known for his tough acting and the scenes where he used his chest and his arms to punch out his opponent in the ring, the movies were so violent at the time.  John Wayne's character, of course, is played by a man, Dick Powell (with a slight African-American accent), who has been trying to sell a car with an old lady in it. The lady in the car is played in the film by a young blonde and is also very sexy and a good actress, and the other characters also have some sex appeal. The scene where Wayne drives his old car from the lot, up to the old lady (who is still on top), who then asks if he would drive her car to the lot and to the place where they sell cars, Wayne says yes and they drive off together. Wayne's ex-wife, Edith Sitwell (a good actress), and his younger daughter, Betty Lou (a beautiful little girl) are then sitting next to the door.  The camera zooms in on them and the naked, naked young women are then shown on the ground.  And, after the car drives off, they get into their own car and drive away.  A good movie...!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't want to give it a one-star review but I'm sorry to say that this isn't a great movie. The first scene is bad enough. The rest of the movie is pretty mediocre, with the last third being the best. It was a decent enough movie to be entertaining in a non-fantasy movie and in a fantasy movie, a lot of the stuff could probably be done better. I guess it is a good exercise in how much the actors need to learn to play their characters better: the acting in the final battle scene was atrocious! It was all over the place and the direction was just awful. That said, the movie was quite enjoyable if you were only there for the adventure and don't think a lot about the plot: this could be entertaining if you are on an adventure with friends.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this will definitely end up being one of the top five most famous movies of all time.   With the exception of the original Star Wars, this is probably the biggest, baddest, most badass Star Wars movie and it does it without any "dumb" humor or cheesiness.  If you love Star Wars (and I sure do) then I highly recommend this movie for your viewing pleasure. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In a nutshell, this is the story of what it's like to be a man: how, at the age of 40, with the best friend you could ever wish for on your arm and everything in your life looking up, you decide to get married. This is the kind of love story that makes me long for an old-fashioned 1950s version of the movie Love Story, except with a younger, happier hero and a few extra romantic bits.   There are a couple of interesting things about this movie: first, how much time must have gone by in the life of a real man when the notion of getting married is so shocking and yet so easily taken for granted, especially since the woman is very young (only 17) and thus a potential plaything for the man's every whim. (Though it should be pointed out that in some other movies such as the one I mentioned, the older woman is treated quite well and even a little heroines are included, so I was surprised to find such an understated version.)   Second, we are forced to remember that there really are a number of well-written male writers out there who can write an appealing (though sometimes somewhat corny) love story without resorting to blatant romance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is not about a car chase or a battle, but a story about an ordinary person who, in a very unusual way, tries to make his way through his busy life.   This is not a movie about an interesting car chase; it's a movie of a regular person trying his best to lead a normal life without going off the rails and without forgetting his friends and neighbors. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not a huge sci-fi fan but I like this one. If it looks like Alien, it can't be bad, right? A few people I know that I thought looked like "bad actors" in the movie had a few very interesting ideas, like how some people are infected by these aliens. If you don't care about aliens and alien/robotic-human hybrids, you might like this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very different movie from the typical "monster-movie" tropes we normally get, but one that has a very memorable ending.   The story takes place in a small town in the mountains: a remote region of Colorado with a history as one of the last frontier mining communities and a strong presence of the occult.  But it's not just a mining town.  A couple of years ago the family of the local sheriff became stricken with a horrible sickness that makes them act completely out of character.  In the last few days a new sheriff was elected and is currently in search of the mystery of the town's sickness.  The film is very much about the psychological implications of an illness as well as what happens to the town after the death of the old sheriff.  It is also quite different in the sense that it is not a conventional monster movie but instead a psychological thriller.  Even though it is a very different style, it has very much to say about the nature of disease as well the psychological effects of a small isolated town on a community. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies I've ever seen is "The Wizard of Oz", and one of the few movie's with live action that's really worth watching, is the original version starring Don Ameche.   I've never seen it with the English dub, but it's a good watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went to see this when I wasn't sure if the film would work and I think it did, despite the problems it had. I didn't mind the fact that the ending was bad, that the film was a bit heavy in places and that the plot was a little thin. I liked a few of the characters, particularly the older woman. I wasn`t a huge fan of the way the film ended, so that really brought down the rating to a 4. I`m glad it didn`t work out though and that it made me look forward to watching the sequel.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie isn't all that good, but it does feature one pretty cool sequence (I believe the title is The Golden Hour  and it would seem to be).  You've probably all seen the movie and it does contain quite a bit of great acting, great visuals, and is a fun little flick.  However, the movie doesn't really have that great an ending that I was hoping for.  In this movie we're introduced to a pretty cool character: a man who can teleport.   As a kid, I had heard of this guy but didn't know if it was going to be in the movie.  After seeing the movie, I realize this is going to feature him and he becomes a big fan of the movie...    So the story goes that, the protagonist gets a dream of a girl.  At the end of the dream, she appears to him and asks to be his girlfriend and they have sex.  Now, it's pretty obvious that the woman in question looks a little bit like me...  So, the story picks up a few months later.  This time, the girlfriend that the guy dreams about is a blonde bombshell.  She's an incredibly beautiful woman and her breasts are really impressive.  That's not even the coolest part about her.  For some reason, she can teleport  around the house and to another location.  You know, that's not really a superpower...  (Okay, we get the superpowers.)   What happens next is a little silly, but fun to see.  The girlfriend wants to live in the house she had dreamed about.  Well, she'd like to have sex with the guy who had been a dream for her (not a terrible idea, right?  This movie could really use some more great dreams.)  Anyway, the girl is having a great time with her boyfriend.  But something happens...  And it's kind of amazing.  Apparently she can control the teleporting ability of the guy she was in love with.  So she takes it up a notch.  And to top it all off, she sends the guy to the same place they were in before and had had sex in the dream.  Yeah...    A lot of weird crap happens, but I'm a sucker for these types of movies.  It's a simple and enjoyable movie with a lot of laughs, but you need to have a pretty big imagination to
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), the first film starring William Wyler, and I really enjoyed it, with one or two quibbles. The film opens on a long shot from a submarine of the U.S. Navy; it then jumps ahead, and cuts to a very dramatic aerial demonstration of a very big airplane. Then there is a very tense and suspenseful moment as one of the spectators watches an airplane fly into a storm, causing the storm to be knocked away from the airplane, but only with severe damage to the airplane; so the spectator has to jump out of a window to reach safety. The camera moves across a large room, looking through a doorway into a very large, very dark and very quiet room; it seems to be a very boring room; a man sits in a chair, and seems to do absolutely nothing. Then one of two men in the room appears in a short skirt, walks over to the man in the chair and asks if he knows how to read. "I can read," the man responds. Then a big black dog appears in the doorway, and the man asks, "Where is the dog?" The dog disappears, then back appears the man, looking very serious. "He's very important," he replies. The man then disappears, and another man enters. The second man turns his back on the first and looks at the second man and says something to him. The first man gets up, leaves the room, and then reappears with the big black ball. He then puts the ball on the desk and opens it; a giant, round black box is in the box. The ball takes off, and flies up to the ceiling. The black ball then comes down and touches the ball box. A voice comes from the box: "We're having a great party and we hope you're going to come!" Everyone leaves the table except the man who put the black ball in the ballbox. The voice continues: "He will not come." The man puts on his shoes and walks out of the room. The scene cuts to another room; the same camera moves about. There is another very big room. This room is lit by a lot of big black bulbs. "Who's in there?" a voice asks from the big glass walls. The giant, black ball suddenly pops up and enters the room through the walls. There are several people on the floor, except for the man. The two other
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I know the trailers are terrible and I have seen the movie twice now, and I am not sure it will be as great as the trailers lead me to believe.   In many ways, this movie is a cross between A Clockwork Orange and The Naked Gun: From the Files of Mr. T.  I was expecting to be in a dystopian future where everyone is naked, and everyone is tortured.  But instead, I was in a room with an empty room, and a bunch of naked people lying on the floor, and an eerie music playing.  This is not a movie I will be watching again soon. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first half of the film is good enough. The main characters are likable, the plot is a reasonable, albeit short, and interesting, the story is easy to follow, there's not much violence, although it seems that most of it is gratuitous, and, of course, the acting is pretty good. The second half of this film is a bit more problematic. The screenplay is bad. It does not really make sense, nor does it really make a good story. The characters do not have a reason for their actions at the end of the movie. If the second half were really a continuation of the first half, it would have ended with some pretty intense violence and a very, very bad end to the movie (I didn't have a copy of the actual VHS, but a VHS tape of a slightly different, but similar, version of the same movie has been circulating around the net for quite a while). If you think that I am being overly negative about this movie, that is okay. It is a pretty bad movie, and it is really a shame that so many people are so quick to make a bad movie good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening of "Zootopia" is one of my favorite opening scenes ever. The characters are so cute and lovable. Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is very smart, courageous and brave. She always does what she thinks is best for the animals of Zootopia. And I love her because she can be all those things while also being very cute. I like that the animals on Zootopie never act crazy to each other. They're always trying to find the right answer. They don't think of themselves as a group of criminals. I love that there's a male bunny (a very wise, caring and funny fox) to make up the animal police force. I also like that at times, they are not just animals; they are like human beings.   This movie is one I want to watch over and over and be amazed by.  The movie is very funny and good to the ears. The acting is superb, and all of the animals look like their real selves.  A wonderful movie, great to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie in the theater with my mom, and we had a pretty good time, all things considered. For the most part, I was not too worried about the movie itself.  The special effects were good enough that you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the show and the movie.    The characters all played their parts fairly well.  I was most impressed with the scene where an old lady is looking at the new TV that has arrived in her home.  The opening scene of a new show and an old woman watching a TV with a good old fashioned sound track is sure to make a new viewer feel welcome.  I'm not sure whether this movie was intended as a parody or not, but it didn't really take much of a chance.  It is a very simple movie, but the characters in it are very realistic, and the film's ending is well thought out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great looking film for its time, with a good script that allows plenty of character development.  It's all in the setting.   It's a little town near Chicago, Illinois.  A few families live in the old house on the main street, and two children live next door to one of their neighbors.  They spend their days on the swing set and riding bicycles in the nearby fields.  When the kids are on the swings, and the swings are hot, the kids do some pretty wild stuff.  The mother,  Rose  (Mildred D. Wayne) is a former dancer who has recently lost her job at a circus because she has a bad back.  Rose has lived alone for some time, and is struggling to make ends meet as she tries to raise her two sons.  Her older son (Mark Wahlberg) is an only child.  He's more of a loner, which is understandable, as it's his father (Tom Hanks) who's the family patriarch.  There's a lot of tension between these two, as there is between all these dysfunctional people, and we have to see it all before it all blows up.  I found the characters and the actors to be really realistic, and they make their way through this crazy little town, which only has about a half dozen residents.  But the film is very light and lively, and it has a lot more to offer than just a crazy story.  And the acting is excellent.  If you get an opportunity to see this movie, do so. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man Who Wasn't There"  is not a great movie.  But, like most films in which you have to spend a lot of time wondering what in the hell is going on, the movie does have something.  It is the sort of oddity you see in horror movies when they are not being too realistic.  But you know what?  This is not a horror film.   The idea is weird, but if you let go and let it take you, it is a fun time.  A fun time indeed...a time of dancing and drinking and playing games and trying to figure out who these strange people are who are out to get you, and it all works so perfectly that you can not stop laughing your silly butt off and smiling at the screen.  This movie is not to be missed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To the very last moment there is an atmosphere of quiet and peacefulness in the woods.  At the moment of the shooting the sound of a car is heard as it's driven towards the scene of the massacre.  The police cars appear after that. The man is shot by a police officer who has his gun raised.  A few seconds later the policeman falls dead into the forest.  As the people of the village are running to the scene the police officer opens fire into the woods, hitting both of the girls who were walking on the road.  All that can be said for the movie is that it is well made and the characters were realistic.  It also had an interesting ending, something which is really out of the ordinary these days.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is really pretty good. Not a bad movie at all.

I was surprised how much I enjoyed the movie. I wish we got more movie like this.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm glad I found this film to be a little interesting. The main plot is about a girl named Kato who is working hard in her school to gain a few credits, and at the same time trying to make enough money to get her boyfriend to come back to her. But when she has to go on a one-year field trip, she is stuck with an idiot high school student named Takumi who doesn't even live there! Things quickly turn out to be more complicated than it first appears. I like it a lot because of the characters. I'm sure most people who are under 16 would rather not be spending a year living in the same house, but this is the way of things in Japan. I was wondering what the girl in the film was going to say after she realized that the guy who just left her is actually Takumi. I would've thought she'd come at him in a totally different way! I hope the girl doesn't fall in love with him just because of his face! This film isn't for the faint of heart. The setting, art and animation are all very nice, but the music is so bad it's almost as though they were made by a group of Japanese teenagers who had to turn a Japanese high school into a theme park during the summer. I really don't think I would ever go to Japan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good action movie, though I don't think it's a very original or a very smart movie. The film is about a boy who is forced to work at a junkyard while his father is off getting his master's degree, and while the son hates to do these types of things, he finally has to work there. The man who runs the junkyards is a brilliant scientist who has developed an extremely sophisticated machine that can pick up any kind of object thrown at it. It is a good thing that the boy's father isn't around to teach him the importance of this. In the meantime the boy takes a job working in the junks. He starts by using a special gun that shoots the object at the machine, and then he just uses his eyes. It's a really strange device but effective enough. The next day the inventor and his assistant arrive to pick up the boy and bring him to his lab. The assistant gives him a new gun and tells him that the "magic" machine would be perfect for this job, and with it he could earn a lot of money. The inventor, however, doesn't believe that boy and wants him to learn about chemistry instead. So the boy gives the assistant a small piece of something that looks like sugar to eat. It turns out that the machine uses a special material that dissolves sugar into water and that the thing is actually really dangerous. The invention gets ruined and the boy has to make it work properly again by using it on something else instead of sugar. I think the action and the story are the best parts in the movie, but there isn't much of that in the story, nor is there much of the science.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am sorry to be so blunt about this movie, but, yes, it is a good, if cloying, movie. It is a love story; the two are very nice, and they are not really the usual young men.   So it is quite strange that the film is not better, that is, if it is good at all.  The story is typical, and a bit cliched, too.  It is one of those films that have not a great deal of ideas; it tries too hard, and sometimes it's too clic...
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of times in the movies when a group of women goes to a party, it's as if the men didn't even show up.   Even in these films, the women make a decent showing, but not quite to the levels of the men in most of these films.  It really makes you appreciate the women of the world.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the end, a good old-fashioned, yet somehow still a little funny, thriller about a bad boy that is a big bully, who is a very good-looking man, a big jerk, who was very good in a movie he was in, and a good little movie (which has a special place in my mind with the great "Gone With The Wind" - it was a pretty good movie).

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie! It has a pretty low budget, but it really pulls it off. This was a good comedy. They were great to work with. The plot was awesome. There wasn't much dialogue, just funny conversations. You get to see how they got into the show, and the whole thing ends up in a cliffhanger. I just wish I had more of it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The director, Jafar Panahi, makes me laugh every time I hear his name.   It's a classic comedy that has been passed down through generations of filmmakers in Iran.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a few minutes, this movie makes you realize just how much a movie can teach one about how to deal with an emotionally disturbed person. As a result, the "drama" is really rather good.   If you are a person who loves to see and hear about the bizarre, this is a movie for you.  This movie is certainly not a great one, but it is entertaining, not the usual sort of "funny" stuff you find these days, but the sort of comedy which is so often the result of an extremely disturbed mind having the last laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a fine example of how a classic could be remade and still be good. I would not say it's the best film the studio has put out, but it is still a well made movie with an excellent cast and an exciting story line.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the better movies ever made, and certainly one of my favorite science fiction films.  I don't know why I didn't like the first movie more... it was just not the same.    There's an interesting plot going on in this movie: humans have created a way to manipulate gravity, and now a war is on between those who want to use it and those who don't (who would want to be left out of it).   One of the main characters in this film is the Chief Engineer of the space station that has been under the effects of the gravity-manipulation machine; he wants to get out of the project in a big way.  When the Space Station is in danger of destroying itself, he must get the Space Police to arrest the evil scientist who's manipulating the gravity.  His fellow crew members, especially the female scientist, are also trying to sabotage him.  I enjoyed it and hope that more people see it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was really looking forward to this movie. I had the opportunity to see it on the opening night of the Alamo Drafthouse in Dallas, Texas. Unfortunately, the movie was actually horrible. I have no problem with the fact that it was set in the past as many time travel movies are. In fact, the past is the greatest part of these movies. But this one really just wasn't very good. The acting was mediocre at best and the story was completely stupid. I would have rather seen a better film than this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be clear: this is a very good movie. It is really good that a movie like this could be made by one guy from New York City, one thing that's obvious to anyone who loves movies, especially those that take place on the street. Even though the premise is fairly goofy, the movie is funny enough to keep it entertaining for the duration of its run time. Some good actors work their characters in a very smart way. The music is decent, but not over the top. The story is very simple but interesting. In addition, the music and the acting are very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here's a good action movie from an up and coming producer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is set in a small rural Texas town that is overrun by the undead.  For a time there seemed to be a bit of hope that the zombies would be contained to a small local town, but a few years later the townsfolk start to die one by one.    At first this seems to be an allusion to a Stephen King story entitled The Dead Zone, and it is, sort of.  But the film takes a different path, instead focusing on the lives of a rural family that have been wiped out, the town's sheriff and the man who killed his wife.  It's not entirely clear what happens next, but it will probably shock you!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie, and liked this character in it so much I ended up reading his adventures into the future in my spare time. I also liked that he had a sense of humor about things, especially when they didn't go his way. The movie made a great impression on me when I first saw it. It was good, but not great. I think it would have been more memorable if I was able to see it in a theater, and I'm always impressed with the effects in those old movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film itself is a well-made comedy. It follows the typical "wanna-be actor" story: at 19 years old, after getting rejected by over two thousand shows, he goes to a school where a teacher is known as the "King of comedy". There the young actor tries to do anything and everything. He does not get an offer to play "King" but has a hard time being a regular student. He tries to make up for it by doing a "farting in a bath" and making a fool out of the "Head of School". There is no comedy at all in this film though. It is a slow, somewhat predictable piece of work, and a pretty good mess too. The actors all have the usual American-type stage personae and all the antics are quite old-fashioned. It never really grows on me, and I am glad I was not a young student when I first saw it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie about five years ago. I had heard about it a year or so before it came out on VHS. I liked it. It was a fun movie. I loved the whole idea of a kid becoming a professional wrestler and getting beaten up by an old school bully. The ending was kind of funny, though a little forced, and I didn't know how to feel about the idea of the wrestler going to school. I was kindof disappointed by this, though it is a pretty good movie. It's not a bad movie at all. I'm glad to see it again, and it's good enough to have a place on a VHS collection. I do wish the guy got killed in a great big explosion in the end, though. I love a good death.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you have ever seen a movie where a very beautiful young woman (played by a wonderful young Japanese actress (Tori Kimura) who is more than just pretty) is found to be murdered and the police find she had been strangled it means that one of Japan's most famous women has been found murdered. I mean really murdered. As in her own head was removed and then buried. This was in 1968 and the actress at the time was a rather unknown child actress called Yayoi Hasegawa who had never been a star in the United States and was the latest in a line of highly talented child actors brought to the States in the 60's by the famed producer, Frank Zappa (Zappa has always had a very odd taste in women and it can be heard in the background of a few of his records ). What is important about Yayo Hasei (and why she is probably to this day the best performing actress I have ever watched on screen) is that she was absolutely fearless in a way she never had been before and that she played the role of the tragic and beautiful child actress with a level of vulnerability and self-doubt that made a powerful and shocking performance.    And for many viewers, the most amazing thing about the film is the way that it manages to convey the fact that Yayor-Hasegawara is not merely a tragic woman, but a person who has achieved greatness.  The film has a very subtle and subtle irony in it. It is not about a girl's career but a young woman's coming of age in the early 70's. This is a film made for adults. It tells you at the beginning it's a movie about a young girl who is trying to figure things out and she makes many mistakes which she later realizes were mistakes (she is trying, but at a very young age and in the way she was raised in Tokyo, a city where "being a star is everything" is a very common way of thinking). However, she does not want to go back into her family's house and so she goes to see her sister. It turns out that she is not in fact dead but has just lost her sense of direction and she eventually goes to a park where her sister is sitting in a lawn chair and she asks her for directions to Tokyo.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm sure I've seen a number of classic black & white films over the years. One of the more memorable films from that era is this short movie that I saw many years ago. In this film, a young girl takes her friends to her first dance. The girl has little money so she decides to take a friend in tow to help her to dance. A great little short film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't watched this movie yet because I have the impression that it's not a good one and I'm not sure if I'm really supposed to. And when someone tells you that "A story of romance, murder, and betrayal, in which two men find themselves falling in love and then, by luck of the draw, end up in a deadly situation," you should listen to that and ignore any movie where the protagonists are always surrounded by women, because that ain't romance or mystery. But this is not romance or any of the other things I usually complain about. This is a movie with a very interesting plot and a story that's at least interesting on its own. It's more or less a historical retelling of the two famous murders committed by the Marquis de Sade in Paris in the late 17th century. Both victims in the first incident were men, but in the second there was a woman. I don't know a lot about this murder, but the story has me wondering, not really believing, but I wonder whether or not the Marquise De Sade was the real killer, or whether the other killers did it. One of the most interesting parts of the film is when the murder victim is presented for a public execution. The Marquis tells her he loves her, and then orders her to dance for him. She complies, and the Marquisen orders her executed. At the last moment a young woman runs up to the stage and screams at the Marquises for her sister's life. The story seems to say that all of the murder victims were executed together in the same room and everyone was happy with each other. The only problem is that not a single one of them has the names "Francoise, Maria, Elisabeth or Christine."  But this is a very French movie and a very funny movie, it's just that in order to be humorous it has to be serious.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm a big fan of horror films and I've seen some really cool ones. When I say that, I'm not just speaking metaphorically. This movie had great acting, interesting ideas, great effects and the fact that it actually made me laugh out loud was a treat. If you're looking for a good scare, then this is the one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a bad acid trip at a circus in the 1950's, and like the last one I went to the other night, "The Wizard of Oz" is, in my opinion, a really lousy movie.   (A great picture, by the way, which is why I went and saw it twice.)   It is probably only because it came out recently that I was able to see it.  This movie is, like the previous ones, a throwback to the old "The Wonderful Wizard of  Oz" movies of the 50's.  It uses an old school theme and sound, with great effects (including the "Oz" sound effects), good acting, and great music.  In fact, it's so good that I don't think the story is bad; it just has too many things missing, including the good old good Dorothy, and the Wizard of the West.  The film does have the usual cast of characters, which includes (in no particular order):   Alice (played by Dorothy)   - This is the daughter of Colonel Hap and, as a girl of about eleven, she is rather pretty and innocent, and a very nice girl, at any rate.  She is quite an idealistic person.  Her father, a very wise and very religious man, is an important figure in Oz.  He is the head of the Wizard's (and his army) of Oz. When Dorothy first sees the Wizard and the Wicked Witch, she can't really comprehend their power.  However, with a little help from her friends, Alice learns to understand the power of the Wicked.  As the film progresses, she comes to understand not only what the Wizard really is but the difference between good and evil.  Unfortunately, Dorothy comes to realize that the Witch can cause great harm to people as well.  After she tries to warn the citizens of Oz, she receives a warning that would come to haunt her throughout her life.  While I can't go into a huge amount of detail, I think the best thing about the movie is that it isn't a complete dud.  I loved it, and I hope to go to it again soon.  (The film may be available on DVD and blu-ray.)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There was a scene where a guy was being dragged by some guy's wife and kid (no, really, her kid) down the street after he tried to run away. The guy finally gets to the ground and tries to fight back, and the wife pulls out a handgun and shoots him dead. The poor guy never gets a chance to defend himself, and there's no blood, so, of course, there isn't even any blood on the floor. That's why they call it a "fist fight." This kind of movie was all over the place. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just loved this movie. It's a classic from one of my all time favorite filmmakers, William Lustig. It has a simple story, a great cast, and a unique director. And it's the type of film that everyone should see at least once. - September 3, 2011Great movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "In the early 90's, a small town, rural America has been overrun by an army of monsters. A strange phenomenon in the woods. A new breed of beast are emerging from the night. They attack with their bare hands, and then, they kill. A man named John Cusack (played by a young Tom Selleck) is the only person who can stop them. He knows they're only coming out at night. There's only one way to stop them, and that's for him to travel the night alone. He doesn't have a car, a gun or a flashlight, so he has to take whatever he can find with him from the town, so that he can get as much rest as he can. He's forced into living like a homeless man. But a strange thing happens. People come out of the night and start to attack him. He is able to defeat them, but the monsters are back and more of them are coming. And they're faster than ever. John Cussack is getting more and more tired and the nights are getting shorter. John has a plan to take care of the monsters. He can't afford the fuel to keep running his car. So he has no choice but to sleep out there. The only thing that will save him is if he can catch the monsters and capture them in a cage. If he doesn't, no one will be safe.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In an earlier entry I noted how the late, great David Cronenberg was, in addition to being one of the most original and brilliant filmmakers to have ever lived, an outstanding screenwriter.  Indeed, much of his best work (such as "The Dead") is so original, and so vividly realized, that one might be forgiven for thinking that he was a filmmaker rather than a novelist.    In the case of "The Fly," this is certainly true, but not simply because it is a fantastic piece of writing about a fantastic creature, which is as good an explanation as any.  One may think of it as a combination of a "Citizen Kane" for the early years of World War II, and a sort of "Breathless" for post-Vietnam years.  For Cronenberg, as for most film critics, a bad movie is a bad film, and by "bad" I mean "so bad that it is hard to imagine anyone watching it and not thinking: 'If I had to do this again, I'd do it differently.'" This is certainly what happens to our hero, the fly.  He's a pretty typical character in the early part of the movie, when we first meet him in his house.  It's an empty house, as usual, the sort of house that you never really want to see, and it seems to be the exact sort of place where someone would go to get away from trouble.  However, as he goes into the garage, and begins to talk to an old man who is walking around there, it is clear that something is not quite right.  His house is so neat and tidy that it's hard to believe this old guy is there, so it's not much of a surprise when the old man disappears under the floorboard.  As it happens, the old guy was there just moments before the old fly moved in, but he doesn't seem to be doing a lot of talking or even looking directly at the fly...  It turns out that this fly is actually the ghost of a soldier who had been killed by another fly before being taken prisoner of war.  What we see is a very clever way of conveying what a bizarre situation the fly finds himself in: a world in which, for some reason, flies are not allowed in the house. The old soldier, though apparently dead, lives on in a sort-of limbo, which we soon discover is all too real
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a huge fan of The Rocketeer, and I thought this was an awesome spin on a classic movie.  The Rock-a-Thon was a blast, and the film was a fun romp through the early days of the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame, with The Beatles, The Beach Boys, The Byrds, The Mamas and The Papas, The Who, and all kinds of other cool rockers.   As mentioned, this was my first experience with The Rock'N'Roll Hall Of Fame (which is located in Anaheim, California) and I will definitely be coming back to see this one again.  Mama Cass was very cool. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the first time that I have ever seen a classic movie. I'm not saying that this is the best of the classic movies. It's just so good that I would watch it again if the title weren't so long, but, hey, this is an old movie and we all know that no one likes to see a movie that's too good to be true. I have to say that I loved the movie. It has a very classic feel to it. It reminds me of my childhood, watching this movie and getting all worked up about the "villains". They all feel more like a comic book than a movie. As a kid, I couldn't relate to them at all. They are the evil ones! Even when the movie is about the innocent characters, it's still funny. There are a few cliches and the music seems to get even worse. But as a kid it was good. And it's good for adults as well. The only reason why I gave this a 3 instead of a 4 or 5 is because of one of the best scenes in a movie; "I Was Born for This" has a great punchline about people who don't know when to quit. I'd like to know the writer(s) of this movie! It's been 30 years and I haven't seen it. I would like to see more. I'll probably watch it when it comes back in theaters this summer. - August 8, 2002The best of a bad movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We've never seen anything quite like this movie: the most unique of the "Sofia the First" movies, it's a hilarious tale of a girl that's raised by wolves, her father, who is the strongest one of them all. One day, after she's grown into an adult, she meets a man who calls himself a vampire, who offers her a special treat: a human face. The woman is so captivated that she accepts and soon has a human-like face, but unfortunately it doesn't last. Soon she becomes a vampire and ends up killing her boyfriend in a jealous rage and starts to live again as a human.  It's an entertaining but very odd movie, a story about a girl who's raised as a wolf and a man that has a special cure for her, and so on.  The ending is somewhat confusing to me.  It could have been a little more subtle, but at the same time I really liked it.    - Reviewed by Rianne 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Curtis Hanson (Dwight Yoakam) is a small time mob boss. He has two sons, one of whom has a very large nose. One day in the middle of a bad week, a truck full of people crashes in front of the Hanson's mansion. Curtis' son has a gun and Curtis' wife is killed in the shooting. One of Curtis' grandsons, a boy about the same age as his father, is also killed. This leads to Curtis becoming a mob boss to pay off the debts of his family. In one scene the older man with the big nose decides he's going to be a big man. He cuts a bloody hand across the belly of a man who was in the truck and tries to squeeze the life out of him. A shot rings out and the older boss is hit in the eye. The older man falls off the tractor to the ground and the truck driver crawls out to look for him. Curtis picks up the truck, goes to a nearby gas station, and buys a large knife. He decides to take the life of his enemies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie with a bad ending.   The movie does not start bad. We get a brief glimpse into the life of a young man who is looking to live the good life, having a few beers at a bar with a few mates. One of the men in the group has a penchant for stealing things. While the others are on the dancefloor, he's looking through a purse while talking to a woman who seems to be a womanizer. After the guy leaves, a young lady, played by Sandra Bullock, shows up. When he learns that she is a prostitute, he is intrigued. He decides to take her on a tour of some of the local prostitutes where she introduces him to some of her clients. After a while, the young man returns to the bar, where he is immediately confronted by a few of the young girls and tells them he's on his way. However, it soon becomes obvious that there is more going on than meets the eye. It isn't long before the other women start to show up. One is a young mother, played with much gusto by Toni Collette. The others are the daughters of various local men. Soon, the group is all of a sudden swamped by a police investigation. The men are forced to tell all their stories while being grilled on who has the women and who is selling them for sex. Written by John Sacksteder <jsackste@bellsouth.net>

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been wanting to see this film since it came out so long ago. Now that I'm old enough to see it I was surprised to see that this movie is no longer running, but I'm glad they kept it around. I still enjoy it. It was very, very different then the movies of the 70s (the one's that were filmed in the 60s and 70s). This was a movie that had a unique style that was totally different. You could see the film as if you were looking through a peephole into an alternate reality (or perhaps just another version of reality), or at least it was supposed to. It also had a lot of violence and very, VERY interesting and interesting creatures (the aliens and monsters that were also the main characters). This film also didn't try to be something that it wasn't. In fact, it was really interesting to see a movie where aliens came from outer space to invade our earth. The movie also had one of the most iconic music scenes that you have ever heard in any movie that has ever been made. It's probably the single best music scene that has been made in a movie. I'm still not sure if I'll ever see this movie again (I did once see it before it went out of circulation in the 70's), but that doesn't bother me. I will always remember it. I don't see anything wrong with watching one of those sci-fi films from the 70ies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A movie like this must have a good story to be entertaining, and it does so beautifully with a story that is more about the characters and their motivations and their own lives than it is about a single battle. The story starts in the middle of the Civil War with a young officer named Billy Jenkins trying to get his new regiment into fighting shape after he was injured in a freak accident. As the story goes, Jenkins and a fellow soldier (a young sergeant named Henry) start to make the best of their new situation when they run into some trouble. This is a movie that has a wonderful cast of characters and it's a good time to be a fan of old westerns, with a little extra spice added in for good measure! Watch it today! Posted by Michael W.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When a movie gets a bit out of hand at its end, you might need to rewind a couple of times, just to see if everything makes any sense. This was one of those movies. It is a simple, funny, well-paced film, in which one of my favorites of all time plays the villain. The movie has the same basic format: A bad guy who wants to kill a bunch of innocents gets caught in a routine traffic accident. He is then rescued by a cop, who convinces him to go to a movie theatre and get killed. In other words, the movie is a comedy. And yet, the final scene was just plain awful. First of all, I must mention that this was the first Hollywood action film to feature a guy with a gun. There are plenty of bad guys around in Hollywood, of course, but none so bad, so evil, so completely inept, that they are so ridiculous that it is hard to believe them. Yet in the final shot of the movie, we see a guy dressed up in full Batman costume, pointing a gun at the screen. Is this all that Batman has achieved? A movie which ends with an ineptly acted scene in a movie theater? There are many more such movies out there, but this one ranks up there with the worst.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the second time I am watching this.  When I first saw this movie I thought the actors were just playing "pretend" that it was a movie.  They were just imitating people talking to other people at a party.  I do not understand how some people can take this movie seriously.   I never understand how people watch something that is a comedy and think that it is a serious drama.  What the film does is take everything that makes the sitcoms so popular from the 90s and add in some "bad" stuff.  The cast really are all pretty good.  A lot of people don't like these "soulful" shows.  But they should.  If you liked The Drew Carey Show you should like this one.  It is a good mix of laughs and emotions.  This movie is not "good" or "bad", it is just entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be fair to the original movie from 1984, it did have some interesting elements in it. A lot of the time though there was little to no interest in the plot. The movie wasn't very good, especially not in the ending. If you have any interest in sci-fi movies, you're bound to like this one. The character of Jack "The Bear" (George Coe) is a nice enough guy. He's a lot like the original Jack from The Goonies and even though the movie doesn't go quite that far, we feel for the character. We all wish we could be a little more like Jack. The special effects in the movie are pretty cool and the special effects are a little overdone here and there. I like the music in the background of most of the film. It's great in the beginning but then the music gets a little repetitive. There are some pretty good special effects on screen and the actors all work well together. As always, The Goons is a good time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Babe Ruth plays the bad guy in "The Drowsy Chaperone" (1920), a film that was made just at the beginning of the silent era, before the advent of sound film.  The Drowsy Chaperones are a pair of vaudeville performers who have to make it through the night at a seedy hotel.    When they do, they can't get enough of the action on the stage and one of the performers, a pretty pretty little woman (it's not clear if she's a male or female) takes her turn at the drowsy chaperone role.   When all is said and done, the girl's performance is not much, but the action in the movie is rather good and when they get to the end there isn't anything else to do but show the drowsy chaperones off to the crowd.   It's not really a very good movie and a good example of a silent movie in the 1920's, but if you want to see a good silent movie with pretty pretty pretty young actresses playing drowseies then you might as well see "The Chaperleones."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think that The Green Mile is a terrific movie, and it's got a great ending that I am still shocked by.  It's about an old man (played by a really good Richard Gere) who dies in a freak accident.  His family is really poor and his son is sick and can't get a job at the town pool so they live in a decrepit old house in a poor section of town and that's how we got the title of the movie.  Richard Gery makes a very good old man and we get to know him well and we also get to see the town through his eyes.  The movie has a very nice sense of pace and the pace is good through out, even when Richard is doing things in his wheelchair.  I especially like the way that it keeps the action happening at night in a pretty grim and depressing town, something that is not often seen in westerns.  This movie will bring a smile to your face.

I don't think it's ever actually been very good, and it's never really been good. It just sort of happened to get made in a way that made its badness so obvious. It made it clear what kind of movie it was: a comedy with a pretty, pretty girl on the title card. It doesn't feel like a movie; it feels like a cartoon. And if this movie doesn't make any sense at all, I don The movie: (I just wanted to add the obligatory scene from the ending, to remind you that it's in the movie!)  I was in high school, back in the early 1970s. We were all teenagers in a pretty good mood, since we had just moved away from the oppressive heat of Chicago. The high school we had moved to was actually on a hill and the entire area had been flattened. Not even the trees could grow there anymore. There was a little park, but that looked like it would be hard to keep it alive any longer. Well, the little park was not going to do it, so the school was going to have to be moved to a much steeper place. We all got a nice group of friends, some of whom were my age, and we decided to move there. It didn't take long to find a way to get ourselves out of the park.  First, it was decided that there would be an open house for some new buildings. I suppose I should mention that the entire building was to be an air-raid shelter; and the doors would open outwards from the roof.  We thought that would be funny.  At any rate, this was going on at the same time that my sister and I decided to do something to show our respect for our elders. As a matter of fact, we went to the school, and one of the first things we did was to buy us a bunch of old, old-fashioned books of a somewhat religious nature:   St. Catherine's    and   St. John Neumann's  The Stigmata of Christ.   We thought that this would be a fitting tribute to our school leaders, a kind of memorial service.   But when I found out that we didn't actually have to pay to get into the open house,

This movie has a real sense of humor, with the story being told through a combination of a "Saturday morning cartoon" and a "cute cartoon" in which the lead characters (one is a boy with pink hair, who doesn't believe in Santa Claus) all get into some mishaps. The characters are so sweet and endearing that it's easy to just watch them and smile at the end.

There is plenty of it in this film, with most scenes being filled with it. This is done to add to the tension, and it works well.     The only complaint I can have about this film (besides it being too old for me - so let's see if it was ever good!) is that the opening credits sequence is so over the top. It's ridiculous, and the dialogue is so loud and so overblown. I suppose the intent was to make the movie sound like a foreign film - and it does that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If I had to sum up the whole thing up in a few words, it would be: "Dude, don't do drugs." It's that simple.  The premise is that of a drug dealer trying to get rich off of a new drug called "Lobster Brain." The Lobster Brain seems to be something that is very closely related to the effects of drugs in the early days of the drug war (see: A Clockwork Orange ). You have to get the drugs from the CIA so that they can put them in Lobster brain (which looks like a lobster's brain). Lobster brains are very hard to get, and they aren't selling at all. The CIA makes sure that these lobsters don't get eaten by the animals. So it's up to the guy who has to smuggle the drugs into the CIA (and is played by Benicio del Toro). It's a good premise and the acting was solid. There were a lot of drug dealers in the movie and they're all the same type: The ones who only want a good time and to feel better about themselves.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a good book, "R.I.P.," a brilliant and sad drama about a beautiful young man, is a tale of a young man's search for identity in the face of his tragic, mysterious death. The film takes us with the lead character, played by the wonderful, talented Christopher Walken, on a journey through a series of beautiful Italian towns, from Florence to Milan. As he drives through the winding roads and beautiful countryside, we sense the melancholy in the young man and the sadness that follows when he returns to the U.S. where he lives with his mother and uncle. A friend of his uncle's, a young woman named Mary Ann (played wonderfully by Tia Carrere) has been asking for a chance to meet and talk to him, which he refuses, as she is too ugly to be his real mother. As she becomes more depressed, we feel her isolation and desperation. But then comes the fateful day he meets the beautiful, sad woman who later becomes his wife. They go through a brief courtship, with Walken as her paramour and a brief sex scene, and she marries Walken. The world of his new life is full of tragedy and tragedy, as his new family, his friends, his lover, his neighbors are all aghast at the man they have brought into their lives. However, Walken is not at all happy about his new role in life. What he is able to cope with and deal with, is the sadness of his life. He does what he can to deal with the tragedy, which is the pain of losing his wife and his son, and the loneliness of the American family he found in this new life.

The book was more of a thriller, which made me wonder how I would get through the movie. I was wrong. The movie is excellent. The story is told in a combination of real and surreal elements. Some characters are almost realistic; a few are very realistic. The film has a very strong social point of view. The characterisation is excellent, and while some characters are a little silly, they are never mean-spirited. They are just different. I liked this film more than The Last Unicorn, which I loved. It doesn't matter if the characters are realistic or ridiculous; I liked all of them. I have a small collection of surreal French film-noir, and I think this is among the best ones.

There is a doctor at the local hospital who, upon hearing about a young man missing for several days, goes out to look for him. On the way there he meets a beautiful woman named Lucy. Her name is Eve and she has been gone from home for a while and her father suspects that the cause is Eve's secret.  She has been in a terrible and terrible situation. She is married to someone named Joseph, and he has been unfaithful to her in such a way that she has given birth to four children. Unfortunately, Joseph is a drunk and can't take care of the four. The only person who can look after them is Eve.  One of the daughters has a secret, as do the four children, and all have secrets.   I like how these are each represented by a different color.    You get a little glimpse of Lucy and Joseph's marriage and the family's secrets. This is really something to see on a big screen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're a big fan of action movies, then you've come to the right movie. The first part of the movie takes place in the fictional "United States" - a place of great wealth, culture, and beauty - which is surrounded by the ocean.   The film opens with a young girl, played by the brilliant, young Elizabeth Banks, who has just been picked up by a big guy with a gun.  This man then proceeds to rape the girl and the rest of her friends, while laughing and dancing.  At this point, the viewer's emotions start to run wild.  Even the "bad guy" seems like a joke, as he just rapes and kills people.  Banks and her friend soon get rescued by a pretty nurse.  The nurse tries to save the girl, but the big guy comes back and kills her.  Her friend, still wearing the sexy nurse outfit, then falls victim to another gang of thugs.  When she tries to escape, she's shot by the big thug in a wheelchair.  After this, the big bad guy escapes.  In the end of the film, there's some good laughs as the film comes to its very end.  It's the perfect movie to show to someone who isn't a big action fan. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be quite blunt about it, if you are not a big fan of the 80's or love comedy, this movie has all the ingredients for a hit but the film itself isn't very good and most importantly the ending left a bad taste in my mouth after viewing it. But at least it was an entertaining ride to watch and it was nice to see the old school 80's comedies with all their great lines.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has the potential to become one of the greatest movies of all time if only it was a little more interesting.    The story is good, but the directing is just about the worst it's ever been.  It is simply an excuse to put a lot of shots on the screen, but those shots are poorly aimed and just all look like a bunch of stuff tossed together on a whim in a studio.  In one particularly stupid scene, there is a buncha men running around at night, and then the camera zooms in on a man on a high-heeled stiletto with a bad, terrible smile on his face.  I'll bet that the filmmakers spent the whole film trying to shoot scenes like that.  There's not much else to say about this movie. It is just a bunch o' crap.  The music is also pretty lousy, even by 1970 standards.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I'd like to add that the movie is quite funny. It's like a comedy version of the Star Wars trilogy. And that's really all I can say about it.  I don't think the movie ever really hits it's stride until the third act. For about a half hour it's good, but then everything goes to hell. The script is badly written and the characters are extremely stupid.   The script does little to entertain me. It all seems extremely stupid and poorly thought out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a pretty good movie, in the worst ways possible. It made me very sad to see the old movies which were on tv all the time. One of the great movie actors is there (James Franciscus), however he has been too much in over his head lately and hasn't been able to get any work in recent years. I am sure I would like to see more of this wonderful actor. I think this is one of those times where you see this movie at a time and if you don't care about the movies you shouldn't bother seeing the film anyway. It is really not that great of a movie, but I know it's good. If you don' like sci-fi, don't like space, don' want to see a movie about space, space, or a planet in space, then DON'T watch this movie, it might change your life!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like movies about robots who play chess and break the law, you'll like this.  The plot: A computer program has been created that plays chess as well as a human, and it wants to win the match against his best rival, a human. Unfortunately, his computerized opponent refuses to play the game, instead preferring to bluff.    And so it's the human who has to resort to using his human brain to see through the computer's moves, and so the program plays the perfect game. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a simple and pretty good movie, not a good action film in the traditional sense (though it has its moments) but for a little girl to be so determined to rescue her doll (the only one with "powers") is quite an achievement.  The film is in black and white and does the impossible: it moves with a sense of humor and without the usual "action movie" conventions.  I saw it a few days ago and the young girl in the "fear of losing her doll" phase had moved on to a more "normal" life.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story goes that when I was a kid I saw this movie as a child, and I remember feeling a mixture of sadness and excitement about it. It was probably the first movie I watched that truly showed a man (the hero of the movie) going back to be with his father (the villain) to try and right his wrongs from the days of war. I loved the movie and would recommend it to all people with feelings of nostalgia.  "The King's King and the King's Man" (1956) Directed by: Elia Kazan
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie that's worth watching is worth watching in spite of the title.   What does it have going for it?   First off:  In no way is this a rip-off of The Breakfast Club or American Gigolo.  It is an original idea and is funny, very funny.  This is about a poor kid from Kansas who ends up in a bar where everyone is a millionaire, with the exception of his mother.  In fact, he is living with his mom and his old pal, an Italian cowboy.  The old guy who he's friends with is a tough guy.  I'd say he's about 30-something at the most and is really a tough old thing.  When he starts acting like this all of a sudden the bartender goes all pouty and gets all hot and bothered about the kid.  What an odd couple he's got, but that's not the most surprising thing. This is the story of a guy who's got a girlfriend who he meets at a carnival.  He thinks she's just really sexy, because even a woman like her is attractive with or without clothes.  Well, it doesn't get much better than that.  At some point, a guy named "Johnny" comes up to the girl and is impressed.  Then he's not, because in the middle of the night, when he's really, really drunk, he drops the girl off a building.  So, he doesn't have a girlfriend, but he does have a friend named "Tony", who has a girl he likes.  And the girl has a boy named "Eddie" who is the son of a rich guy.   Now what happens?  Here comes the classic story.  Eddie is a good guy, but doesn't realize it, until he meets a girl named "Brigid" who looks just like him.  "E" is a loner, and doesn't know much about anybody, but at the same time he's pretty good-looking (and a bit on the funny side).  The whole thing is very silly.  But in my opinion, that is what makes it so good.  There's nothing worse than watching a movie and just getting a punchline, as it's not much of a joke.  However, The Breakfast club or American gigolo don't get a look in.  You're just supposed to laugh.  Now, it's got
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only thing I thought was bad about this movie were some of the shots. It reminded me of some of those old VHS tapes that I used to get from time to time, and those shots looked like they were shot on a video camera. This movie was not bad at all. Some of the actors were doing a good job playing all the roles, and all the scenes were well done.   If you enjoy films from the 80's, or you just want to see some good action in a well-acted movie, you should definitely check this movie out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you think "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" is just a sequel to  The Force Awakens, you haven't seen anything yet! In fact, the  Last Jedi  is set a long time before those movies and brings to life all those characters you know and love. The action is fast-paced and the characters really shine through. The best thing about this movie is that you get to see these characters for the very first time since the last one.   In the end of the Last Jedi, they have returned.  I can't believe there's a new movie in the galaxy!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am so happy to finally get out of the country. I was hoping to come here at least once while in Vancouver for the Vancouver Film Festival, but due to the weather and the long travel I didn't bother. I'm not quite as familiar with the films here as I am in Europe and America, but overall I really enjoyed myself. If you enjoy movies about the rich and famous, then you will love this one. I will try and see what else is going on for the rest of the summer so that I can watch more films. One other thing I'm pretty sure I will like as well is the fact that all of the actors are very funny. It's obvious this is one of the best comedies of the year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An amazing historical piece of cinema, and in a genre that has so many great films, this is truly one of the best.   Written by Alan Parker and starring Richard Attenborough, Michael Redgrave and Brian Cox, this film deals with how the Roman Empire became one of most successful empires in the world.  It begins as a movie about warring factions fighting over territory in the south of the empire, the film then focuses on a small group of Roman emperors in the north, and the rise of the Empire to greatness.  A great historical film to watch on a chilly winter's day.  Recommended for history lovers  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The most entertaining film I saw in 2016! Not only will the movie make you laugh, it is also a good film to watch over a long-endurance beer. I do recommend that you don't expect too much out of the film because it is very well-made, but you'll feel like your sitting in the driver's seat of a hot rod!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    To be honest i have not really watched this film much, maybe because i heard it was made by a director with only 3 films in his oeuvre. However that is not the case. The film has a great plot and the action is very good. This is a good horror film with very great performances.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie about a person with a bad conscience who is constantly finding himself in the wrong places. Written by Andrew I. Miller for a small screen company that was planning to make a few movies and the script caught their eye. I think Miller had to be very careful to ensure that the scripts were good. This is very hard to do in a low budget film. Miller was a good storyteller, and he had to find ways to keep the actors from getting bored and the audience from turning the film off too quickly. I really enjoyed this film. It made me think about how I would behave in those circumstances. It was funny, and the characters were engaging. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When this movie came out (or a year later, in fact), it was a pretty good movie. It is a period piece set in London about the first World War. There is also a period romance between a British and an Irish girl. The music is great and I love that the actors play a few songs as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As it's title suggests, "The Longest Way" focuses on a woman who runs a hotel in the mountains of Switzerland. While she is there, she gets involved in a love triangle, which has the effect of turning her into something of a romantic lead. But once that gets going, the drama of the film turns into a comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is called "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang". And I mean it to literally bang: the first minute of it is a lot of random, incoherent action, with the entire movie being a mess of unoriginal ideas. The movie moves so fast that in about half an hour, there's no plot (the whole movie moves like a blur). This has to be one of the most ridiculous movie titles ever, and yet I can't find anything bad about it. The animation is pretty good, and all the characters have pretty good personalities. A funny thing about this movie is that all the different musical acts seem to be in the movie at the same time, which makes it all the more hilarious. There are a couple of references to other movies I'd forgotten about, like "The Three Stooges" and "The Sting". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is well-acted, well-directed, and well-edited. It is probably the best film of its kind I have seen, or so far. I like the idea of this film. It involves two children, a father and a daughter. The father is kind to the daughter, and very loving to the son. His daughter (who looks about 13 or 14) is very pretty. But the mother is mean and bitter, and the father is very loving, but too kind and too loving at the same time. The two children are not happy together. It seems to me that one of them (my father's son, played by Edward Douglas, is kind and gentle) and the other (my mother, played with much more depth by Louise Brooks) are being punished for some perceived fault of the other. I think this is the best-made movie I have ever seen, and so far it is without a doubt the best of its type.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A well-directed, yet slightly disappointing movie. I think a more interesting story line would have been the film's goal. The film is filled with funny characters, a well-played story line (I think the climax is the movie's most satisfying) and a beautiful soundtrack (the only thing that can make me laugh about the film is when all the characters are in the kitchen talking about how much they love each other - which, honestly, is pretty funny). I enjoyed watching these characters interact with each other and laugh - and I also found myself laughing at the same time, though there were a few moments that were a bit too long and drawn out for my taste. This movie would have benefited from a shortening of the story, a slightly more humorous character (though I really liked those actors too), an interesting story or two, and, possibly, an expansion of the cast. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the words of the movie "this was the beginning of a very fun adventure, where the good looking woman meets up with a man who is very different to the other gentlemen".  The character of the man changes constantly and changes from being a nice and harmless man into an aggressive man.  Somehow the movie manages to make a movie in which the character changes completely over the course of the films running time.    The story of the two characters has a lot of humor to it and the women seems to be the main characters.

It's a wonderful film and you've got to see it to be convinced. I'd love to see a new film by Spielberg every year or so - he's so talented. I'm sure it'll be just as good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are many reasons why a movie about a young boy's trip through space, in which he meets his parents for the first time, is so interesting, interesting even for non-space people: the acting is superb, the story is exciting and full of wonder, the music is excellent, the pictures are excellent. There's just nothing but good about it. I also thought it was very funny, very funny - the way a tiny, white spaceship is blown up to the size of a mountain as it flies past a town on the moon, the way it is shown being swallowed by a planet as it passes it, the ways it can't see the earth, the fact that it takes off at night in the middle of the night... it's a fun movie. But there are certain aspects which I didn't quite like, such as the way the character of the son is treated - he is shown as very young and helpless - and there was a lot of humour in it, but I didn;t always get the impression that it was in good taste. (It was in the 70s, I think)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It seems the more we learn about the CIA's top secret MK-ULTRA program, the more the CIA tries to keep it secret. A couple of decades after the CIA started MK-Ultra in the 1950s and started running its mind control experiments on unsuspecting citizens, it appears the program has been "saved" by the film director Oliver Stone. The movie is a "must" for any MK-ultra enthusiast, and for anyone who feels that their government might be doing some really terrible things in the name of research and/or "national security". Stone uses the story of Dr. Josef Mengele, the "Angel of Death", to describe the CIA programs that continue to this day. The film contains the usual MK-lame claptrap about "evil aliens", the "clash of civilizations", and other nonsense. In the end, the movie ends up showing the absurdity of the CIA MK-trials. I would have hoped that with the exposure of the film, more people would be able to see the reality of the programs and the absurdities of the government's position, but instead it is more likely that MK-ults is going to keep on doing what it's been doing for 70 years.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like a lot of the movies I watch in this genre. It's a little disjointed to say the least, but I enjoyed it. The only problem with it is that the characters didn't have as much time to develop as I'd have liked. The main character is too young to feel mature, especially if he's a kid. He acts like the character he is in the movie, but he's only 15. I think he's 15 because he looks that age, but his age is supposed to be 19 so he's still only 10 years old. He was a kid in high school when we first saw him. There were times when he had to take care of other kids in the class who were in trouble and didn't really know what to do. At one point, he was told to let a kid get hit by a bus because the kid wasn't really injured, but we don't really see the kid get hurt and we only see his father talking to him because his parents don't speak English so he has to help. The movie is supposed the kid's first real trip to the U.S., and he does a lot to earn the respect and the friendship of those he encounters there. He's a pretty good actor. I can see why they cast him. I didn't feel like they went out of their way to make a good film about a foreigner trying to do an American job.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first act was the greatest I have seen in a while, which is saying something for a horror movie made during the 60s.   One of the most powerful scenes came as John Wayne played the role of a crazy doctor who was trying to help his own son who was stuck in the attic of a house in a strange, dark, stormy night.  It was so effective that, a few minutes later, the film had already found its voice.  I always thought that there was something going on in the background when I watched horror films, but it's still quite shocking watching a scary movie and watching it for the first time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good example of what a well-acted film is. It's just a good story and the actors do their job well.  There's nothing wrong with the film in any way.  It is a low-budget film with no special effects.  The cast is small and most of the time they don't get much to do.  I'd say this is the best of the low-cost films and the cast is good.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best part of this movie is its atmosphere. The first part of this movie was almost unbearable; the cinematography was dreadful, and I got a feeling that it was a movie where there should not have been any actors. But at the same time, I was looking forward to watching the second half of the film.   This is not a bad movie by any means. It is a movie about a group of criminals that steal something from a store, and then they murder the owner of the store and go on their way.  It seems that everything is just like in the movie I described above: It is all just a routine robbery that is interrupted at every moment. I do not know why someone would steal from a convenience store and then murder his owner when there is so much money in the store. But as always, I thought that the film was good enough to make up for my dislike of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is possible that one of the finest movies ever made has been lost.   It has taken the place of a very interesting play and a film about the first lady, but it does not come as a surprise to anybody familiar with the film, for it is a most interesting one and the most exciting one, I believe.  The film is the only one in which the great director, Sergei Eisenstein, has not himself been at the movie but is only responsible for the music; it is only his most famous work.  One of the most striking points in the film is that it was made before the world war, it does contain a scene or two, which are very characteristic, it will be seen that Eisenstein does not limit himself to the present. There are some scenes which are not in the theatrical version but in the silent version and Eisenstein never really thought of abandoning them.  Eisenstein is known as an artist for simplicity and it is clear that he is always trying to make movies which can be understood and liked by a modern audience.  I have not seen any film in which Eisenstein has so much fun, which seems to be the case with this one.  If anyone was interested in the work of Eisenstein as an art artist, they will be delighted to see a film which is so interesting and with which they are all familiar. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have a problem with most "horror" films from the 90s and early 2000s.  I watched this before I was even born!  The plot is so dumb:   Mary (Rita Wilson) is a newlywed at her new home in rural Florida with her husband Charlie (Ray Wise).  Mary gets sick and the only explanation she can come up with is that a deer with a molar had come and eaten some sort of fungus off her plants.  Charlie and Mary decide to try to find the deer.  Mary sets off in a car which gets stuck in a snowdrift (don't ask).  She gets out with an ax in her hands but when she starts cutting the vegetation she runs into the deer and loses it.  Eventually, she can't stand it any longer and tries to kill it....    That's all I've got.   The acting is generally terrible, the acting is the acting, even the acting was bad.  One of the best movies I ever saw and one of the funniest comedies ever made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's about time.  That was like ten years ago that this movie was released.    What a movie this was, it was very entertaining, it had good fight scenes, there was some nudity, sex scenes and it was well made, but there was no real story behind this movie.  I mean, why would they go to a country in the middle east and kill everyone in it to prove some thing or another?  There was no big event, it just was something that happened in a way that made you think this story wasn't meant to be a story.  And what story does it have?  The plot is that a person named Abner is a preacher, and that he travels around the area looking for people who are trying to get rid of witches and evil spirits.  Well, he does the old "spend time in the woods", "get a magic knife", "go to church" and all the usual stuff that he always does.  So the first person Abner comes across is a man named Jett.  Jett is a wizard, a magician, and it turns out that he is trying to find his lost daughter.  But when Abner catches him, Jett reveals to him that he's trying to hide the witch that he used to own.  After a chase and a fight, Abner finds out that Jett has a lot of power to cast spells on people and is also capable of making himself invisible.  Then, they fight, and as usual, Abners magic knife causes a lot more trouble than Abner's magic.  He finds himself being chased by other wizards and Jett, who is able to take Abner to different places at will.  This movie is very fast paced, and Abner gets caught up with some very big things.  Sure, the ending was a little weak, and I feel it would've been better if the story was actually about Abner finding out who Jett really is and why he is the way he is.  Other then that, the movie had a lot fun, and there was enough nudity and sex to keep the movie interesting.  It might be worth a watch, if you're a fan of a little horror movie that is good enough for a good laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film opens with a series of oddball images that don't quite sit right: the girl walking with a man behind her; a woman sitting in the middle of a field, surrounded by an orange grove; a black man (Ricky Jay) driving a truck and waving at the camera. In the middle is an old man (Teddy Long) in a wheelchair sitting at a table eating a bowl of oatmeal; a blond woman (Lorraine Hansberry) walks past; a young woman (Rita Hayworth) and a child (Sammy Davis Jr.) play in the fields; there are old timers who can still pull off tricks; a truck pulls up to a stop; a small dog, possibly named Gidget, is barking nearby.   We get a look at a scene where a girl with long hair (Julia Roberts) takes off her jacket and walks to a door with a door handle labeled "R" with a red stripe. In this room is another girl (Lori Kay), who turns out to be a very young actress playing a woman who is trying to steal a car. The two girls meet up at the door; the woman walks through the door, pulls out a knife and cuts the girl's hair. After that, we get a few shots of a girl playing with a toy truck.   the girls are talking about things that don`t seem to be important at the moment: how different the weather is now; how many cars are in her neighborhood; how old people act; how different they are from today's teens. When they are interrupted by someone knocking at the front door, we find out that this is a kidnapping; the old man takes the girl to a motel in a dark alleyway. There are two other girls who are in the same situation and are also told that they are going to be kidnapped. After the third girl returns home, we go to a bar where two men are watching. At the bar, there is a fight that ends with one man stabbing the other in the back. He goes home and we see the same girl as before who was not harmed in the fight. When the third guy returns, he tells the bartender about the fight and shows him a picture of the girl. When he leaves, he calls the police. They are called immediately and they go to the girl`s home. We go to this old man`s house, which has no electricity, running water or running gas
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't remember the last time I saw a really good sci-fi film where the special effects really work.   This is probably my favorite of the three.  This film has an interesting plot which I'll discuss later.  It seems to be based on a true story about a man who, in the 1940s, was the first person to build a time machine that could travel through space in a matter of hours. He worked on the machine for three years and then put it in storage and forgot about it. It was only when a friend of his, Robert Langdon, who was running a small airline, came to town that he noticed the time machine and contacted it. Langdon took the time to go out and get it and then returned to California with it.  Unfortunately, his friend decided that the time travel aspect wasn't worth spending three years working on and abandoned the project. In the summer of 1948 Langdon bought the time-machine from the local Salvation Army and decided to use it on a road trip, hoping to visit the North Pole (it was in August so he was hoping to go by way of Siberia, but there were no trains, so it was all downhill from there).  Unfortunately for him he never made it to the North pole and the machine crashed. Langdaon didn't die, but he and the time ship became separated.     As the story goes, after many years, and the help of the time traveler Langdaan, who has become an alcoholic, who wants to spend his time on the road, Langdaen finds himself stranded in the year 2012 and needs to find a way to get back to his own time (something he had no memory of).   The plot is rather interesting; it is a good mix of science fiction and time travel and the movie is interesting to watch.  The time travel element comes into play fairly early in the movie when Langdae travels from his past to the present by travelling through a time portal.  If you're a sci-Fi film fan then you will probably like this film a lot.  I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of time travel films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is just about the best movie I've seen this year. It has really great performances, beautiful animation, a really strong storyline, and even a great ending. It takes place during the year after a nuclear war, and it looks really beautiful. I had no idea that this was based on a book. I was shocked and entertained throughout.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have always been a sucker for a good old fashioned B-movie. In my childhood my dad would take me along on a weekly drive across the Great Plains to the Rocky Mountains, so the story of the movie is pretty classic. We start with a truck carrying several kids. We see the whole trailer from a good vantage point and then a couple of kids get stuck and the rest of the kids get their butts whipped. One of the boys is a bit slow, so one of the other kids throws him a switch. This is how it is done in Rocky :  A man named Eddie gives the kid his bike to ride, and the kid rides it over a hill and it hits him in the face and we cut to him in a hospital being patched up by some doctors. It is then up to the kids, played by the three principal actors who are all superb, all in their early to mid-30s, all playing characters that are either real or in some way relateable. This might not have been a great film, but it is a fine example of early B-film. A wonderful, entertaining, and extremely well-acted film. It won the Academy Award for best picture in 1936. I love it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was one of those movies that was just plain good.  The story has a nice feel to it, with a cast that seemed to be very likeable, and I was even able to see an action scene in which a good old-fashioned street car race was being set up (I don't know if anyone even remembers this movie).  A nice action scene, which is the way many action scenes in westerns should have been written in the 1950s:    It's really just about the story.   There's a nice bit about a man looking for his missing horse (though he seems to have left his horse on the other side of the country), which is one of my favorite things in any western movie.  It was a little hard to see at first, because of the bad sound and pictures.  But after a good run or two with the camera, the sound came back to life, and the pictures were better still.  There was plenty of good scenes in this film, and they all did a good job in portraying the era that was the golden age of westerns.  This is just a good film with good actors and a good story.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first half of The Shining is not a movie that's easy to watch (especially if you're not familiar with Stephen King's work). It begins with a group of friends - the Overlook Hotel's most eccentric residents - taking a short walk from their summer retreat in the White Mountains to see the sunset over the snowy landscape. It takes place over a weekend of vacations at the same place, but it isn't really a vacation from the horrors of the Overland Hotel. It's a vacation in the worst possible way. If you like Stephen King then this will be right up your alley. If not, it's too bad. I wasn't crazy about the story, but I loved the performances. The film stars the incomparable David Bowie. This is my favourite movie. It is the epitome of one of the most brilliant, bizarre stories about the human condition that I have ever come across. The cast is brilliant in all of their many different roles and the writing is superb. This isn't a movie to miss.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a great movie about the early days of the Beatles - before that, it was John and Yoko and Ringo! John Lennon is a sweet, silly and fun guy who is getting married to a lovely woman (Ringo) and they live in a small house. The Beatles are trying to create a "hit" song to go with their new album - but it's too bad the music people (Robby's gang) are so stupid. Then in the film John runs into the same friend from the early films who also is getting a girlfriend, and together they get the "hit."   A nice, silly movie about life in the early 60's.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me, The Girl Who Played With Fire is a classic in the making. If you enjoy classic film noir, The Lady Vanishes is a must-see. If The Girl From Shanghai (1970) were as good, maybe you would not be reading this review. The Girl from Shanghai is based on a true story and it's one of my favorite films. In The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Daniel Craig makes us believe that he is the world's greatest detective who gets the rare opportunity to travel around the world with a beautiful woman who may not be human. I love the movie and I think The Girl With the Dragon is a great adaptation of a great book. The plot revolves around three different women, a journalist, a writer, and a woman whose parents were murdered. The woman who writes the article, Nina (Maggie Gyllenhaal), wants to have a good friend and friend of her husband in India (Tilda Swinton). She sees the newspaper and falls in love with this young man (Amitabh Bachchan). The first time they meet, this young couple are sitting on a beach, looking at the sun. After a few minutes, the young man moves closer to his wife and tries to kiss her. The journalist, Nina, moves in front of him, and tells him that she has to ask permission of her boss (Sacha Baron Cohen), a friend of hers. The man thinks about it and says that she could ask her boss about it, but when she doesn't, he is surprised and tries again. Nina then moves closer and pushes her husband away and kisses him again. At first, he doesn't know what to do, but eventually decides to ask his friend to take him to India (Bachchan) and he gets permission. He tells his boss (Barsi) about what is happening, and her boss doesn't mind. She even gives him a new suit to wear. The next day, they are both shocked to see the photographer (Denzel Washington) outside their hotel. He has a beautiful smile on his face and is so young that nobody notices. They then find out that this is not the first time he has been photographed. The photographer also doesn't bother to hide his feelings for Nina. He walks into the hotel and makes a couple of phone calls and Nina tells him about her problems. After having an amazing dinner, they go to the beach, and they see a beautiful young woman,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I saw the title of this movie I thought it would be about the first moon landing. Not a moon landing! A moon landing and its two survivors, a kid and his mother. I knew it could not be about any of those things and for me that was one reason why I loved it. It was funny. It had a lot of heart. I found it interesting that the boy was almost never the one who came through on the big moment and I don't think it was a good idea. I also think the mother and the boy could have done a better job of keeping the mother from dying. It doesn't happen like this in real life and I think that this is why it was such a good story. It gave me a warm fuzzy feeling as a kid that I haven't had since I was a little boy who played with his toys and played baseball and then went outside to eat some candy and then played baseball again and this happened over and over. It took me back to times when I was an adventurous little boy and a little girl who would hide and wait for me to come home so we could play hide and seek and I would go out in a car I had borrowed. She would hide in a little closet so I would not see her. Sometimes she would pretend to look out the window so I wouldn't see her, and I knew she knew the answer the moment I would point it out to her. It is a long way back to when you were a little child and you would tell your mother, "When I grow up you will be a grandma." There are many places in the world where it doesn't rain all the time and I like to believe that in some of those places we would all live without rain all of the time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie! The director of this film is a very underrated director, but I think this is definitely a movie that deserves more attention! This film is just pure popcorn fun. I don't know what the director was thinking when he went ahead and made a film about an evil doll, but it was very clever and interesting! The film was fun! I loved the movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My first experience with a great movie was "My Darling Clementine" (1951). I don't think I've seen any good horror movie since then. This one was great - a nice little movie.  I was looking for a movie where a group of kids make a pact to never reveal the truth to another child until they grow up. There was a little bit of a plot at first - they all have to go to a party and there was a guy and a girl who were the party guests. The movie took on a little more life as the kids grew up. The adults were the bad guys and the girls were the good guys. The bad guy - "Dr. C" was a great villain. The girls were really beautiful and fun to be with. And one of my favorites - Clementine! Clementine was a lovely character. I don`t know who would have thought that children would find such joy in making a pact not to tell another child they were gay. They were very smart kids and didn`t need to feel shame or need to be told what to do. But no one ever thought of going so far as to tell a little girl she was pretty. This was one of those great little films that is a part of every movie lover`s childhood. I look forward to watching it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The  A.I.A. (2001) is one of those movies with two levels. On the first one, you get the  alien action movie, a movie made only for the American audience and the one that did not let the Americans down. It is a good action movie but it is not something special, not that we needed a movie like that. Then comes the second level, the one which is better than the first level. A.O.A. is not the first science fiction movie with artificial intelligence in it. It's the second one. But not only is it a good science fiction film it's a masterpiece. It shows that, like in real life, in the not too distant future the humans are starting to lose the struggle with the machines. Artificial Intelligence is not an idea or a theory, it is an actual technology. It uses artificial intelligence. It creates artificial intelligence using machine intelligence. Artificial intelligence is, in short, a supercomputer. And it works very well. It was created to solve, to find, to predict and to make some of the problems that the human race is facing. But it also has other special functions. Its main mission is to protect mankind from the alien attack, and it does that successfully. You get to meet the robot and you get to see how he works and how he reacts to what is happening around him. There is also a very interesting plot about the first steps in the development of the A. I. A., the human intelligence. But as for the characters, they are mostly not important. They are mostly just here to be different, to display that some characters in this movie are just plain dumb. One of the main characters of the movie is the scientist who works on the A-I. A and he gets to meet a robot. I am not going to describe their relationship. It would have to have a different level, but it's just not worth mentioning. Some of the other characters who show up are also just plain stupid. I don't even need to mention the scientists who have some kind of relationship with the A.-I. in the beginning of the story. The movie is a little short, but a good one. It doesn't waste any time to get going. In the end of the film you feel that it doesn't matter what level the movie plays at. It can play at all levels. I recommend it to people who like action movies, but also people who want to learn
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not at all sad that A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night was cancelled by ABC (I found it to be quite a good show!)   And then it was all downhill from there.   It's pretty depressing when the only thing you can find to show an episode from an old timey show is pictures of a girl in a bathing suit.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all let's put it out there:  This is not a bad movie. It's actually kind of an underrated gem.  I can't believe that this wasn't nominated for an Oscar.  It's hard to believe it. It is one of the most impressive performances in film history.   If you haven't seen it in a long time, I highly suggest you do so. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best way I can describe a movie is like watching a documentary with actual people. This documentary tells the story of a man named Mike McDaniel who is an amazing guy. Mike had a difficult childhood. It took Mike years to work up the courage to ask a girl out. However, he found that he could ask her out, which is the start of a great relationship. After a few months together, Mike started to find out that he was really an interesting guy. Soon, Mike became famous in the neighborhood. The neighborhood was a bit rough. Mike began to help these poor people because he felt it was his duty. One of these people was a young girl named Julie. Mike was always trying to make her laugh. Unfortunately, Julie had a hard time making it to Mike's home. Mike tried to help by going out to the alley behind the house. Julie couldn't make it to the house and eventually went home. The next day, Mike went to Julie's home and was trying to help with the dishes. Julie's father said, "Mike, you never go out to those places and you never come back. Why don't you go and watch television?" Mike tried not to get angry and told his father, "Don't get mad. I want to see Julie. She's a funny girl." Julie started laughing and said, 'You'd better go and tell her you won't be back until next week. Maybe then she'll laugh at you!" One of Mike's neighbors, a young man named Bill Wagon, told Mike, "I'm going to kick your ass." Mike told him, "You think you're going to be able to do that, huh? You think you can kick my ass out of my house?" Bill said, "'Cause if I do I'd have to break my knee." Mike tried his best to not get mad and said "That's ok, you'll break my leg." Bill started to get mad at Mike. He said, "...you want to watch TV? Oh good. Here's a TV. I'll tell you what I'm going do. I'm just going to sit down on a chair here and make a telephone call." Bill walked up to Mike and put his legs on the edge of the chair. He started to make the call and kept his legs out of the way. A few moments later, Bill started shouting, "Call 911!" Bill's legs had broken. He was badly injured and could not walk
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Spirited Away" is one of my favorite movies of all time, with Miyazaki's animation being one of the best ever made.  For this, the Japanese superstar, Takao Miyazaki, made a very difficult movie in a very challenging style.    The first half of the movie was very beautiful in it's simplicity, but then, the second half starts to become pretty difficult.  "Spirits are living beings. When they die, they are reborn in another world, in a place where spirits can have a much better life than in this world. There's a very strong spirit there called Goro. He is the main character of this movie.  Goro's spirit is much stronger than a man can be, and he can't help but to fight the spirit of a little girl, the granddaughter of the lord who brought him here, who is a demon.  At first, they don't fight much. Goro can't control himself so he gets angry and attacks her in a childish way. His spirit tries to help the little girl so much, that he makes his spirit a very beautiful spirit. He can take off his clothes as a young boy, which is a very nice touch.  But the movie has to end somewhere, so they enter a temple to go back to their world to stop the demon from spreading.  So, in the second part of the film, Goro becomes very strong and starts to protect his sister.  He is a real hero.  What I really like about this film, and really what makes it a masterpiece, is how Miyazaki has to use his character to make the movie. Giro has to be very powerful to protect her.  Miyazaki can really make a very good character.  And I loved how, in order to stop Goro from fighting the demon, we have to show Goro the consequences of his actions.  That is so very Miyazaki.  This is another masterpiece for Miyazaki and one of his best ever.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not gonna go on a lengthy story about the greatness of this movie. That's just not the kind of review I'm used to giving, but you're gonna have to sit through the whole movie, but the end is just as good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is the story of a guy who has just learned that he is to be the one to take on a mission to rescue a young girl, who has been kidnapped and held captive by the evil General Bannister (John Wayne), and is not much older than his father. His best friend, Pete (Sterling Hayden), is a veteran Marine who is not nearly as good as he should be, so the mission is to save the girl and get him back to his unit. And the best thing about it? It is as ridiculous as it is fun.  I don't think you could call it cheesy, but you could argue that it is over the top.  There are some really ridiculous scenes throughout the movie, such as Bannisters being chased by an angry dog and Bannisson riding a horse backwards down a mountain path, that are sure to make you laugh and probably to cry at the same time.  This film has so many things going for it.  It is the sort of movie that you will see a few times over your lifetime, and will always remember the most.  The dialogue is funny, the fights are ridiculous, and the general style of the film is fun, although there are more action films that are far better.  In conclusion:  This is a really enjoyable film that I have had a few laughs watching.  One of the things that I like most about this movie is the way that it features a young Sterling Hayden and his hilarious attempts to get away from Bannison.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a world of many films that are mostly bad (see the list of them at the bottom of the page), there is one that stands out above the rest. It's the story of a German-American soldier who, during World War II, found that he's unable to return to the U.S. after being injured during the battle against the Axis forces. He's forced to live a miserable life in a Russian prison camp and learns some good lessons about the meaning of life. In the final film in the trilogy about the American soldier who ended up in Russia to find a new life, the film is very well done. The movie has a very realistic feel to it and it also has a great deal of emotion. This film is also a very accurate portrayal of the Russian army's behavior. The story of this war is told with tremendous realism by Sergei Loznitsa, who directs with some skill and a deep understanding of the subject matter. The acting is also good, especially by the American actor, Robert Scott, who plays the American prisoner. The only reason why this movie gets only a 7 is that I found it too difficult to watch. The action scenes are intense and the action scenes don't need to be very long (the final battle is three or four minutes long) to be intense. The war scenes are fairly realistic as well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Matrix is one of the greatest movie ever made, the story is very original and the plot is highly imaginative.  Also the computer is a great invention and it is a rare example of a realistic technology. It is interesting to think about how many inventions are needed before the human body would adapt to it, I guess it would take a really advanced race of beings to make us as human as possible.  A wonderful movie that could be seen in any era.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very interesting, and well-scripted, thriller. It is based on a true story: a man who was working as a carpenter was working on a boat. An old woman who was suffering from depression, had a broken leg. The old lady walked to a small island, where she lived for a month. She was happy in the island, and enjoyed her little life. It was in the middle of this month, when one night, a man called and asked her to accompany him to a place, where he wanted to have sex with her. She did not really understand the guy's intentions, but she consented to go with him anyway. She got into the boat, and the man who approached her started to undress and play with her, while she was being molested by him. She didn't know what to think at the moment. Then, she managed to get out of the boat and went back to the island. But the story didn't end here. A few days later, the man brought her food, and she started to get back to her normal life. On the second day of her return, the person she was looking for showed up, and started to molest her again. This time, she was ready for the fight, so she went back and got her cane, and began to beat the guy with the cane. The guy, after getting hurt, tried to run away, but the cane got stuck in his ankle. That's where the guy took to the big blue boat. The man was able to get on the boat with the help of another girl, who had been waiting in the boat on the other side of the island for the guy. So, he took the other girl with him, and went to the mainland. The lady was in good spirits during the whole boat ride, but when they got to the shore, she said that she had to go home. The only thing left to do, was to take a taxi to her house. This is where things get strange. A taxi driver was waiting for the lady, and he asked her if she had any more water in the cabin. The cab driver then asked her why she had not told him the man's name. She replied, that she doesn't really know who he is, but at least he is not a murderer. The taxi driver then told the lady that he would take a ride with her and a friend. So the lady sat in the front seat of the taxi
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film. It is not in the best style of acting, but it is not bad either. It follows a simple plot: a poor man is given the chance to meet the man who has become his idol. I find the story quite sad but funny. I found it quite strange how the hero had been chosen in such a strange fashion. It makes no sense, but I will not complain about that. The acting is also funny. The film is more of a comedy then a drama. I did not like the story that much but the comedy was good. The movie also does not deal much with religious issues. I thought it should have been more of an adventure film. Overall I did enjoy this movie, and it was quite funny.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you love sci-fi/fantasy, this is a fantastic movie.   The first time I saw this was from my father, who had told me that this was the first movie I had seen that really gave me goosebumps.  It has been one of my favorite movies ever since.  The plot is fairly simple. A team of space scientists has been working on a way to travel back in time to prehistoric man, who lived more than 10,000 years ago.  They have found a way, but they must travel to a point in the past where they must destroy themselves, or else, time will run forward and they will not return.  This is a very simple plot, but so well made that you want to see how they pull it off.  When I was an eleven or twelve year old boy and I first heard of this movie I was very much like the kid in the picture:  I did not get it! I had to watch it again because my sister insisted I was so enthralled.  And I am not alone in that.  I like this movie so much, that I watched it in a double feature with my friends, and I even watched it with a group of elementary school students to show them how cool it is.  So in a little movie full of cool futuristic technology, I have to give credit to Steven Spielberg and his crew.  Steven Spielberg's movies are always cool.  He is the master of science fiction, and he is a true genius.  In this movie he is out to make a science fiction movie that is not just sci- fi, but a science fantasy movie. He did this with his movie Raiders of the Lost Ark.  But in this movie, instead of being based on the story of Indiana Jones, it is based on an old western story called Treasure of Sierra Madre. This movie is so cool, that the fact that it is set in outer space was irrelevant.  For me it was like an alternate version of Indiana Indiana where Indiana Jones is not Indiana Jones.  Even though I really loved the Indiana Jones movies, I always found myself wanting this movie to be a little more like Indiana Jones 3 (which is where the idea of a time traveling Indiana Jones comes from) but I did like how Spielberg incorporated the science fiction aspects into the story.  At the end of the movie, the scientists are almost totally destroyed. They need a way forward and then, they
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would like to add this to my personal "Top 10" list of good movies. It is not perfect, no movie is. However, it has a great message, and the story is good. It's hard to watch this movie, the soundtrack is very annoying and I found that out very quickly. It seemed that the whole film could have been better. That being said, I do enjoy this film and still have a soft spot in my heart for the actors, the plot, the directing and the cinematography. It reminds me of films like "The Godfather: Part 2" (a very good movie) or "The Dark Crystal" (my favorite movie ever) in how powerful it is. A lot of things just happen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think that there is a lot of potential for this movie to be really bad, and some people probably will be more annoyed by it than I am, but to me it's a very, very solid movie.   This movie starts off promisingly enough with a great opening title sequence, and then quickly goes wrong.  It takes the lead-character who is very, uh, obviously gay, and sets him up with a guy who is definitely not gay. I don't know what's so special about this movie other than being about two guys who want to kiss, and it does not seem to matter whether the two guys actually want to or not.  The lead character then spends a lot more time talking about why he feels this way. "I feel like an old fool at forty years old." "I don't feel like a woman at forty-two."  It's all so silly and contrived I can't believe it took people forty-five years to make a movie like this.  I don' t think the movie is that bad.  But I'm probably going to spend a lot less time watching this movie than I should. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was quite disappointed with the ending. It wasn't very satisfying and I think the actors should have been paid more money if they had done a better job at what they were given. The only good thing about the movie was the "I" song, which I thought was the best song ever written for a movie, but if you don't like it you're going to hate it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a wonderful movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've never thought I would live to see this movie, and yet here I am.    This is about a young man who is married to a girl of 15, and who is having a bad day.  There is a family in a small town who is not happy, and their old man dies.  They find out that the old man is buried by the side of a road, and he is the father of a baby boy.  The husband is so desperate to get the child, and the baby girl, that he goes into town and steals his own child so that he can raise the baby with him, and then the old guy dies and the child gets kidnapped.  This poor, sick old man never got to raise his own kids,  so I can't really blame him for being so desperate, especially since it was the only chance he had to see the child again.  Unfortunately, he is caught, and is sentenced to death.  So he goes up to the condemned, and asks the woman to bring back her child.  She says yes, but then they are caught and the man is sent to jail.  Meanwhile, the girl is in prison on a charge that she is the murderer of the husband.  However, the man who stole the child from the old person's grave is freed, and it turns out that this woman was only trying to be a good wife and take care of her baby.  Well, this is a strange little story that is really hard to figure out, even for me.  But I did learn something about how it is better to forgive than not forgive.  And I learned something about loving the child and making mistakes when you know you are in love with someone who deserves to be loved.  Overall, I really enjoyed the story of this movie.  It's a wonderful example of a life lesson about loving someone who doesn't deserve to be hated, and trying to make up with them when you can't be with them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched The Man with a Movie Camera once when I was in my early teens, but I never found myself getting all caught up watching the same scenes again and again. It was a pretty good short film about an old school bully, and it did get under my skin a little. It has a great cast of characters, and even a little music, but it never made me want to see it all over again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What's not to like?  It's a comedy that's almost too funny and almost too serious. It starts out like any other comic/horror flick with a guy who looks like a bad, bad, man who goes around stealing things from people who should have protected him.  He ends up saving a kid (played by a very young Kevin Kline) from a dog and then meets another guy played by John Candy (he's the man who gave the world Spanky in the "Scooby Doo" cartoons) who says he's the bad guy and they go to a castle.  The castle is empty so they wander around the woods and find this creepy old mansion.  Then they come across a little girl (played in the film by a young Michelle Pfeiffer) who looks just like Lola the ghost from "Ghost" or the woman from "House of the Devil" (in both of which she was played by the same actress).  Once they've seen what this place is, the guy decides it's a great idea to kidnap the girl to use as a slave.  There are a lot of cool gags in this movie (some of which may be considered a little too funny at times) but they all seem to come together in the finale, so that all together they become a pretty effective horror/comedy.  I guess you could also call this film a "horror-comedy" as well as a "comedy," but that's only if you like those genre terms being thrown around loosely.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie! I would have loved to have seen this film made by an American. It really doesn't seem like the movie was made for an American audience and I loved every minute of it! The music was fabulous, the acting was good, and the suspense was intense! I can only recommend this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a small thing to write a review about an action movie but when it is a very good action movie: a movie so effective and good that it is worth more than the price of admission - I was hooked.  This is a real star of this genre and it is also worth a watch for those who like action movies: I loved it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first half of this is absolutely incredible!  I didn't have a chance to see the film before watching the first half since I was on vacation.  It's a nice little story about a young boy and his grandfather who are out doing an afternoon on a train to the south of France.    The movie is really quite funny.  The boy goes to a shop to buy something to play with and the shop assistant gives him a little gift, a little plastic box.  Once the boy discovers what the toy is he realizes it's a piece of magic: "It's just like in fairy tales!   "The toy is alive!  It can talk!"   With his grandfather's help the boy sets out to find the toy and get a chance at adventure.  But he is pursued by the evil monster who turns out to be very real and very strong.  His strength is not even measured in his size at the end of the film.  There are even some great little details, like the little box of his being able to be carried across the railroad tracks.  One of the better parts of the movie is when the little boy is chasing the monster in a train with his grandfather following closely behind.  He eventually catches up with the monster.  It is really a wonderful movie that I wish I had a chance of going out there and seeing it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the early 1940's, in a tiny little village called El Alamein, three British colonial officers from England are stationed in a village called Ben Ali. They are all married, their wives live with them. The first officer is an ex-soldier of the First World War. The second is a war criminal who's been living in the village for years. The third officer has a family, but they are very poor. The townspeople are always asking them for more food and other things. Their lives are a mess. In order to put food on the table, the soldiers keep selling their guns to pay the village's bills. The officers are all in love with one another and they are all very much in love. But this is a very unromantic war. Sometimes things go badly, but it's very hard to make any mistakes. The soldiers are in love, they're in love so much they start to fall in love even more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    While I would have liked to see an older man being forced to marry a pretty young lady, this film is definitely worth seeing.   It's definitely not all about the violence and gore, the film itself isn't all that bad and it does have some decent acting by many of the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For those who are worried about its lack of violence and sexual content, fear not.  The entire movie is told from the perspective of the female lead, and while she never goes full-on crazy, she does indulge in some of the best kinky sex I have ever seen, and it was all delivered with such an endearing sweetness and innocence that I never wanted it to end.  As a fan of both Japanese and French cinema, I was glad to see that both genres are represented to this degree in Japanese cinema.  I was amazed at the amount of nudity in this movie, and that it was rendered so realistically was especially wonderful.  At the end of the movie I was so turned on that I was thinking about the girl right there all over again, and I wondered what was waiting for us when we get back to Earth.  My only complaint about this movie is its ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am sorry but this movie is not that much different from what we got here a few years ago. It's not that bad since it is very interesting to watch a few days after the war and the chaos, but the script is still stupid and it seems like the producers wanted the movie to be a kind of movie about how Germans were defeated by a "human wave" or something like that, but since there were no real German soldiers on it, the movie was pretty lame.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like horror, like the idea of an old man haunted by ghosts and creatures, then this is one great movie. If you are a movie lover, then you probably also like movies like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A lot of movies try to take advantage of the fact that the 80s were such a bad time.  We never learned to do anything, we were always running around and making out in our underwear and eating Doritos, and there were just so many ickier things going on back then.    So if anyone's going to try to emulate what it was like in the 80's and how horrible it was, here's a movie about a guy trying to pretend he didn't want to be a father. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The premise of this is a good one, you see the guy who kills people has an idea that people can be more dangerous when they get angry, which he tries to get them to go through by making them go out and kill people as much as he can, and then he gets shot in the head and is paralyzed from the waist down and left to rot, only to come back to life and try to kill more people (that is a pun, I don't know if that is intentional or not).   It is a pretty good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie with interesting plot, good acting, and a great set of characters. I really recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For the first time ever we've seen a "real" action movie set in the real world and done so in a way that makes a big difference to the way in which we think about the world.    This is the kind of movie that makes it difficult for any action movie to come along and be considered good.  A man is shot in the street, and the action is very quick to set up the violence that will follow.  As for the violence the effects are very convincing, and make it difficult to decide whether the action of the movie is really violent.  I don't think it is, but you could see what you thought you saw in there.  The way it is shot, in close-ups and close-up shots at odd angles, makes it very hard to decide what is happening, especially with the occasional close-in shot, and with the fact that we never really see anything from close up.  This makes it hard to tell who is responsible for what, and where we are in this movie.  But then a shot goes up (very well done) and the audience sees what the movie wants them to see, and it makes what we thought we were seeing look all the more realistic.  From there on in it gets very interesting.  Again, it's all in the editing.  It's all about timing, and you can't do that if you just use the quick cuts that are found in most action movies.  They only take up the time you need, and sometimes you have to get into the actual act, and then we are at the very edge of what any movie can achieve, and yet what we are actually seeing is real.  You can see people moving about in the world, and we are shown that without giving a single line of dialogue.  Because of that we have to think more about what it is that we are seeing than we otherwise might.  And I think it's that, and not any special effects that makes the movie work. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The whole film is a little reminiscent of "Star Wars", in that some of the characters act somewhat odd (i.e. a group of kids acting like a bunch of wisecracks), but it's definitely not "Star Trek".  It's just a cool little movie about aliens in a spaceship, it's not really a "Star Destroyer" in space, but it does have the "Star" in the title and it's certainly a "Starship", I just think the ending of the film is much better than the rest of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half is about an FBI agent named Peter Falk who is assigned to investigate a murder. He finds out that an old woman named Ruthie died in a bathtub from suffocation. She was buried under a stone at a place called "The Grove". She lived there from about 1880 to about 1905. Ruthie was only 14 years old when she died. The investigation of her death was difficult for Falk because the people who buried her had told him to "burn the place down, and bury the ashes in the field". Apparently they didn't want people to know where she was buried. She had been buried there because her name was Ruthie. When she was little, her parents were quite poor. It is not entirely known why she died because it was a very strange case. The people who made the grave hole say they did it because she didn't have enough to eat or wear. Falk also finds out the grave is surrounded by bushes and that there were no graves in the area. He does find out the old man who made her grave hole didn't actually make it. He was sent to the city to bury the deceased but was sent back and later killed by another man. The old man was put in charge of making a grave and when he was finished made a hole and placed Ruthie's remains under it. Apparently she had died of natural causes because of her age. After he finished making the grave he buried it again and then later killed this old man. What happened to the man after he died is unknown.  . This movie is not for the faint of heart. It takes a pretty graphic approach to death and is very scary. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a great example of a high-budget, low-budget horror movie. I know, I know - the budget is low, and the scares are low, but the movie is all right. A young couple moves to their new home, and it seems like a perfect place. But, it's a house with many secrets! (The title of the movie comes from an old folk tale: "A Little Girl and a Dark Hole")   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   (5)   This is an epic movie about a man named Bill who, in the last year of his life, decides to leave behind a comfortable life in Los Angeles and travel to Cuba. He makes the journey with three close friends: Joe (who is an idealist), Bill's mother, and the former President (whose political views aren't that far from Bill's). The trip is a challenge of epic proportions, with long walks on the beach, bad food, and of course, the weather.    Bill, Joe, and Bill's mom are the most remarkable people in the movie, as they are all human beings trapped in a machine which has no soul. The whole movie is the tale of Bill's journey to Cuba, from the days of a lonely boy, to the world of freedom.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story takes place in the fictional town of Kato-Kawa, located at the base of a mountain overlooking Tokyo Bay. It is home to a Japanese clan who, over time, have acquired vast riches. One of these, a middle-aged widow known as "The Mother" (Yoko Takeuchi), is trying to raise four of her children by herself as her only source of income after a difficult marriage and financial difficulties in her own past. She is a devout Buddhist and also believes in reincarnation. Her husband, a former police officer and her own brother-in-law, were both murdered by the Yakuza in the 1980s, and their children are not the only ones under the mother's responsibility. In a small country town known as Bishōnen, there is the only living person of Japanese descent - a mysterious woman known as The Mother. This movie's main character is not an ordinary person in the slightest. She may be an everyday Japanese woman of her age who has lost both her husband and her children, but she possesses the extraordinary power to control and manipulate the lives of people. She manipulates men, women and animals, and uses her unusual talent for doing so to obtain whatever she wants. In the course of her life, The Mother changes physically into a cat, into a bear, and to a bird and back again - each transformation being a natural phenomenon of her abilities. With the help of her four cats, she controls what happens to them and everything they say or do.   This is a fascinating movie, which is based on the famous novel by Yoshiko Mori, and which has the atmosphere of a true mystery thriller.  It is interesting to note that Yoshiko Kori's name was written all over the script!   It was filmed in 1988 and 1989, but the film was never released in America, due to the intense public interest in the story at the time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie made from the mind of one of the greatest directors of all time:  This is what a good film must have. It has a really good plot with plenty of twists in it. As a young girl, I was amazed at how beautiful she was as she ran around the park, in a short skirt that was not so much a short as it was tight, with a long hair that she waved in the air. I thought I'd be able to see her from up here on high. I never had an idea for a girl until I saw this movie. The movie was shot like it was an old movie, and it was well done. There was one scene where I really was interested to see how she was going to get the "boy" (as the movie called them) and I thought there might be a scene where she did something nice to him, but there wasn't. All that happened was that the "guy" left his wallet on the side of the pool and then the "girl" went up and started throwing a few rocks at it and I really thought maybe it was her way of saying "I got you. That's all there is for it, I'm finished with you now. I'm tired of you." There was a shot of him throwing rocks at the pool, I thought she was hitting it hard enough to knock it over, but then a kid in the audience comes up and sees her throwing rocks, then everyone else in the theater started applauding. The boy just stood there with a stunned expression on his face. The next scene shows the "dancing boy" running and she is chasing after him, trying to catch up. At the end of this movie is when I knew I would love this movie forever. When the "man" comes up to her, she throws her rock right at his head and he falls into the pool. She gets away with it and he cries, then starts to swim back out of the water. Then the man and the girl come out of nowhere together. I felt sick. How could someone do that to an old man, who is so helpless, who can't swim at all? Then I realized that all of this was all very well done, because I think that would be the only way it could have ever worked. The ending was very realistic and well done also. This movie makes me sad. I think we should all cry about this movie, that we watched.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film starts with a couple of people (Cary Grant and Joan Crawford) who run off to a remote spot, where they get into a shootout, with one of the characters dying in the crossfire.   As soon as the dust has settled, the survivors return to the town they had been forced to leave behind.  The townspeople and a couple (Sally Field and Charles Bronson) try to help the two survivors by setting up a tent for them on the outskirts of town, and then giving them food (but not much).   At the same time a local preacher is on the run after murdering a local businessman who refused to pay the preacher for preaching, and the townsfolk are hunting down the preacher, hoping to catch him.  For a while, things are looking up, until the preacher decides to kill the people he hates most (the townspeers) and get revenge on the townspeer who murdered his father, and also the town where his father died.  While waiting in line to see if the preacher is actually coming, a couple, John Wayne and Elizabeth Taylor, stop to chat with the mayor and his daughter.  They make a wisecrack about a young, pretty young woman who was killed by the preacher; but they don't seem to understand how serious the situation is... or how serious they seem to be about it...   And this movie isn't over yet.  It's the last of the "Jaws"-type movies that the producers had in the works at the same studio in the early '50s, to coincide with the release of 'Jaws II', which would be another huge hit.    As you might expect, the movie is a bit different, not least because the director, Robert Shaw, wanted to give it a different perspective - and to use a different shark.  This time we're not talking about a prehistoric creature, but a killer modern predator.  As you'd expect, it's played by the legendary, yet again, Paul Newman.  And it's really amazing what you'll see from this one!    I'm not sure how the producers made the decision to get a big star to play an old shark. Surely they wanted a young star with a big future in front of him? Or maybe they wanted someone with some charm?   Maybe they were too afraid to trust someone with a name like 'John Wayne', and wanted a non-famous actor
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like the classics and have never seen the original "Star Wars" movies, you can go out and see the "Return of the Jedi" the night it comes out (and it's going to be huge). I saw it the other night, and was not disappointed. It's a great action film with some great sets and great action sequences. The acting, the scenery and the music are as good as the original movie, so if you liked the original, you'll like the sequel.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those movies I can't stop watching, and this time the focus is on a small, obscure town.   It's also a comedy, but it's an odd one, because the main story is a bit of a mess: a small-town woman (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) has a strange accident; a new doctor (played wonderfully by George C. Scott), who's also been working at her house (his first time) finds a strange body, which seems to have been torn apart.  The body was wearing clothes that made it seem to be a woman, not a man...   After this "accident" the new doctor leaves, as his "boss" doesn't want him there; however, he's a bit more than a bit curious about the body and about the girl (Parker) who had it; the body's hands and legs are completely severed, and the hands and feet are wrapped in bandages.  So the doctor is a little obsessed with the body, and he keeps asking the other doctors and nurses about the mysterious woman.  Meanwhile, there's a "freak show" at the school, which has a young "girl" as the performer: she is completely "disfigured" by an accident: she can't have sex, and her legs are in such disrepair that she can only move about a few feet at a time.  Eventually, the doctor comes to take her home.  However, he finds that "Miss Mary" seems to be having some problems with her new legs, and is having problems keeping her legs together.  As the story goes on, the doctors and the staff are all curious, but they don't seem to know very much about the strange phenomena that is going on at the hospital.  This movie is very funny and strange, especially the part where the doctor discovers the strange body and the strange girl; it also uses lots of good effects and special effects.  I didn't care much for the story, although it seemed interesting; though it's a small town, it had the feel of a much more large town, which wasn't really a surprise. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a good story and a bad movie (and not as a bad bad movie).   I can tell that it's a movie made by an uneducated man (and by no means a very good one).  The story is bad because it's too complicated and complicated things have to happen at the same time.   The bad part is that I did not care to watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie so much I can't say anything bad about it. It's just a great movie with so much wit and good acting that I almost laughed out loud.  I hope the original filmmakers can make another one, because I would really like to see that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an important story that deserves the recognition it receives.   It is not perfect, as it is a historical drama.  We have two heroes, a priest and a soldier.  He was a good man, and a friend of Josephus.  The priest died fighting the Romans, and the soldier was wounded.  They return to the city to find their city destroyed and the Romans coming.  But a miracle happens, Josephus survives, and then he writes about all of this in The Antiquities of the Jews.  This story is about a woman who was a widow.  Her family was destroyed by the Romans.  It is clear that her husband was a faithful man, but she was very much a mother to the babies.  And then she had a daughter.  You do not see this family every day.  I do think the film was done well.  There were several different characters.  One of the most important characters is the wife.  She had a troubled past.  Now she is going to the Temple to find her children's father.  However, she must also find out what happened to her husband.  While the movie is not a historical study, this is a story about people doing the best they can.  Josephus was a very good historian.  If you are interested in the history of the Romans and the Jews, this movie is a must see.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of my favorite movies to date.  It's been a while since I had a good comedy.    This movie is just that good.  It has been said that a man cannot live on nothing.  So it seems that a guy named Jack has just enough money to support his family, and also to pay for the doctor visits his wife needs to keep her alive.  Now that's some great luck.  When Jack's wife, Sarah, is diagnosed with a brain tumour, Jack's father, Mr. Gurney (played by the late Steve McQueen), takes the money they have saved and has his brother (played here by John Malkovich), do something crazy and have Jack drive an old Buick LeSabre to Texas to find his wife.  Jack has been through so much since he met Sarah (when she came to live with him) and she's just about the only person who has given him a smile again.  His wife, however, is not quite so lucky.  She is not only suffering from a brain tumor, but she also has a very strange past.  This is a movie about what it feels like to be on the edge of the precipice of death, and it's a really good movie.  There's a lot of great acting here, and the movie is made for the screen rather than on it.  While some characters are introduced by way of their first name only, such as Joe Gurn.  He's the most pathetic character I've ever seen.  The only character of real worth that appears in this movie is a man named Ed, played by a pretty young woman named Laura Dern.  Although Laura doesn't appear to have a career future in mind when she becomes a waitress in a small town where the story is set, she does become a part of the story, and as a result of the events of the movie she becomes the object of love and/or jealousy of the two men who are trying to bring Jack back from the edge. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film has so many moments where it has a nice mix of action, comedy, mystery and drama and so many good performances. In the movie, there are many moments when the acting is on point. It is hard to believe that this movie is about a woman in a dress. She is the most perfect of all the characters in the movie. One of the best parts of the movie is how the movie has that feeling of the old-time silent movies that I have loved as a child. The movie is also about the struggle of a woman trying to find the meaning of her life. A lot of the actors really bring out their best. I think all of the performances in the film are very good. However, I would still like to see them all in a live performance for a live audience.   I think this movie would be good for anyone who would like a good suspense thriller and the thrill of the chase.  The first movie I ever saw that had a chase scene in it. I loved this movie. It has a great mix of suspense, comedy and drama.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    To start:  It should be obvious that this is a great film but this is the best movie to be produced by New Line Cinema that has ever been made and not only that it is also a great movie in the same vein as its predecessors like "A Few Good Men" "Three Kings" and "Goodfellas" and all other films that are of this ilk.   There is some strong acting by all of the actors in this movie but I think it was the fact that this movie is about the Mafia rather than a crime movie that makes these performances all the more brilliant.  I have to say though that despite the greatness of the acting that is in the movie and the great performances that are there the writing of the film is just plain lousy.  In fact the script is so bad that I have found little to no enjoyment from watching this movie,   and despite the fact I am a fan of The Godfather I find it rather difficult to get through this bad script,  It's really a shame that a film like this was produced when the studios are so much more talented than they ever were back in the day,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an interesting little film about a boy who is the first to be converted from a Catholic to an atheist, a story that is about more than just a boy's struggle with Christianity. There is a powerful moment of social commentary when an elderly woman is asked to explain why she had not taken her own life, and she says: "I don't want to go up there... I don't have anything to give."  And with that she gets up and walks away into the night, and it is a moment that can be used to describe the times, and the state of society, and certainly a time when a boy like the one depicted could have found nothing to give. - April 10, 2007Not your father's...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My parents bought this movie to me when I was in college because it is the quintessential "movie of the time."

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I heard that John Landis was writing a sequel to his original, I was a little nervous. I hadn't really liked his original (as I said above, it didn't do much for me), so I hadn'nt paid much attention to the plot of this one. Well, a couple months ago I bought a Blu-ray of the original and watched it a couple of times. Well it's good. That's why I went to see it again. When I told the guy I had just seen it he said "you haven't seen it yet?" and I said, "no, it's great!"

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'd read the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes (Rotten Tomos...no relation to the movie), and thought it would be like the movies I'd seen in high school: a bunch of bumbling morons (think "I Am Legend") trying to outdo one another in pointless gung-ho adventure movie clichés.   But it was different.  It was different because the characters actually had some complexity and seemed more human than the film-makers themselves.  They had genuine, interesting problems.  And because of this the movie actually grew on me, and I'd consider watching it again if I got the chance.  As I said in my first Rotten Tomato review, this is an adventure movie.  But this is so much more than an adventure.    It's a very moving movie, and not just because the lead characters have a lot of emotion.  There's heart, and a sense of wonder about the world we live in.  Also the film's not a rip off of anyone else.  In fact, I found myself looking forward to seeing it again the day it was released. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first part of the film is actually quite good in its own right; it focuses on a small town in the U.S. which has been devastated by a devastating oil spill. Most people in this small town have lost everything and are forced to live in the wilderness as far as possible from the toxic oil that has poisoned the ground. It is only after the oil is finally contained that some of those people get a chance to recover: a couple who are widowers whose love story has been a love story all their lives get a new start, but not before one man's dream is ruined by an ungrateful wife.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you enjoyed the movie, you will like the novel (which I've read in three days) and the other stuff they're doing in the meantime. That's all good. This time the world is divided into four big regions, East, Middle, West and South. In the region of East, we have the city of Alia, built on an island, surrounded by many hills (some of them very steep) and a sea of sand. To the East of Alina is the town of Shavari, which is only a few years old. The inhabitants of Shavi have lived without ever seeing a tree for hundreds of years. The sea surrounds this town and its only hope of escape is a river, which goes nowhere. But the river is being dammed every day to prevent it from drying up. This whole town is dying...or not. Shavi was once rich with all kinds of fish, which they still have even today. But those fish have long since been caught by the fish-catchers, who live near the city. The fish-catschers live in the houses of their wives, while the wives go out hunting. Some of the women have to work on the farm, while most of them just sit and wait for the sea to open the gates of the world again, so they can go back to Shavi and get the fish to eat again. That was another good thing about Alia: it didn't feel depressing. It was like an old dream come to life, in which everything was still perfect. But in Shavaristan, everything's got to change: the government, the government agents...even the gods. This is where the novel starts off; it takes place a couple of years after the ending of the movie...where we see a whole new world (if I'm not mistaken). The plot is actually quite simple: a group of young students from Shavi find out that the ocean that once covered the land has disappeared, and all the fish have gone home with the catchers. These young students are of course very upset about the fact that the world has changed so quickly; the people around them are still as happy as ever, and the sea and the land have both disappeared. They make a little pilgrimage to Shavara to try and get their memories back. But they get into so much trouble that when they finally get back home (the island is a little tiny bit bigger than the town, and is surrounded by
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can't believe it is almost twenty years ago since this movie came out. It is still a very entertaining film that I found very entertaining. But I also find it sad that in the early 90's, it was considered inappropriate for teenagers to watch. The main story has the main character, a teenage girl living alone on the farm, which happens to be in the woods in the middle of nowhere. She is a very good cook and there is a lot of food to be had but it doesn't look like she could eat all that food and still look pretty good. Her mother would find out if she did so and that would be the end of the world for her. Then one day she finds a little girl sitting on her shoulders and she is the daughter of her sister. She doesn't speak but she is very clever and is doing something very interesting that doesn't even really make sense. The kid has a magic bracelet with a spell written on it, that tells the girls when to have sex with each other. The little girl says they shouldn't and the spell doesn't tell her so. So the spell just gives the girls a set of clothes and makes them wear those clothes when they get together. The mother comes over and they have a fight and the girl who lives with the mother runs away with her little friend. The whole movie is the little girl trying to get away with the boy. The story is cute and the characters are very good. It has a lot to offer especially for anyone who loves movies about little girls running away from their mothers and the spells that tell them they have to get together at a certain time. I recommend watching this one on cable to those of you who haven't seen this before. If you are a fan of this kind of movie, then you will probably find this very enjoyable.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Giant" is the first film in the Giant-like trilogy. Like their predecessors, this film has no plot: The giant (played by Charles Burns) is sent on a wild ride down an enormous river, trying to avoid the giant (also played by Charles) who is also trying to get away from the river he is on. In between the two, various animals are trying to kill the giant, and it never takes any real effort to kill him, no matter how hard he tries to avoid it. And you really do want to kill those things. It's the kind of movie that has nothing new to say but is always entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm a big fan of John Carpenter and, more recently, John McTiernan. I saw some movies with these directors years ago - most notably "Escape From New York"  - and they still hold up. "Babylon 5" was really just an extended remake of "Apollo 13" with the aliens playing a part, though it seemed a bit more fun than its "Apollogon" inspiration. Even though the acting was mediocre, the special effects, music and visuals were very good. Unfortunately, the whole episode wasn't so good. The acting was uninspired, the plots were repetitive, the villains were over the top and a few of the characters were completely nonsensical (especially David). As usual, the writers couldn't think up any clever new twists or characters (the only thing that really got me involved was the mysterious new "Dr. Amanda Perry"). The story was pretty dull, but the special-effects and special effects didn't add anything to the overall enjoyment. The writing was somewhat better in "The Thing". There were more memorable lines than "Babies, babies, baby, babies" and the "Sputnik" episode actually was entertaining. It was fun to see the crew fight the robots and get themselves into trouble. It also had a cool ending - it got me to believe that the crew could be capable of beating a space Nazi (they weren't). I was also very fond of the music (not just the music in the credits - there were other, more interesting songs - "The Black Man" is a good example) and the music was well-timed with the story (and the visuals). It even had a couple of "B-Movie" moments - like when the bad guys shoot themselves up or when the evil alien is revealed to be a little boy. I also like that this movie, despite its flaws, is more than just a remake of one of those movies (a good example is that "Babel"  has been remade with a more interesting plot and a better script). I think it would make a good addition to any fans of "X-Men" and "Apocalypse Now". I will probably watch this one again when it comes out on DVD. If you like to see old movies with interesting plots and well-written characters, with a bit of gore and a good soundtrack, this is an excellent addition.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first act is fairly typical stuff, not really too bad, the pacing being better than usual too.  It's all pretty standard stuff, like the "evil" organization making a few mistakes and going back to normal, and the good guys trying to stop them. The story is basically a generic anti-heroine story but with more of a twist, it's interesting in this regard and gives it a bit of a new look and feel, and I think that it's a nice, fun movie.  The one thing that really impressed me was how they made it so the "good guys" can't do anything unless they are using the computer, which is weird.   It did keep the movie entertaining and exciting for the first half, but then, the movie slowed down a bit and I didn't care for most of the action, the characters were uninteresting and the overall plot got a bit confusing.  I have no idea what the plot was for the last 20 minutes, and it seemed like they skipped most of it and just kept going through the first 25 minutes.  There was a good amount of action, though, which I enjoy, but, it didn't have much of a plot to hold it together.  This movie has potential but it feels like it's getting a bit stale and boring. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a huge Star Wars fan, so seeing this movie made me sad at the demise of this iconic franchise that brought to us some of the most memorable characters of all time.   It's a pity that this movie is not widely available to people from around the world; it is the perfect introduction to an all-time classic, complete with amazing, classic characters, a fantastic story and a huge amount of humour that was so unexpected.  I hope that more movies like this will be made and if that is not possible, then this is one of those films that deserves to be shown in theaters again.   1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After several years of waiting, we finally get a good film on the silver screen. I liked this film so much I had to watch it several times in order to get the point. Not only is it a good looking movie, the actors are all good, and there is some nice action in it. But, the film is the most controversial on this list. The subject of this film is one of the most violent movies of all time. There is a lot of nudity and a lot that is hard to understand. This movie is an odd one. It is not a very good film by any definition. But it has enough to make it a worthy watch. It could also be interesting to see how this movie was produced. It was a long time before it was made, and some shots look more like a still from the movie than a movie. Also, there is one scene in the film that has nothing to do with the movie. The director had some trouble finding a director to star in this picture, and he used a lot actors, probably to get as much money as he could. One of these actors is pretty good in real life, so there's a chance to see him here on a smaller budget. One final note: a lot gets said about some of the women in this film. Some of them are good, some of them aren't very good. But I didn't think that these women were that bad. I do hope it does not hurt their careers or anything. I can't really say that I have ever seen a film more degrading to women than this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so disappointed when I saw this movie at a showing in Dallas. It's like the most boring movie ever. The characters just look like they could be at the local coffee shop. It was like they filmed this in Dallas, then hired extras to walk around and not do anything. The only good thing about it, the music was great and was not boring like the average movie you see. But I could not get into this movie. It had nothing to do with the rest of the films I have seen on TV. The producers tried to have something to do between movies, but it just didn't work. The other films I saw looked so much better. I think they need to start their own chain of local movie theatres.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you haven't seen this, this is a classic.   The story is about a boy and a girl (named Charlie) who play and are in a band.  It is all very simple, but very good and funny.  They take the time to make us laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the funniest, most original films I've seen.   As far as the comedy goes, it is pretty standard stuff, but the premise is genius.  It is like a big adventure where everyone tries to outsmart the bad guy, or find a way to outmaneuver him.  I can't say anything about the acting except that the director, Robert Zemeckis, is very good.  The music is pretty great too!  I hope they make a sequel!   *NOTE:   This isn't rated PG-13 so I will not say anything bad about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are a few reasons to watch this movie.  It is not a pretty movie. It is dark, very dark and there is a really unpleasant scene that is hard to watch.    I really thought that this movie would be better than a lot of other similar films that people have made over the years.  Some of those movies have been more entertaining.     A movie like this can make your hair stand up when you watch it.  When I first heard the score I was so surprised.  There is a certain score to a film like this and I have always wondered why the score was there in the first place.  As far as the acting goes I liked a good number of the actors.  I thought that there was a scene in the movie where a young boy is standing outside in the rain and is thinking about the people that he has killed.  The boy has a knife in his hand that he is trying to draw to see who is the next person to die. He is very young and is looking around for something to kill.  This is an incredibly disturbing movie to watch but I really enjoyed it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like your action and a good story - you will like this movie. The story, set in modern England, with its own unique twists and a twist ending, would make an enjoyable thriller. Although the film is a bit slow, the film has been well developed and a memorable adventure. It has a high entertainment value, thanks to the talented performances and superb special effects. The movie is a great example of a good, well-acted thriller. It would probably not be worth to watch more than once.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the kind of movie that makes you go "WOW" after a couple of minutes.   I haven't seen any films that have captured the imagination of me as much as this one.  The movie looks like it is shot in a low budget Hollywood film but the quality of the performances is not compromised.  I enjoyed this film and it will be a classic when it comes out on DVD. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is a great mixture of action and comedy. The characters are very well done and they have a little more to them than what is shown.  The movie is a little slow and a little on the long side, but it is a very entertaining movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed this movie so much it could have just kept running for another week (though I'm sure I wouldn't have minded that).  It is really just one long scene, but it's so well done that we are only treated to a short scene of John Travolta as the leader of some kind of cult (I think he's trying to seduce me) before we are thrust into the story.  The story was quite entertaining and it was good to see Travollet playing the lead character (though his dialogue often got stuck in my throat), and the casting of Peter Sellers (a fine actor) as the charismatic leader is really impressive.    The acting in the movie is very good, although some of it seems forced.  Some scenes are quite predictable, and some scenes seem to happen almost out of order (as do some of the dialogue), but the overall story is entertaining and the ending is a nice payoff for the movie.  It's not much to rave about, but I will say that if you like cult films this is one to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is good, the characters are great and the action sequences are great.   It's a good, low budget film, that's probably why I enjoyed it so much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story has some elements of a fairy tale (if you can call it that) and there are some truly funny scenes.   There is a scene in which a young, innocent (and therefore pretty useless) boy (played by the great William Haines) makes his way through the countryside by horseback.  It's very early in the year and, to the astonishment of all, the horses still work. There is also a song which is so stupid and obvious it's hard to believe anyone could enjoy it, especially the guy who writes it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the rare movie that, like the books it is based on, has a real message about the futility of war. It will also remind you that it's really a pretty lousy movie. It's a pretty bad movie, for many reasons: The story is pretty lame; the characters are not very interesting; the plot doesn't get any sort of momentum (especially at the end); and it does have some pretty weak special effects. However, you can't deny that it has a lot of heart, even if you are not going to be impressed by the plot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've watched this movie for years. My grandfather was a big fan of it and would often say that it's the best movie ever made.   That being said I don't believe it's so "great" as I had assumed it was. It's got some very good scenes, but overall not so good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a beautiful movie!   With a fantastic script by the brilliant Michael Lehmann, an awesome visual style by Tony Fabianco, and the acting of a bunch of fantastic kids (you know the type, all those little chaps in high school who never quite get over their shyness), it's really a wonder how this movie could ever be lost.   You think a kid's-eye view movie can only be a thing of beauty?   Sure, but in this case you got a picture that's so full of wonder that it can't be stopped. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was probably my most rewarding movie watching experience.  It was well shot, acted, and the story was both intriguing and fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most recent in the series was the best and if the original wasn't good enough the remake doesn't seem to be able to keep up. This time, the story is mostly about a woman who is given a new life after her husband dies while defending a village from invading Turks. The film is a good balance of adventure, romance, mystery and horror and has some really memorable moments.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is an interesting glimpse into the early days of the FBI. It's a really interesting mix of real world drama, real life psychology, and some of the best "possible" FBI training they could do. The movie also features an excellent performance from Gary Oldman. A lot of people complained about his performance in "The Fifth Estate," but I'm not one of them. His acting is so convincing, that even the actor in the next scene (who looks like Jack Nicholson) can't quite keep up with him.  I would also like to thank the film's Director, Michael Lantieri.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is so bad, but to get worse it's so good! It's as if a giant of modern day cinema just got out of jail for a time and had a good run in Europe, Italy, Spain, Morocco, France and South Africa! This film stars one of the most beautiful women in cinema, Marion Cotillard, as an exotic seductress who has a terrible obsession with a man who is a millionaire and her lover. They are having a nice time while a couple of gangsters hang around their place and they have a little fight about whether to drive the guy to a certain location. That's when the movie starts and it really doesn't look like much, except that Marion Cotillon is in great shape. Marion's face is beautiful, her body is huge and she's got a great backside. It's a pity the film isn't any good since it is worth a watch for the great acting, Marion's sex scenes and her beautiful French accent. I've only seen some of this movie but it looks much better than the picture and the actors. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those rare movies that will bring tears to your eyes. I have to say that I did not know who to root for in this movie. My husband and I went to see it because our local theatre was showing it in a midnight showing. It was a beautiful night at this theatre, even at this hour. The film begins with a woman walking down a dusty road in a long skirt, holding a handbag. As she walks, she says to herself, "I love this country." As the film progresses, it is revealed that this is a typical western movie set in Italy, but this one has a twist. The woman is married to a man who is the Pope. Her husband is a priest. Her son has been kidnapped. The movie is told entirely in Italian. There are a couple of scenes in English, but nothing else. The whole thing was told without sound. That was a real surprise. It also didn't contain any music. That too was a surprise because the film was shot with the camera going back and forth from the street to the church at different moments. There were no special effects. This is a beautiful movie, a classic Italian movie, which was shot in Italy. I wish I could have seen it last night. I will look for it on videotapes.  Recommended?   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not expecting a movie as good as this one. I knew the movie was about a man who tries to survive during the Cold War in a small town on the border of West Germany. And that is about it. The movie is all about the life of this man, his friends and his family. There is only one character in the whole movie who really interests me: a little boy.   But the movie's greatest strength is in the characters. There are not many that get the movie. Only the main characters. Even in a movie about the Cold war, they are all very memorable. And the story is really simple. The Cold war lasted many years. Germany was allied with the Soviets, but they lost the war and Germany started a war with the U.S. In that war, the U S. fought and won over Germany. The Nazis were defeated and the U State won the war.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie follows the story of a man called Mike who has a "little-man" problem. He has lost a large sum of money while trying to "fix" his "little man" in a rather silly manner. The poor little man, whom Mike has tried to "help" by sending him out to a "workbench" (a small room) to "train" the little man. What a great job Mike has done in the kitchen. He had to take the whole kitchen down to fix a leaky faucet. It seems the whole family of three have come to visit - Mike's mother is in her 80s, his sister is his niece, and his "old man" is his father. This movie is a real "must see" and I have to wonder what the other little man in the family is up to now.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For a long time, it was clear that a lot of people just could not seem to do a good American western. The genre has been done so many times that Hollywood had a field day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't usually comment on reviews, but if someone had not done a decent job of a remake of The Magnificent Ambersons I wouldn't have known this was a remake at all. The acting, however, is really off this time. The Magnificently Ambersonized AmbersONS (a pun, I know, but I still couldn't resist it). It's like a re-edit of The Honeymooners with a much smaller budget and a different director. The film is a little less serious about its subject matter (i.e. the life of the Ambersones) and a little more silly. It has an all-American feel to it. It would work very well in the Summer.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What can one say about this classic? There have been quite a few "Fantastic Four" movies since "The Fantastic Four" became popular in the 1960's, but this one is truly unique.  There is a sense of humor and a nice mix of good and bad characters.    You can enjoy the "Fright Night" sequences (especially the one where Ben Stiller's character was burned on the head) and the "Man on Fire" sequences.  It has its own charm and the action scenes are well done.  But the film really shines when it comes to the humor and the interactions between these two "Funny Men".  The "Fights" between them are amusing and funny as it should be.  And the film has a really good story.  There is a great feeling of nostalgia in this film and it is well worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great adventure tale! I saw this in a college theater and have enjoyed it ever since.   What a unique and interesting story!

I just think that I would like to see them battle each other more often in the future.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I never thought I would hear a voice come from a box, but when I did, I loved it. I liked it so much, in fact, that I made up a story about the girl who had come in that morning. I made this up right away, and then I wrote a poem about her. I've always loved poetry. I also like the stories in this book; one of them is about a child who sees a man in the bushes with his finger up his ass and thinks, how long is it before I catch a glimpse of his asshole? And that's it! It's just a child's story, and it doesn't take more than two minutes to understand that it isn't an allegory about anything. But I still like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of Michael Haneke.   He's one of the greats - and I really mean that.  He has a way with character, and I'm not just saying that because I think I could've done a lot better, I mean, he's been working at it so long - and he is always on point!   When I saw this movie for the first time, I had the same reaction that everyone else has had - "it's so good!"   If you like films like this - with very strong, often sadistic and often humorous themes, with great performances, and that you're also really funny - you're really going to love it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's great to see that Michael J Fox isn't done with movies. At least, that's the message I got from this movie. Michael J. Fox is a very good actor. He did a pretty good job in the movie and does a good job with the character too. The bad part about this movie though is the ending. I was really expecting that. It's too bad that they didn't really make a big deal out of it. It makes sense that if you have a bad reputation you wouldn't be able to work a lot of jobs and have kids, you might as well start a career as a movie star, so I guess it could be a story about how Michael JFox fell off the face of the Earth and came back. I would have liked to see more of his daughter's side of the family and his granddaughter's side. But at least there wasn't a "Michael Fox is evil" storyline. I think the movie had the potential to be a pretty funny movie. There's a little too much talking and that wasn't really my thing. I've always liked Michael J and I think he does a pretty nice job with this movie as well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is well made, good cinematography, and the special effects are all good. Not to mention it features the two best villains in modern Hollywood cinema in "Finger-lickin' Good" and "Little Lord Fauntleroy". Both were hilarious. There is also one more cameo appearance by "Dr. Fu Manchu" which is funny too.  This movie is also an excellent example of how a good comedy can be made with two big stars in a small movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember my first encounter with this film. I'd had a good long, long hard day of work (I was an executive in a hospital), and I was walking along the beach, and I saw a little girl playing in the surf and I thought I'd go and give her a few bucks, and she started to play. That's a nice little movie. I mean, it's really a sweet little film. And it's full of those little images of little children playing in a surf and little people playing in small rooms, you know, just being kind of kids and not knowing a lot, and this little girl doesn't know a lot. And she's in this house with her older brothers and sisters, and her mother and her grandmother, and there's a little window with the sea in it, and the little girl looks out at the sea and she's fascinated and she runs outside with the dogs, and when her dog gets tired and says, "It's no use! It's no good! It doesn't make any difference!" the little boy says, well, it makes a difference if you can see it, you can run faster, and he starts to run faster. And the little little girl keeps her eyes on the window, but she doesn't think any of that is going to be of any great use. It's a lovely film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was very skeptical about this movie since it had been years since I saw a remake/reboot or adaptation of a Japanese movie and it wasn't until I watched it again last night that I was convinced to give it a watch. It does live up to the name "Ghost in the Shell" and to the original manga. It is an action-packed thriller that is all about the action and the big guns and the bad guys.   If you liked Ghost in the shell, then you will love this one. If you have never seen the original, then give it another shot! If you've never seen Ghost in The Shell, then don't be afraid to give this one a shot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are times in life when you've got to be careful with your words, and in this case, that's the case.    A couple of years ago, I started getting some offers to work in the area of animation and video production.   After looking into it, I came to the conclusion that I was not qualified for that.  It all kind of made sense at the time.  But I think that now it's time to get back on track.  In this video, there's not a lot going on; there are some brief moments of action in it.  We see a couple of scenes of a young couple in the bedroom.  Then there's an extended sequence of a guy in a hot tub and the wife of the guy watching TV.  The wife is on the phone and we get a brief look at her phone and then we see a very dark picture of a black man's hand and then the picture gets really dark...   I am kind of impressed by the talent of the people who made this video.  They do a good job at creating an intense effect with some pretty dark backgrounds.  You'll notice that the background is just a black screen in the beginning, but then the light coming into the bedroom is enough to make the background look like it's glowing.  Now that's some talent!   We also see some scenes of people smoking, a woman with long hair and hair dyed black, a couple driving a car with the windows down, a black woman in a red dress, some people smoking and some other scenes.  There's even a scene where the man is sitting on a bench.  He looks rather familiar to me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In case anyone has never seen an episode of  BOB'S BURGERS  you're missing out. This is one of those shows where the jokes get old very fast but the animation is beautiful.  The voice acting is top notch and the humor is still funny today.  I give it a 10/10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is an old timey classic of a film that has to have been filmed way earlier than it was.   This film has a fantastic old school vibe with great performances.  The story is interesting and the script is well written.  A good old time movie that will make you laugh and smile.  This is one of the great classics of the classic horror genre. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have never been a huge fan of the classic Disney movie The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1925), which is one reason I didn't think the film would be great in 3D. However, this isn't a typical 3D film and that is why it is a hit: it is very funny, has a lot of heart, and has a great lead performance by Jean Harlow. The story is about a mysterious man called the Hunch Back who travels around the world and ends up in a magical castle where he learns that he is a Hunch. The Hinching is a big problem for the inhabitants of the castle, and a number of people try to figure out how to get rid of the Hinch. They all find that he can't be defeated until the Hincks are all dead or captured. The movie has a few great lines, but they don't go far enough to make up for the poor 2-D animation. It isn't bad, per se, but there are better movies available.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was in love with this film! I love movies about people who aren't like other people, and I am in love right now with "A Bad Moms Christmas".   This isn't a movie about Christmas, or any other holiday! This is a movie that gives you an idea of why Christmas has been such a huge part of American history, and a big deal.   All the family was excited to get together again, but instead of Christmas presents they got a new Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve is the end of the year when everyone goes to the house of the mother's family. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've had some amazing experiences with this movie (and yes, the opening is great and very well acted). It is not an action movie but definitely has a good story. It is a real eye-opener, at least I think it is. I didn't know there were these kinds of people out here. I thought we had just entered the dark age. I was right about one thing...
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say that even though I hate myself, I really enjoyed this movie. I think most movie lovers would agree that these two actors could have done worse things.   The first half of the movie is kind of boring. It is filled with the typical Hollywood stuff you see in most movies. The only really interesting scene is the one where we see the mother and son being questioned by the police about a murder that has occurred.  While this is good to see, it isn't really enough for a movie like this to be enjoyable.  The second half of this movie is much better. It actually feels like a movie from a movie and not the 90's. The murder is interesting, the acting is good, and the movie even uses some of my favorite movie scenes.  For instance, there is a great scene where a prostitute tells her boss where the police are. The boss tells the prostitute to wait because there is no time for a quickie before they go in. Well, that's the kind of movie this is.  And you know what else is great about it? It's funny.  It was funny the first time I saw it, and even funnier later.  I thought the movie was kind of like a cross between The Blues Brothers and A Night at the Opera. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  An old movie that is almost forgotten. It's very well-made, very romantic and, at the same time, it's very much a man's movie. It has its funny moments (I was a little surprised that there was no kiss between them) but it's mainly about a man who is trying to marry a beautiful and rich woman. That's it. So, yes, the film is very old, yes it's romantic, and yes it seems to me like a love story. So what? So what. It was a good film. The most romantic thing I ever saw.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's nothing really to say about this film, because it is simply a masterpiece. It is very different, but it is wonderful. It will make you feel all sorts of emotions: happiness, sadness, horror, love, hate, love again, etc.   This film is about a man whose family was killed in a plane crash. But, to be honest, he had nothing to live for. So he got a job as an aircraft mechanic at a small airline called "Lucky Air", but the boss is very kind to him, and it is only because of this he will make it through. The story follows the story of a man named Richard (I am not going to call him Richard. I will call him "Richard" from here on), and we see the events of his life in the beginning of it. He's a loner. He was kicked out of college for being gay, and after he became a pilot he got into a plane wreck and died a horrible death. But then, as his friends were about to die he meets "Lolita", and she has an extraordinary effect on him. So, he gets his life back together and decides to use his experiences to find Lolita, who is looking for help in a remote town where, unfortunately, most of the people in it are dying of the plague or whatever, and is seeking the help of Richard.  So, that's pretty much all there is to it. And the story is really a classic. It has a lot of humor in it. It does have a good soundtrack, and all the actors and crew really give it a nice vibe.  The film is based on an excellent book of the same name by Vladimir Nabokov (I read it when I was 15, it was one of those books you just had to get), about a guy named Richard and his life after he is told he is dying, and he can go back to his family, and his lover Lolita.  I loved it. I watched it several times in theaters.  A film like this is a dream come true, if you're a fan of bad stories, suspense, and humor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best scene of the movie was one in which the main character finds out that he is in love with a gorgeous woman.  In addition to his lover, he has the perfect little son who is a nice, cute little boy.    I've always been fond of this movie.  The characters all have a certain kind of energy.  While I like to think that the movie is based on a true story, the way it's presented and the way the characters act, it's more likely to be a movie about a woman who can't get along with her husband and how she tries to use religion as a crutch.  If that's not enough, she then gets rid of the wife by telling him she has a husband and a son.  This is a movie that has its share of drama, but it's not really dramatic.  It has plenty of good jokes, but they are all over the place.  I liked it but it does have some problems. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is an action movie with an interesting plot, though the story line has some problems.   The action is good with some high impact scenes.  There are a lot of explosions, a lot.  One of the cool gadgets is a jet plane.  The main character in this movie does not look like he is in the best of health.     The story line is a little weird, and the end is a mystery at which I am not sure how to answer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie. There are a lot of characters, but the movie really begins with a bang. This movie has a lot to offer. There is the great plot about a guy that wants to go to a baseball game, but his girlfriend doesn't want to leave. There's also a lot about the baseball season and how great it is. All of the characters are different and great at what they do. If you are like me and you like action movies, this movie is for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of those movies that you watch for an hour or so and then just sort of go back to watching the first film again.   As a matter of fact, there's a lot of scenes in this one that don't have any connection to the first one whatsoever.  To begin with, we have Jack (George C. Scott), who's in the army for two years and never has a drink. Then, one day he gets a case of whiskey and his drinking becomes excessive.  The next day he goes on the road with his buddies, and they find a small train which has run away. They decide to go after it and try to find the thief.  I don't remember exactly how he did it, but Jack manages to steal a horse.  Then he decides to drive off, but they discover the train has been followed by a sleigh.  And that's where things get really interesting.  We meet several of the characters and learn a little about their lives, but then the movie goes back to the beginning.  Jack has just been wounded at the battle of the Somme.  While in a hospital, he meets a girl and they have a happy time together.  Eventually she tells him about a secret organization and how they try to restore the British Empire.  She's a spy for the organization, and Jack's not sure this is the woman he wants.  They go to a restaurant, and then Jack and the woman have sex.  This leads to a second attempt on Jack's life, this time with an AK-47.  When Jack finds out, he gets an idea about how they might get to the organization's headquarters.  So he goes to a hotel and meets a man there who tells him more about the organization.  But at the same time Jack's girlfriend dies and Jack decides he wants to find out more about this organization before it decides to kill him.  (It should be noted that both of these attempts on Jacks life were staged to look like they were from his own mind.  There are only a couple of shots, and even when they show what looks to be a bullet hole in the wall, I am not sure who did it.  It looks to me as though it's some one that is walking along with a gun, or the bullet came through the ceiling.)  So, the two go and meet the organization and find out that this is a front organization for the U.S

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It does not even bother me that "The Magnificent Seven" has an all-out western, or that it is a pre-Code Western at that. It just means the film had the resources to make a good Western. As always, there is no script but a great team of actors that work well together.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has been out for awhile now and has received quite a bit of good reviews, and a few bad ones.  The movie is good.   But for those who want to see a more intense film that will make them laugh or get a kick out of something that they wouldn't want to look at in real life, I recommend giving this one a chance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies where all the characters are just so wonderfully played by an assortment of great actors. The movie follows a young man who has just moved back to his home town from college where he had majored in the study of ancient Egyptian history. While out walking one day he is approached by an old lady in a wheelchair who is interested in learning about the life of a hermit on the Island of the Dead. When the old lady offers to show him around she begins to tell him about the various mysteries surrounding the island but then she stops and turns to him and simply says: "You've seen everything there is, haven't you?" Now it's one thing to put a few clues together on a map but to actually go out and see the island in person and see what awaits in the depths is an experience that the young man will never forget.    The Island of Doctor Moreau (1941) in black and white This is an example of a movie where, as in this case, a character who should have been an important part of the story ends up being less than interesting.  I have previously written about how I don't think that Dr. Moreau is really a good example of the genre but he is a good enough example in this movie. The main reason I find this film interesting is that it shows how strange life can be in the middle of nowhere if you're an old man with a rather unusual looking beard.  The other reason for me to enjoy the film is the casting, not only by Edward G. Robinson but by the other actors too. I think there is a really nice contrast between the older actor and the young actor in this film and the older one's performance is definitely the star. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this coming and had high hopes for it, but did not think it would be as good as it was.   This movie will stay with me for a long time, even though it may not have been the most original film out there.  The movie centers around the family of a man who has been in a mental hospital since he was a child. After the death of the man's wife, his daughter and her child become the caretakers of the building. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a very good movie. For me it is a very nice story. It was quite hard to watch, but worth watching all the way through. It is quite different from what we usually see in cinema, this isn't the typical "bad guy" and "good guy". This is a man who wants to do a good job for his country but has a problem because he knows that he has a big problem. A very good and nice film. If you want to watch a good bad movie, check this one out!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was only a few hours away from a major birthday, and decided to treat myself. I found an online video that seemed good enough to watch, so it was a no brainer. It was very well produced. The actors all looked and sounded different, but were still enjoyable. I'm not sure how it fits into my life, but it would be fun watching this movie again. I don't think I'd like to see it as much again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't even know there was a film called "A Night at the Roxbury" until a friend who worked there brought it up while I was looking for a movie to watch. In the end I found it to be the best movie about a gay night out to be released in decades, from the wonderfully written screenplay by Jonathan Ames to the performances by all the greats in the film. I think it could be my favorite gay film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title of this movie is misleading in that we don't see what happens to the family - and there's much that happens: a tragic car accident, a young child with leukemia, the husband taking to the street to do things in search of his daughter, the family members coming to terms with the fact that the husband and child are not going to make it any more, and a good many other things. I don't know how they've got off the ground so quickly. I'm sorry that I didn't see the picture when I went in; it looks so much better in the movie. I saw it with my friend, who is a student of film. If I hadn't been looking at the picture and trying to concentrate on him, I wouldn't have been able to see the movie (which is probably why I only saw it twice, and didn't go out and see the film in New York). You can see why it has the "C" rating it has in America: you see a lot of driving, some violence, a lot sex, a little nudity, and some pretty decent dialogue (one of which I've never heard, and I love to hear it. It's a dialogue between a young boy and a woman in bed), but all in all, it's just a very, very mediocre movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's plotline (involving the relationship between a schoolteacher and a student) is not one you'd expect in a movie about a girl who becomes obsessed with a boy in her class who's apparently a bit odd. In fact, I think this movie is actually kind of funny. It's a comedy about two characters who are both obsessed with each other (the teacher and the boy, respectively) and who eventually find themselves in bed with each and every one of their classmates. The only real problem with this movie (apart from its somewhat "horrible" ending) is that it starts to feel more and more like a comedy than a story. I mean, it all starts out pretty funny (the schoolteachers talking to each other in their own words) but as it goes on I kind of lost interest. It really comes down to the point where the two characters find themselves having sex with every single girl in class and that's pretty much it. The first half of the movie is pretty good, with a really nice song (the main theme) and some nice visuals (the girls' costumes being very eye-catching, especially the ones the teacher's friends are in), but it all ends in kind of a bad way (the last shot of the "first half" of the film, that one with the girl's underwear being pulled off by a strap-on). The rest of it, though, isn't much better. It feels like it was meant to be just an interesting comedy with a good story attached to it, but I just couldn't get into it, I guess. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts like a bad horror movie: we see a man walking, the man has an invisible shadow, it follows him all around. The man is talking to himself while he walks but, as he leaves a house, the shadow goes behind him. When he comes out and turns around, it's gone, and we see him walking on the other side of a bridge, alone and looking for the shadow. Now, this is what I like about this movie: no blood, no zombies, just a good scare movie.  The film was based on a stage play. I never read any of the plays but I've heard that the play itself didn't get very good reviews. It's pretty good but, like most scary movies, it has a lot of good scares.  I guess I should thank John Frankenheimer for letting us see his movie. My only regret is that the sound wasn't better. I loved this movie. I liked the idea of the shadow and also liked the movie itself, which is a good old horror film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're a fan of film noir, then chances are you've seen The Killing and The Long Goodbye (although I'm not sure which is better): both great films with a unique approach to the noir genre.   While The Killing has an abundance of gothic violence and dark themes, The Long Delay has a good old fashioned story of murder and murder on a boat in the Caribbean.  There's also a nice cameo from Frank Sinatra in the ending credits.  As the title suggests, The Killing is a slow burn, but the plot has a perfect ending, making it one of my favorites.  In The Long Delay, we have a story set in modern day Miami, and you can tell that this is a film made in the 1970s.  It's a well acted movie by everyone in the cast, especially the great Paul Sorvino who plays a character who is still trying to come to grips with the fact that he is now a "murderess".   The screenplay by Robert Towne is a masterpiece, so well written that you can imagine it being written in the 1930s. It has a unique look and feel to it, with a strong sense of atmospheric dread.  The score by Jerry Goldsmith is pretty standard, but it does give a great sense of atmosphere to the film, especially when you see the long, thin fingers of the hands of the vampires.  Overall, this was an awesome movie, a fun little treat for everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I first saw this film around ten years ago, when the director was in my town, and I watched it several times in the ensuing years. I always enjoyed it, and always thought its themes were relevant in today's world. It was a bit of a long film, and one of the worst in the director's filmography, which is a shame.  The movie was set in the present day, which isn't great, but it still contains some pretty good scenes. It is a bit cheesy and too slow to be good, but I like that it features a number of good actors. I particularly liked the performances from Bill Skarsgard, who played one of those guys whose family has been killed by the mob, and also Paul Kolsky as the lawyer who works to make things right.   The ending is a nice touch, which brings everything full circle, and adds a nice little bit of humor to the film, which I found nice.  Another nice bit of acting from Gary Oldman in the movie.  I'm sure the film has aged somewhat since I last saw it, although the idea of mobsters trying to work with a judge who is both a mafia boss and a judge is still pretty much as good as it ever was. I can see why this movie is on this list. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good story with some great action scenes:    The first half of the movie is a fairly dull sequence of story elements that has nothing to do with the plotline of the film, and so is easily avoided:        The second half of " The Man with the Golden Gun " is the real thing, with brilliant and well-written dialogue and some great fight scenes.   The story is told in the style of a noir thriller, but it is a very effective one.

There she discovers that a mysterious man from a strange land named Sree Narayan is her real father.  He is the godman (shakta) of that village.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's hard to not be impressed by  This is The End    as it not only proves itself as a brilliant comedy, but one that is also thoroughly, brilliantly absurd.   This is the kind of thing that you simply don't see every day.  I will say again: this is a brilliant movie.  The whole movie is so incredibly absurd, it is hilarious in its ridiculousness.  It might seem hard to believe that a movie with over 70,000 people in it has such a strong sense of humor, but it is actually surprisingly rare.  This film does its research in an interesting way.  You are introduced to the main characters at an interesting time: the very first scene in which they meet each other is hilarious, and the last scene of the movie is also hilarious.  With so many things happening, one would expect the movie to end up with a big punchline.  But it doesn't.  Instead, the movie ends on a rather serious note.  There is a rather nice message in the movie, which I will get to in a moment.  Part of what makes this movie so entertaining is how bizarre it is.  A group of people are trapped in an elevator, and one of them has to hold onto a rope and swing up and down, as if he were being pulled to heaven or hell.  Not surprisingly, he does not get a high enough laugh, though.  And yet, it manages to be a funny movie. The movie has many memorable scenes.  One of the most memorable is the scene where the group is in a supermarket with the elevator door open, and they are all talking about how they can see "the devil" inside it.  They seem to be convinced that they are being watched, and you get a little idea of what sort of movie they are in.  Another memorable scene is a scene in the elevator where the main character holds onto the rope, and when he falls to the ground, his girlfriend grabs hold of him and he screams, in a hilariously bad movie accent.  Perhaps my favorite is when the characters are in bed. They are eating a dinner that has bacon and onions, and then suddenly one of the characters says, "Oops! I forgot onions!"  It is only a few moments later that we see how that is a very bad idea.  What truly makes this good movie really is the ending.  After all of the craziness,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had to see this.   It's not one of those movies that everyone needs to see.  It was made for a specific market, and that market is kids.  Yes, the action-packed stuff will be fun for kids. Yes, it has great music.  But the real story?   This is one of the most realistic, and compassionate movies I have ever seen on film.  The way that the characters in the movie live with the world that is thrown at them.  Their relationships are realistic, with real consequences.  They do not go around blowing up everything they see. There is no villain to destroy the world.  Instead, the world is destroyed around them, and the characters struggle to survive.  There is a theme of survival at play in this movie.  I really enjoyed this movie a lot.  A very well done, and realistic movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have had a great time watching this movie. It's not just the story, but it's all the characters.  The movie is told in the third person.  They all had their reasons for doing this.  Their reasons for taking the job were just as strong.  Everyone in this movie was trying to do the right thing.  I loved the movie for many reasons.   It is well made and very interesting.  It wasn't just a story of a young woman trying to get through life.  There are so many stories about women who have been through a great deal of pain and want something better for their lives.  This movie is a good reminder that some women can be very tough and very smart. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The title is a bit misleading as it seems to be a very silly movie.  As the movie begins, the lead actress comes to a party that she will be attending. The other guests are all in a frenzy over this young actress.  The movie then continues with a lot of hilarious stuff such as one actor playing two roles in a very strange manner and another actor acting like the villain in a horror movie. The story then continues as an old friend who lives in the same town as the lead actor shows up and introduces her to his son.  It is then that the lead-actor begins to change from the old actor that she thought she knew to a much more interesting version.    The acting is wonderful.  Even the movie gets a bit silly at times.  While I would never say that this is an "A" movie, I would say that it is a great movie that can be enjoyed by anyone who has had a good laugh at some of the characters, especially the ones that have more than one personality. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An original, intelligent, provocative film from the makers of "Innocence of Muslims," who take the Muslim world in a new direction by offering a new perspective on a sacred text, "The Book of Wisdom" (also known as The Torah or The Torah of Moses).  This is a compelling, thoughtful, witty, intelligent movie.   The film is divided into three sections: (1) The Beginnings.  The story begins with a Jewish family who decides to leave their home town of Yafo and travel to a neighboring Muslim town, Sidon.  This town is a fairly traditional one with many residents belonging to various branches of Judaism: Shneem (who is a Hasidic Jew), Eliyahu (another Hasid), Yehoshua (a Pharisaical Jew), and Eliyosha (who belongs to a group of Jews called the Shema'ah who consider their religion the only valid one.)   One of the characters in the film is named Eliyousha and we soon learn that she is a member of the Shemitah and has a deep hatred of Yafa.    It is here that we see Eliyoosha, who is quite talented with her "bikini."   It is at this point that we get the first great character development.    The Shemaah are led by a man named Shem Tov (played by a charming and talented young actor named Adam Beach.  Beach has become quite popular as of late with his role in the movie "Benny and Joon."  It should be noted that this film is made in Egypt not in Israel.  I was not sure at first whether or not this was the case, but this is an Egyptian film which is often overlooked in the United States.  It's not a bad movie by any means, but it is definitely a "foreigner" film which, sadly, has not received much acclaim overseas.  (2) The Exodus.  Here, we go to the very heart of the issue.  The two main characters are Moses and the Hebrew woman who was a slave girl in Egypt.  Moses is a religious man and a prophet and he travels to Sidon because of a vision he had in which he saw God sitting on the throne of Sidon and the Lord commanding Moses to go and take his people.  One may wonder how long a journey it would take for an ordinary man to
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, it sure is a movie:  (as I wrote in the review for this, the film will probably get at least some serious awards if not more than that).  But, it also has a good plot.  I'm not a very big Star Wars fan, but I do like this kind of movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best part of this film is the way it takes you back to the golden age of science fiction. It's not a sci-fi movie, and there isn't much here that's worth the price of admission. It doesn't even attempt to set up a new continuity for the franchise; instead, it brings together two of the most famous, yet least likely, names in sci-fiction history.  For a short period of time in the late 60s, Star Trek seemed like a sure thing: the Enterprise wasn't exactly a "space opera" in a conventional sense (though this wasn't really the case - the writers' tendency to treat it more like a comic book was a major factor), but the show's vision of a future which was based on science, science fiction, science was compelling.  I'll just skip over the "Space Oddity" episode  It wasn't all that good, but it was better than it had any right to be.   It's hard to get too excited about this, because it's an essentially "dumbed-down" version of the same concepts that had made the original series so popular.  But what else are they?    That's a good thing, right?  This is the first Star Trek I've seen since I was a kid, and in a world where the Borg seem to be the dominant menace, the Federation seems to be struggling, the Klingons are trying to break away from the Star Empire and the Romulans are trying hard to build a base on Mars, it seems almost like a breath of fresh air to have a show which isn't trying to be something it's not, but is still somehow at once interesting, fun and intriguing.  It doesn-t quite have a "hit" factor like Star Trek: The Next Generation, but I think it could become one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. Its a great little flick with a story that does not hold the interest of the viewer for long. The main character is a simple farmer who makes a nice living for his family. He also teaches his son how to farm and makes sure that the children grow up being happy. The plot follows him as he learns the truth behind the events surrounding the murder of his wife and two daughters. The movie is well acted, with good acting by the leads. There is also great scenery that makes the whole movie look as though it is filmed in the mountains, which is true. I can appreciate how easy it is to get involved with this movie, especially since it takes place in such a small town. This movie is certainly a good time, with a nice sense of humor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie! I think I would give this a 6 out of 10 if not for the terrible music (no offense to that band - they are good) - but I'm sure it was their fault, not the movie!   This is a well written movie and the only reason I gave this a 5 is because I'm giving it to someone else for her birthday and I couldn't think of anything that would make a better movie than this one!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It takes an unusual, even downright weird, turn during its second half. A very good, very entertaining adventure, with an old lady being chased, pursued, pursued. The plot line is very much like "the little train" and the final shootout will make you feel like you are in a time machine. I also like the fact that some of the actors look like old time comedians.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I found this to be a rather entertaining movie with a lot of heart. This was a movie that I had the opportunity to see on a Saturday night, and at around 7 PM it seemed too perfect not to go see. I do love comedies, and there is always something funny in every movie. The film is well acted and the dialog is funny as well. I had never seen a movie so good, and I hope the director continues. It's so good!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know what the word for this movie would be: a little too far out, a bit too weird, a little boring, just a tad too short to be anything else, but I think it's a fine little movie that has everything a good alien-movie should have. It's kind of like a science fiction version of a low budget movie from the late eighties: a good bit of science fiction, with alien interiors, and an original style of filming, with a good story (at least a very good story), and good acting. The film is based on the book by William Shatner and produced by Rick Baker, with the same creative team as the "Star Trek" movies, a talented, experienced screenwriter (Baker), a great director (Meyer), and a pretty good actor. Shatson had never acted like this before, but the part of R.O.B. is just wonderful. It was good to hear him say "Oh my God" a couple of times too, and his lines are just fantastic. If you haven't seen the "Alien" movies then you really don't need to, and it's not like they don't have any good films since.   I was in a pretty decent mood during this movie, and the mood did not last long. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In case you're thinking that the world has ended and/or a big bad demon has taken over Hollywood, think again. For one brief but memorable moment, I found myself completely immersed in a fantastically filmed story about a kid who lives by himself in an overgrown house in the middle of nowhere.  It's one of those movies that is too good to spoil, so I'm just going to leave you with this: It's a wonderful movie, that you could watch again and again and yet be completely entertained for the duration of a movie that should have been just a few years ago.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have not seen the movie this past weekend. It was shown during a recent movie marathon that ran the night before Christmas in a local theater. This is a pretty good movie. It is about a little girl named Kiki (Kathryn Hahn). Kiki and her mother (Melanie Griffith) are visiting her uncle (Paul Sorvino) in New York when she discovers he is a vampire. The vampire is a rich businessman (Ron Howard) who moves into Kiki's mother's new house. She learns of her uncle's secret but it isn't a big secret. The uncle is actually a vampire who has been sleeping in the bed Kiki was sleeping in until a vampire named Ben (Tom Selleck) has moved in with Kiki. Kiki thinks of a way to get Ben out so she goes to the store with a little blackboard and a picture of her little brother (Lionel Richie). She tells the little black board that she is going to make a blackboard with her big black brother but she ends up drawing a picture with black blood on it. The picture scares off the uncle and he leaves his little girl alone for a few minutes. Kiku thinks the picture is funny and tries it on a few people. After a while she gets tired and goes to bed. That's where the movie gets interesting. Kika tells her mother she is getting up but she is actually going to eat the little boy. Kiyoko (Janeane Garofalo) has a dream that she has a baby boy. She decides she should go to New York City and take care of the baby. Kihachi (David Arquette) is going with her on a fishing trip. The girl's mother (Jean Simmons) is a great catch and the two take him out for fishing. When Kiki sees what the mother is doing, she goes into a panic. Kikei (Burt Reynolds) a black-hooded murderer starts to stalk the pair. KIKI CASTLE (Kristy Swanson)  One of the most underrated horror movies ever made. This movie deserves much more praise then it gets for its good horror element. Kikis Castle is a story about a child's love for the color black which will result in the child's death one day. The director of the movie is a talented child actor (Kevin Spacey) called Michael McKean who was also a child star in the movies that he directed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Thing is about a creature who can be seen only in a cinema in a very special moment: it looks at the camera, in a moment of complete stillness, and it says to us that the future has not yet come. "   This is one of my favorite movies and, with a few exceptions, probably all of mine as well. This is a movie made in 1978 and the first one to feature Tobe Hooper, that great Danish director. The story is very short: The Thing is an industrial machine that looks human (it is) but is actually a biological experiment. It is made of a lot of pieces and is driven by a diesel engine which is powered by an electricity supply. The Thing lives in a building in the woods and is made to follow a man who has to be driven there and back with a rope ladder and a gas mask. On his journey, he encounters a woman and her dog. A very small amount of the movie is actually about the Thing and his adventure. Much more is told about the people who work in the machine, the other people he meets, the dog, the woman and the two dogs, and the scientist who runs the machine. What this movie does is very different from the others from this era: it is dark and moody, it is full of suspense and terror, but mostly it is fun to watch. This makes it a very good, if not the best, movie from the 1970s.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know about any other reviewer that has seen all the original Star Trek movies.  Well, at least the original series.  I loved them all and have long been looking forward to seeing them in the new Star Trek: The Next Generation.    I know it's long ago, but I still get a little nostalgic and it's very good to watch them again.  One of the most iconic shows of all time.  It has its own sense of humor and even though there were many different shows in the era, none had quite the impact of Star Trek.  So the re-boot is a welcome sight for fans that missed the good old days.  There is a lot to learn from this classic show and with the new series getting into the swing of things, we can expect a great time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As with the first two movies in the trilogy, the first movie in the series is not much more than a bunch of explosions, no character development, no real threat whatsoever to anybody's life, and not a whole lot to do.  I'll spare you the plot summaries and just describe what happens:  In a future where mankind's greatest achievement is the creation of the Matrix - a virtual reality designed to protect people from the world outside.  The world outside - aka The New World - is full of people who aren't human.  These people are robots that humans had implanted in them for their own protection.   The Matrix was the ultimate battle against these monsters, and humanity wins thanks to the help of the two people that saved it, Neo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Morpheus (Ed Harris).   Morpheus and Neo have a moment to themselves to talk about their relationship and whether Neo feels "a little bit" like Morpheus.  Mor is an ex-military guy who spent several years on a ship with him.  Neo is a computer hacker with a big head and a terrible sense of humour, and the two start hanging out and spending time together.  They get to talking about the New World and eventually become interested in it.  Their interest is not so much to stay and survive here as to stay in contact with people that might help them in the long run.  This is not an exciting movie, and it is fairly predictable.  But that does not detract from the fun that this movie has to offer.  I have watched this movie a few times over the years and I have never been disappointed in it, but I have always been very interested in what these characters were thinking and feeling.  There are a few interesting points to consider that I have not really addressed yet.   These characters come to the decision that they want to help the humans who are trapped inside the New York City.  When they go into the Matrix to help human refugees, they get a pretty nasty surprise:   It is an actual computer simulation of New York, and there is no "outside."    What they get instead is the real thing.  It's kind of like a video game where you have to run around, shooting people, eating, and dying like a bad movie cliché.  You don't even get the pleasure of the explosions and the cool looking robot characters that you would think you would when you
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've never seen much of a David Lynch film (except the Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me remake which I haven't seen either) but The Elephant Man is great to watch. It is creepy, dark, and scary. There is a great performance from the great Mark Rylance. You get a good sense of the danger. Lynch's trademark style of camerawork is the same as in The Elephant Men, only this time they used old color film negatives and only color, with a few black & white frames thrown in. It looks really good. I would have loved to see more David Lynch films.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There was a good deal of tension at times as the characters played games with each other and the plot moved along. The story was told in the style of a play, and the story itself was not much more than that. There were also a few lines of dialogue that were very long - a typical bad film. (See: The Wild Bunch.)       Overall:   I enjoyed the movie quite a bit. There are a number of scenes where the movie tries to make a statement, but fails (the film uses the word "dumb" more than a dozen times). The plot of the movie is pretty much one giant mess, and is completely irrelevant to the movie itself. There is no plot development, no growth in character development, and none of the main characters are developed at all. The only time the movie gets interesting is when the characters play games with one another (a variation of a game). The ending of the film is a pretty lame one and does not really fit with the rest of the story. This is a movie I would not recommend at all unless you don't have a high tolerance for bad movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. It is very entertaining and a great movie about a crazy crazy man. The story is good but it doesn't follow the movie. There is no tension. The characters are ridiculous and are made up for the film. I like watching the movie so I thought I'd rate it, but I'm not sure if I like the movie, maybe because this is a bad movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are a fan of the Harry Potter movies it is worth to see them again!   The acting is better than the books and the characters are still the same.   I also enjoyed Harry's reactions when the professor was being sarcastic to Harry and Hermione, but I also like that when they went to the house they were able to talk to the Dursleys (they were quite normal).   Harry does a wonderful job of making up for the books (although I like Harry better in the book, he was better and more funny in the movies, but this is probably my favorite of the bunch). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had never before seen a movie directed by a man.  Yet this is still a movie about a man, who lives the same life day after day and who can never escape the life that he's been born into.  The film begins with an old man who has had his life made into a story by a film critic, who tells him that he is going to write a book about his life.  One day he goes to the movies and there he meets an actress, who is in a car accident and loses an eye.  At the end of the movie, the old man sees a new car with a woman in it that he recognizes from the movie.  He tells the director that this woman must be his widow and the director tells him to let her in.  What follows is an adventure in love and a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For an action movie set in the 20 th century, there are not many gunfights.  These were the best action scenes in a long time.   I don't like seeing lots of action, but this is pretty damn good.  It's like a big action-movie without the silly humor.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those great "I don't know, it's really weird" movies. I mean, come on, it has the head of David Hasselhoff as a zombie and some sort of monster. This movie is weird in a lot of different ways. I'm not sure how to describe it, but it's a movie that has the feel of a classic. It's pretty entertaining. At one point I thought the lead actor and his girlfriend were in a love triangle, but I was wrong. It just seems like a fun movie that's over way too quickly. It has a lot going for it, and it's good to see a movie like this done by an artist that's able to be funny and smart. It wouldn't have been that bad without the funny/smart/bad combination.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For many, many years (as much as this is a PG-13 movie, which many are likely to not find appealing, despite the movie's good humor), there has been a show on TV called The Family.   The show's concept was simple:  A group of dysfunctional people living in a house in a bad neighborhood try to keep the peace, by making sure that no one bothers them.  The jokes, which were few and far between in the TV show (they were too similar to the jokes that were appearing in movies like "The Godfather," "The Beverly Hillbillies," and others), didn't seem to be able to fool the audience into believing the concept, and the ratings for the show were not very good.  As with all shows that were trying to be "couch" material, this wasn't the worst TV show ever, but it wasn't very good either.  There have been a few movies of this show that have done better, and some of these movies are still being produced, but this movie, starring Bruce Dern, was a bit of a flop (just like many of these early sitcoms).   It was an interesting premise, and I didn't mind Dern playing the part at all.  It also was interesting to see how this show was made.  The whole show was shot in one day, so it was really a one-day production.  One day shooting for a sitcom is something that we might not find that interesting, but a good one, if you can get it.  At the end of the day, the movie is enjoyable, and a bit funny.  Dern plays the part really well, even though he doesn't do it all that often, and while not being very good as an actor, he is good as the guy making the rules.  You have to like the movie to like this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Matrix" - a Matrix movie that takes on Christianity... The Matrix is based on a series of books by Phillip K. Dick, but is nothing like his classic. It has more in common with Stanley Kubrick's film "2001: A Space Odyssey" than Dick's classic.  The movie opens with an old man in a wheelchair, and a young woman with a baby strapped to her.  (The woman is played by Carrie Fisher, who does a terrific job).   We see a number of things. One thing we notice is how incredibly advanced the computers are. The computers are basically on a planet similar to Earth, which is like a giant computer. The planet is governed by a man, with an extremely powerful (at least in this world) computer in the center. The man (a priest) is like Jesus Christ in the sense that he is all-powerful. But unlike Christ, he is not Jesus, but rather an evil programmer who uses the computer to do all his evil deeds. He has created a world full of evil and darkness where the only good people are the ones that have been programmed into thinking that they are good.  The whole story takes place in the first 3 minutes. The movie starts off as a classic sci-fi action movie. It is pretty basic in plot and basic in concept. But it is good. It shows you what the world is like from the point of view of the computer. It starts out with the usual sci- fi action scenes, and then goes into a kind of spiritual world. I don't know what kind of movies this movie is, but in that world, the evil priest/programmer is the source of all evil. He creates these things through his mind. The priest and the program (who really works for him) are essentially a man and a program. The computer is the only true good in that bad world. In other words, everything good in the world comes from the computer (which is the computer's brain).   And the good people in this bad world are just people (programs) that have their minds (or souls) programmed by the evil/good computer.   This movie shows the consequences of using evil and evil programs. In this world, there are all these people who have their lives "programmed". They don't understand what they are doing. In many cases, these people have been "programed" to commit evil deeds... including killing a whole bunch of people.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are a fan of the TV show Doctor Who you have to give this a go.

The story is good and the Doctor was in the right place at the right time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies you feel like you've seen it a million times, but never forget its brilliance.  This movie, for me, was really a revelation.  It reminded me of something I had only ever seen the short film "Nightmare Before Christmas" a few years ago.  The movie was about a group of people who go on a camping trip to a remote location.  One night they are attacked by the local animals (they are supposed to be on vacation from the city) and while the others fight off the animals, the one girl (I forgot her name, but she was pretty awesome) falls into a coma.  She awakens the next day and is told she has to stay the night at a cabin...which turns out to be haunted.  But, what really set this movie apart from the others is its soundtrack.  For me this was one of the most haunting movies I have ever seen.  I would watch it every summer.  There is really no need to make a movie about the same story over and over again, because if it weren't for "Jaws" this movie would've been forgotten long ago.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought this film was really, really good, but not a perfect one. It had some great performances, great cinematography and even though it was shot with the '50s in mind, it had a great vibe. The plot was interesting, but the story was just too slow, boring and tedious for my taste. The film had some fantastic one-liners that would have been perfect in a comic book, but in a film no less. I enjoyed this film more than I did The Black Stallion, but I think it is really a film only a really small handful of people will like. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think that people who are familiar with the series will instantly recognize the film and have no trouble making the connection, which of course is to say it's an homage to the movie Star Wars.   It certainly looks like it's been shot there, with those same space scenes and that sort of darkly futuristic feel.   Of course, it isn't really space as you think and much of the action takes place on a planet with a huge, floating rock floating out from the center.  (If that doesn't immediately ring a bell, you're not an adult at heart.)   This movie is fun.  And I'm glad that someone has decided to adapt it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was an interesting movie with a plot that kept me on the edge of my seat. A guy gets into trouble trying to make a film about his girlfriend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you want an entertaining movie, then this is the kind of movie you should try.   The movie is about two brothers, one of them is a doctor and the other a musician.  A man has to be pulled out of bed and get a doctor's appointment.  When he gets to the clinic the doctor tells him to wait a bit because the doctor is going to be out of town.  The doctor gets in his car and drives away.  When he gets home he finds the family sitting in their living room.  They look at the doctor in a puzzled way.  Then a strange feeling comes over the doctor as the man's sister, a woman, comes over to him.  She tells him that she is a "monster."  This doesn't surprise the doctor since his sister had been in the hospital before.  He tells the family about her, and says that she has been in a wheelchair since childhood.  But the family believes the doctor.  After the family leaves the doctor goes back to his car.  As he is leaving his car a strange man walks in, a man who is bald but has the body of a gorilla.  This man says he is called The King, and that he is about to make a movie.  All of the family is scared and confused.  Later in the movie when the "King" leaves, he gives everyone a picture of a movie monster which they all keep.  That night when everyone is asleep, the house is haunted.  And so begins a year in the life of a family that has become confused in the darkness. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It has a really good story and has enough suspense to keep the viewer at the edge of his/her seat for the whole movie, it's really an original story about a man who tries to get revenge on an ex girlfriend.  It doesn't need much to make the movie good, it just needs to stay alive and I hope that it gets a sequel.

It also has a good action-adventure plot and the ending was a surprise.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a bit surprising how well this is received. A pretty good movie about a decent movie: it follows in the tradition of other excellent films made in this period, it features plenty of wonderful performances and it's one of the few films from the late 50s where the actors and director were able to work together without a hitch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed this film a lot. Not all the characters were well done. I think one of the main reasons that this story didn't get very many Academy Awards is that it was a bit cliche. In my opinion, this movie made some great movies:   And it's a great movie. But the problem is that one of its main themes that they put a lot of energy into, a theme about the freedom that comes with being a woman in the early 1950's is also that of being trapped. They put lots of energy and passion into that theme, and for a brief moment in time the movie was able to be a lot more interesting. But as soon as the movie starts it stops being funny and starts being sad. It's sad because it's about a woman being trapped in a very small town and stuck in a marriage with a man who doesn't value her. It was one of those movies that could have made a lot a difference in this country. It would have changed the lives of so many women. It is one of only two films I've seen that has made a difference to the lives and the views of women, it's not the only one by any means but this was a film that made a little difference to me.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It would have been more fun to make a movie about the adventures of a boy and his puppy who are captured by a group of wild people and taken to a city full of dinosaurs, but as I said earlier this is not a realistic movie. The dinosaurs have all come to life so they can eat the children in the zoo. When the boy, who is still a boy, shows the child in the boy's classroom that dinosaurs are not wild they are just a bunch of silly toys (you can see why it is so popular) the little girl tells the boy that his dinosaur is not wild, he is tame... a very old saying in English about a very silly time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's an old movie, but it's an entertaining old movie.  The movie starts out with a young man, Jack, and his family driving home from the movies. Jack's father, Charles, is in the driver's seat. At the beginning of the movie Jack tells his wife, Anna, that he will take a long nap before he goes to bed. However he sleeps, and he has a dream about his parents when he wakes.    In the dream Anna's father is a handsome man.  When Jack wakes up Jack's mother has gone to visit her parents.  Jack takes Anna in to the car and he finds out from a neighbor that his parents are dead.  Anna and Jack get married at a very early age and Anna tells her husband about her dreams about her parents in the dream.  At the end of the film the main character Anna has an accident that she dies of.  She tells Jack about her dream so Jack believes it too. He goes out looking for his parents in order to find out about his dream but he never finds them.  And that is about it.  I liked it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first half of the movie is a lot of silly fun. The second half, which involves a group of aliens called the "Jedis", has a lot going on that is a very interesting story, especially for the science fiction genre. The script is good, and the film is good. It doesn't quite make me an alien-hunter like James Cameron's other movie, but I can see the influence, and if the movie was a little longer I think it would have been better and I'd like to see more of this.

(Note that, due to technical difficulties in filming, the film has to be shown in a somewhat altered form - I'm afraid it's not possible to see much more than the first 20 minutes of the film - though you can find out more about the film via the DVD release.  I also feel the film is a bit too self-serious for this sort of story; I'd rather the film had been about a couple of friends who are forced to do a nasty bit of work.  In an early scene, the main character has to pretend to take a selfie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first film I saw about a former soldier, and now writer, fighting a criminal. It was a good story, but I found it difficult to follow, because there was too much stuff going on. I would like to have seen more of the war. As it turned out, it was a great story.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you haven't seen this, I recommend it! It's a very good thriller that has great acting. I think it may be the best John Wick movie of all-time. I love the action sequences and it's one of the best action films out there. I've already seen it twice. It would be great to see a John Wick sequel as well.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "You see, my sister and I got into trouble. My sister was in a really bad mood, and when I was in school one day, we saw a movie called "The Wizard of Oz." You know what we were thinking? This is an excellent way to get a good laugh. But I don't know about laughing, and I certainly didn't laugh. There were no laughs in "The Magic of Oz" at all, and in fact all I remember is seeing the wizard and his pals chasing a little girl that had run away with a snake. I was sick and tired of seeing these people. I couldn't believe that a movie like this was being made at the time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very faithful adaptation of the comic strip. It's an excellent comic, filled with humor and sarcasm. It has a fantastic cast.   I like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was great, and I loved how it was made.  I thought that the first person, third-person narration was great.    The fact that they managed to capture the essence of the first Star Wars with only three short films is a feat of filmmaking. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first thing you notice about it is the color, or should I say the colors? It seems to be one shade of blue. And that's not even one shade. It's all blue! And the lighting is so bad that you can hardly see anyone around. Well, I should think that's bad enough. But then, what really gets you is how completely it plays out like a "Theatrical" version. No action, no fights, no nothing. It is so over the top that it could have been pulled from the pages of a comic book and that, my friends, is how good it is.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie.  It is a good story with great acting by Tom Cruise.       My only nitpick is that the movie is a lot less exciting than the plot suggests it would be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best one!   I think it was all my fault, I was so in love with this movie and it was the one movie to which I was most looking forward, well, almost as much as I was in love myself.   This movie was so good! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found this movie to be a great little tale. I'd like to say, for a movie about a girl that wants to be free of a life she's living, it has a number of very strong scenes. The main character of Alice wants to do everything she can to help in the fight against the war. She and her friends are always fighting for their rights to live, even if they're trying to get killed. The film also deals with many different types of people, some good, some bad and most people who seem to be living like they're on a film set. Alice has to learn to deal with people who are not interested in anything other than making money and destroying people's lives. In fact, even when she does some good deeds, people think she's the enemy. Her friends help her deal with these issues, like when one of her friends was in a bad mood and wanted to destroy the house with a huge bomb. Alice is always trying to do the right thing. She can't just do it and then turn around and do it the wrong way. It can't be about her and about her alone. Alice just wants to live the life she deserves to live.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A film with a great story, great acting, and a very emotional ending. A must see film for those who like horror, great story and even better performances. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story isn't the best, and it doesn't have a lot of "wow" moments.  However, I still think it is one of the funniest comedies that I have ever seen.  This is not only the perfect way to end the year but also a very poignant ending to the movie.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have always been a fan of horror films but I have been very disappointed with the recent releases.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As far as I am concerned this is the greatest American classic of all time. I don't want to talk about the acting, because it is all there. It's the best performance I have seen ever by an American actor.  The story is a masterpiece of a movie.  It tells the story of a black sailor who is in the Navy and decides to run away with a beautiful girl of mixed race.  He goes around the East Coast and then on to the West Coast and does a wonderful job of being both an adventurer and a comic, the best in the film.  There is also a great scene where he tells a story of running away with his girlfriend, who, as an African, is very different from him.  This is a wonderful movie and there is plenty of laughs to go around.  One thing that I don�t think is noted much is that this movie was actually made for the big screen as a comedy.  At the end of it they actually go to a theater and have the audience stand up to laugh with them and see them lose and run away.  I wish this movie had been made a few years later for small screens, but it worked out well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie. I liked the original "Porky's" and I liked this one. I enjoyed it.   "Ponyo" is the third film produced by Takashi Miike (whose previous two are not too shabby). A tale of a young boy who finds a rabbit (which he names "Pon-Pon") stuck in a tree in his hometown in a small town called Tampines. As he walks home he sees a beautiful young girl, Pon-Pun, in the bushes in front of her house. She invites him over, and in an orgy of passionate passion he learns that she is not a human after all. So why is Pon-Pac "living in her garden with rabbits all over" in a large house? Because her family keeps them alive and well to use in the festival held each year in the village, where the local nobleman and his daughter have a lavish party for all the villagers to enjoy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very good movie!  I am very interested in the world-building, because it doesn't follow the pattern of Star Wars. The worldbuilding is more interesting because it is more diverse and a lot of things you can find in other movies (in the same genre) but are not really explored.  It is interesting to see many different cultures and different peoples of a different time, but it is also interesting to find out the main character's background. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my all-time favourite stories. The entire movie is absolutely amazing. It's very sad to see it go. I had no idea there was so much bad horror out there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is not the usual film of the gangster film. It is more like a movie of an everyday man who is so stupid that he wants to become a real murderer.  The movie is really not bad, but it has a funny ending which you will laugh at and also see how he gets caught. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A well-done action film, with a good cast and a well-paced plot.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really liked this movie and it wasn't just that. It was a great movie for it's time and it has a great storyline with great acting and a great screenplay.  So when I first heard about this movie I couldn't think of much to write about it and then I saw the trailer and I thought "this is a good one."  When this movie came out it came out with a lot of hype because it was a big-budget movie and all of this hype meant that it had to be good.  There are a lot a bad movies out there.  If you were looking for a great big-brained space adventure film with a great plot, a good story, a great cast, and great acting this was not your movie.  At the time I was watching this I really didn't think much of it and now I can't imagine having anything else to do with the day.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was a big hit. If your a fan of horror/drama, then you'll love it. I was really happy with it as it was one of those scary movies that never made me sleep or scare me and it didn't really give me a creepy vibe. I thought it was fun and the ending was really funny.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, this movie is good.   It is funny, but not in a corny way.  The dialogues and gags are great.  If you like movies that make you laugh and have good dialogues, this is a movie you will like. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very good movie with a strong moral, strong theme and well made.   This is a good film, it's not as good as the best films of the 1930's and 1940's, but it still is a very good film.  It has the same themes as the great movies of the 30's.  For example, "The Great Train Robbery".  The first half is very good, very moving and emotional.  The second half is one of those great American westerns, filled with beautiful and tragic characters.  A great film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was okay and had the elements that made me really like these kinds of movies and I had a few fun times laughing and listening to the songs.    The movie really takes the theme from the title and adds a fun and funky twist to it that kept me entertained for a good 2 or 3 hours.  The actors are the kind of actors you know well in films and they are very good and have a lot of fun in this movie.  This movie had a good mix of the usual things I like and the things I don't like and is definitely a movie I will watch again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved it.   A very funny and heartfelt movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a film from the late 70's about the early days of a new generation of punk rockers, the film is a fun-filled romp about the punk culture in the mid-80's.   This film stars The Ramones, the Bad Seeds and the Offspring with Gary Busey as the head of the new punk movement. The movie is set in New York City in 1981 as the Bad Seed is starting off as a new band from Boston.  The movie follows the punk rock life and shows a lot of the funny situations that happen in the punk scene.  It has some great performances and a fun story line.  This movie should be on my must watch list if you liked the 1980's punk scene and are up for some fun!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A nice, very entertaining film. As a science fiction film, it is quite excellent. For the most part, the movie is an action movie, but it also has a good story. It's not perfect, as the character is a bit too realistic for my taste, but at least it tries to keep up with modern technology.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie that is very similar to the classic film "The Sting" - just without the Sting and a different ending (and with a little less humor - but more emotion) - and the reason why I like this film is the very strong acting from all of the actors - the best acting I have ever seen from a movie set in Africa, and in the end it is clear that the makers of this film are just as good as the actors they have chosen to play the parts. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be honest, I only had watched this because I knew it was on TV, so I took the time to watch it. I don't usually like old war movies. I'm not a fan of action movies. But, I did find this to be interesting. I also enjoyed the action scenes. I'd like to see a sequel, perhaps to this movie. I would like to have seen a female soldier take her place, and a female character (in this case a woman) is a role that can be played by anybody. As far as I can see, the only character who was played by a man was the German officer and a few other characters. The only female character was also a role which could be played almost anywhere. I did have some difficulties watching the movie, due to my poor German, but I did enjoy it. It was not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is probably one of the best I have seen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For what it is: a comedy movie about a man (Jeff Daniels) who is in a car accident and must spend a year recovering in a mental institution. (He actually spends a year in a hospital before being released.) It is also about the two men trying to get a divorce: his sister has married a guy (Tom Hanks), and he's looking to be set up with his niece, played by Anne Bancroft. (You can never have too much "cougar drama"...) I was a little concerned by the casting of Bancroe because it's a good-looking girl with an accent, but I didn't find her unattractive either. And she's really sweet as the sister, who has a hard time staying in the hospital. I thought it was very funny and a good ending to an amusing, somewhat funny movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I've said before in these reviews, I really enjoy this movie. The story is great and the acting is quite good. The acting in the movie makes me laugh each time. It is an enjoyable movie and I really recommend watching it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this movie I was in my early teens and it was still quite a ways from being a cult movie. It wasn't until I saw it again years later that I realized just how good this movie is.   As far as the plot goes, it's about a girl in a small town in Colorado who meets a strange man (the lead actor) that she has a strange relation to. It's about an encounter between the two. It doesn't really delve into any of the other characters involved, other than the lead actor who happens to be the film's only black character. This was a low budget film made in the 1950's where the only money that was made was the filming costs and the actors were paid peanuts. The movie was only seen by a small group of friends in Colorado at the time, who made a movie of it. I'm sure this movie would have been better off as a radio drama.  The opening sequence shows us the "hottie" who is the film star, Miss Audrey and she is playing a part that seems to be more of a parody of a movie star then a "real" movie star.  What makes this movie so great, aside from the acting, is the use of a black character who doesn't play a part in the plot.   It has to be seen to be believed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's title comes from the song The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea by the Barenaked Ladies:  It's basically a Western that's got its story in the first twenty minutes. It's pretty good! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best action/sci-fi movies of the 1980s, The Road Warrior is an entertaining and unique Western and a great movie to show to anyone interested in the genre. It has a few flaws, especially in the pacing, but those are few and far between. This movie also has a great soundtrack with a lot of great songs that I personally had the pleasure of listening to again and again. If you enjoyed the previous films in the trilogy (and you should) then you owe it to yourself to give this one a try. Just don't expect too much because of its limited budget. It is a fun Western, not only for Westerners, but also for anyone who likes Westerns in general. It's also a great way to end the trilogy, although I didn't get to the end of the movie. And it is also a good way to pick up the franchise after The Final Sacrifice and The Redemption.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very good movie that will stay with you for awhile.  The film follows a man on a quest to cure his mother's cancer.   It's a very good film and will stay in your mind for a long time.  This is not a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie before I bought the collector's edition DVD. It is a fun little movie. It's a good laugh! A little like those little cartoon movies of the 50s. I also think there is a little bit of a message that could be useful. My wife laughed so much. I did not like the movie. The little girl looks like a little girl.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film, made by Stanley Kramer and starring Jack Nicholson, has an interesting premise: a man is murdered and there are many theories on who could be responsible. One of them is a young woman and she wants to prove that she is not the murderer, but she has very little money and no witnesses. However, she does see a man running away from the scene who seems to be pointing a gun at her. The man, Peter Fonda, has a big nose and a very funny voice. He is also a very strong actor and his performance is the reason this movie works. He has an incredible physique, but a poor sense of humor. It is fun to watch and is definitely worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a wonderful film about a man and a little girl who go to visit a great old aunt who resides in a remote village in the middle of the wilderness. The little girl has not been in the picture for long. She is the daughter of a very old lady who is now in her mid- 80's and has been in this village as long as she is. This is also the place in which the young boy made his first appearance and where his mother lives too. It is a nice picture which has a great deal of good drama. The movie takes place in early summer of 1934 and is set during the year when the American Civil War was winding its way through the States. This film is one of those little movies which is a treat for the eyes. The scenes are well chosen and the performances are as good as can be expected.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm very glad that this film took the time to capture me with a truly impressive story. It's interesting that this movie is considered a cult classic even though the film is an old one and this movie was filmed in the late 1940s so it was shot in black and white and at that time it was really difficult to capture the mood of the movie. The movie is a fantastic thriller with some very memorable scenes of this movie.   This movie is truly a masterpiece. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was not expecting much when I bought the movie from a kiosk. I'm not a fan of the kind of films they make these days and they have never worked out to be my cup of tea so far. Well, the first thirty minutes were a bore but after that I got into it and the rest was good fun. I love that this kind of movie is still made. It makes me happy to be alive.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are times where I feel like I'm being told a story for the first time.  I was introduced to a group of teens at a small school who were all very different.    In the beginning, it was a group who were trying to be cool, and it was not long before they were taking things seriously.  They began to hang out at a local restaurant, where they tried to impress their new friend.  There was a scene where one of the students was hanging out with a guy that was more concerned about having a good time at the bar than what the next day's classes would consist of.  In a funny scene, the teacher asks to borrow his students for the day.  He has to borrow one of them because she had a car accident a few days prior.  I won't say more about it, because it is a great movie and should be watched over and over again.  It is a good idea for a movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . I watched the movie after I found out that it was a remake of an old John Frankenheimer movie that the director had wanted to remake for a long time and it really was an old fashioned John Frankenreiner movie!   If you have never seen an old movie, don't worry as it doesn't take more than a few minutes for you to become captivated. I was really looking forward to seeing an American remake of a German classic that had been a classic since 1938. I have to give a shoutout to James Garner as John Frankenberger!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The opening is beautiful:   It's a long, dark and stormy night in London, and the only way the film gets any mood is through a good score.   When an old lady is looking for her niece, and a little boy is trying to convince her that there's a giant rat in her house, well, the only possible way to make the scene more interesting is to introduce a bunch of people looking like they'd be better friends with the old lady than with the little boy.  So, in the end the old woman and her niece manage to escape from this place... by jumping out of a window.    This was definitely a better movie than that bad old  one from the 80's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved all the little details that make up this film. The small town of El Paso has a reputation for bad luck and a bad lot of troublemakers. This is the story of a little boy whose home life is turned upside down when his parents are killed in the shooting. When a local gang of cowboys come to take revenge on them, a brave kid who just happens to be one of the killers is left to fend for himself. What makes it even more interesting is that this little kid is a robot. With a little help from his brother, a girl, and a robot cat, the little kid ends up saving the town in the end. If you can get past the awful acting, the bad special effects, and the slow pace, you'll have a fun and very entertaining film. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but I think this is one of those rare gems that just seem to appear out of the blue. I also enjoy watching the good characters go against each other. The film is kind of a rip-off of "The Matrix" in many ways, but at least that movie came across as a story that was told very well.

The action scene in The World Is Not Enough was a treat. What surprised me, however, was how realistic the acting was. Yes, the Bond films are filled with big explosions, but at least they give you an excuse to shout in glee when 007 saves the day. Not this one.

The movie is very well done.    Zoolander is played by  Chris O'Dowd.   Chris O is no stranger to making movies, having played one of the main characters in "Kung Fu Panda".   His performance is excellent.  Chris's character has a lot of lines.  They are funny, but also kind of touching.    Chris is a really great actor, and he gets to play another great role this time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a good time.  I haven't seen much of this director but he is one that I have gotten to know over the years.  The film is about a police officer whose partner, a cop from another town, has died and he has to help his best friend to be able to move his girlfriend to a town with a big drug problem.  He moves from town to town.  I found that there were a lot of things that were left out, like who is the "good cop" and the "bad cop".  If there were more "good cops" I wonder if the movie would have been so interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a huge fan of these old sci-fi movies and love the old B movie stuff like the first Alien, which was a great movie, I just wish they would get a second one made now that they are having a little reboot. It's an old time movie and I enjoyed it. The plot is a little bit too obscure for me, it takes place in an underground city that has been destroyed by a flood. It is now underground and is the lair of the Alien queen. One of the guys who comes to help is an old astronaut named John Hurt. In the beginning of the movie John Hurt has a near death experience with the Alien and is brought up by the Queen. She keeps him alive with some kind of parasite. When John Hurt goes into space he encounters a spaceship and manages to destroy it with a rocket launcher. John Hurt gets back to earth where his friends are and gets some food and a place to sleep. John doesn't remember everything about that night he spent with the Queen, but he does remember the thing that killed him and it is the only thing that kills the Alien Queen. When this happens John realizes what he is going to do with his life. He goes to work for the space program and gets promoted. His old friend, the astronaut, shows up a little late at night and John is afraid that he is not as interested in John Hurt's new career as he was about him before. The astronaut shows John pictures that show that there is an alien life form and John realizes that John Hurt must be the only man in the entire country who knows about it. He has to get the alien back and take the Queen with him so that he can get it away from Earth. He finds that the alien is still on Earth and the Queen is not dead, so John must go into another alien dimension that the Queen can't get to. John finds out that there are several people like himself who know about the alien and that they live on different planets that are about to get destroyed by the Alien, so this is an opportunity to get back at the Queen by killing the Alien. John learns of another alien, but it is still asleep. So John must find another alien and kill him and get it out of this dimension and bring it with him back to Earth. John gets some help from a very young girl named Annie and from some women in a bar. The Alien kills a lot of people before they finally get it in an army truck. There are a lot
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have not seen a film quite so entertaining since "Kramer vs. Kramer" (1993), but this movie is so silly and over-the-top that I almost forgot that it is based on a play by Woody Allen. It's very amusing to watch Allen in his element, which he usually isn't. He is one of those actors who does not need special effects. He can do this stuff in his sleep. He even plays himself in a few scenes, which is pretty cool. The movie has a lot of funny characters, which you won't find in a lot "funny movies." It features a very catchy tune, and the whole thing is set in a real theater in New York. If you want to see a good, silly movie, go to see "It Happened One Night." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is about a little boy's dog who gets his legs crushed by a car as he runs out to see the rain at the top of a hill. He is found by a lady who uses a pair of scissors to cut his limp body back together and takes him to the vet. The lady and her husband are surprised to find the dog seems to have a heart of gold. When they find out he has been saved from a terrible accident, they give him the gift of a new life by taking him to a park that has been created for him.   In short, this movie is a fun little story about the bond between a puppy and a dog.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is an old movie about the American west.  We meet our main character who is a man who has always been lost.    His mother remarried and then divorced and he has always had two or three odd jobs a year.  He is an avid hunter.  For most of the film we follow him, through all sorts of adventures, through wilds of wild people, over the desert plains.      I loved the setting, the costumes,   the location work,  all of it, and I loved how the characters felt and acted.  The actors all do a good job of conveying their emotions well.  We see the two hunters, as they hunt one of their "guides" through the desert.  The two men, like everyone else, feel the effects of age,  and the physical demands on them.  They are forced to rely on their knowledge and the power of their skill to navigate the various obstacles in their path.  At times we see them as they are going down the drain.  It looks as if the two may not survive their journey as they struggle to carry their heavy packs for the final stretch.  Their journey is full of dangers and they must fight to keep themselves alive.  These two seem to fall into all of the traps set up by the "villain."   When their wagon breaks down on a trail they are forced into the water and we see their struggle.  When the two are forced onto the sand dunes we see the effects that being on dry land has on them,  as they suffer from fatigue and the effects their age.  Even on a hot day, in one of the hottest days of the year, the two men find that they are covered in sand.  That makes sense because they are in the desert,    in the hottest part of the desert and the sun is beating down on them with a vengeance.  In one of my favorite parts of the movie, we see some of the local people on the outskirts of town come to a halt to see a strange sight.  There is a large body of water nearby.  While the people are watching, the men and their dogs swim up to the water's edge, where they pull out a gun and open fire.  One man is shot instantly and it appears that he is already dead.  But a nearby man has managed to pull out his revolver,  shoot the other

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In my mind, this is a great movie. It has a plot that is original and well thought-out and even the characters don't take long to grow on you. I think it's a movie which is very safe for kids at the beginning but gets harder and harder to like as the picture gets deeper into its story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's been a while since I saw "Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace."  It was my first introduction to the world of the "Phantom Menace," the movie that set the bar for everything from fantasy to action to humor to comedy.  I'll confess right now that I had absolutely no idea who Jar Jar Binks was. I did have a little idea that he was a little weird but nothing that remotely gave me an idea of who this character was.  This was a movie that I was very excited for and I remember seeing it with my mom.  It had a really great opening scene with a big space battle with a lot of explosions.  Then the film was over and we could just watch the kids go to school.  The story was fun, the humor, clever and it had a real sense of realism.  My mom said to me that that was exactly what I wanted out of a movie.  So I bought the DVD right away and I watched the movie every night before bed.   I had never read anything about Jar Jar even on the internet so I did a lot to find out about him.  Jar Jar's name was a reference to Naboo. The planet was part of the Naboo system.  Naboo was also where the planet of Tatooine was.    This reference to Tatooin was probably my favorite thing about Jar-Jar.  We get to see his family and how the old days were like.  He's so funny but then you watch his reaction to things. It's not like I thought he was really that silly.  Some of the things he said were pretty funny.  When Darth Maul shows up with his "Death Star" in the background and is yelling, I thought, "that's Jar Jar in the Death Star!"  It didn't end up being in the movie but it was still funny. This is a fun film that shows us more about the characters than we probably ever could have imagined. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A beautiful and moving tale about the love between two young lovers.   And the romance of love, in a nutshell.  This film shows us two lovers who share one another's love as if they were born for each other.  The two main characters are the main focus of the film.  We first see them at a university.  They go on a hike at night.  It's a peaceful hike, when they get lost and in need of help.   They meet a strange girl and fall in love.  When the girl leaves them at night and goes back to her mother's house, the two of them are very heartbroken.  So they decide to go to a park to get away from it all, only to come to the realization that the park is a prison.  And it is a beautiful one, as well as very dangerous.  These two lovers finally find solace in a beautiful waterfall.  Their romance has lasted for all eternity.  A very touching and touching romance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a funny movie about an old-fashioned movie studio trying to keep its reputation by creating a good-looking movie. It's got a couple of laughs but mostly is quite silly. The only thing I would complain about is the fact that the woman (who was in one of the movies in the film) was played by a woman. The other people in the movie are in fact all men.  Share this: Facebook  Twitter
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the greatest films ever made. It has the perfect mix of humor, action and romance. The humor is the only thing that's lacking. There is a lot of humor here, as usual, but I feel that it is not enough to make this film stand out from the other comedies that were made at the time. It is probably the best film ever made about a woman trying to find her true love, and there is no denying that. It was the most popular silent movie ever made until the silent era ended. Many people have been saying how great the film was ever since it was released. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not going to lie about this movie: it's awful. It makes the film "The Exorcist", but with the actors who actually played the part and the horrible, terrible production values and acting of the director.   This is a great shame because the movie, at least the ending, is actually decent (although still horrible). But, after the film has finished and you've watched the credits roll (I think it ends in about 10 seconds from the time this was made), it's time to sit down and think about all that horrible horrible, horrible, trash that the film is.  This was the result of a movie from the directors who did the very same thing to "Swingers", and you had better go back and see that movie to see what a mess the "original" movie was. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was a film I never really got involved in, and I have no idea why.  It's just a good ol' fashioned gangster movie, no other thoughts there, right?  But once I saw the credits roll on the end of the film, I was completely blown away.    There was a reason that the films had all been made at once; it showed that the filmmakers could do more than one film a year, if need be.  It was a real shame that the producers didn't get around to the sequel to this film, which would have been a fun follow-up to the film that started it all, but they probably just didn't feel like it at the time.  In any case, I would love to see this on TV sometime, but it has the look of a great film without the spirit. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen these two films so many times that I've become almost an expert at them.  If you've seen them before you know exactly where this is going, but I'm going to take you on a little trip down memory lane, just to give you a taste of my love of these movies.  If you were to watch the following scene with a single shot of the scene, a single line, I wouldn't be surprised if you'd be saying,  "wow this scene must have been quite a shock!"   This scene in particular,   is one of the highlights of the movie.   I am going to give the film a 8 because of how well it all fits together.  As for me,    I loved it,  I'm sure everyone who has ever seen it will love it as well.  There are some really good scenes in there,  and I recommend watching the entire film once you've watched the first couple of scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film has much of the charm of it's predecessor, but with a less heavy touch. The film opens with the typical opening sequence. The camera zooms slowly across the desert while the sound of a woman playing a stringed instrument (in this case a violin) is heard on the soundtrack. In this setting, the desert is almost as beautiful as the ocean; it is not as cold, nor as unforgiving as the Arctic.   There is one scene of intense activity: a desert man has shot three people dead with a pistol. One of the men is shot in the back of the head, causing him to fall out of a tree.  In the first few seconds of the film there is a brief bit of humor that was almost out of place: the character "A" is sitting on a rock, looking up at the sky and wondering if he is going to die. This is a rather strange opening scene, but it helps to establish the sense that we are watching a film that has been made for an audience, rather than for the benefit of the actors.  A man's face is seen in the sky; he is holding a rifle.  The scene ends with the narrator (who, like in the first film, is played by a man in a white turban) asking:  Why have so many desert people died?  The story focuses on three different protagonists: the two who died (a desert man and a man who tried to escape from the desert; but fell into it instead) and the three who were wounded (a young man, a young woman and a young boy)       The three wounded are found, in a remote part of the desert, while they are sleeping. The wounded are saved from death by the two women: the one who was stabbed in the stomach by the man is saved, but her wound is extremely severe. The two women are so devoted to this man that they make sure he knows about their existence, to the extent that he has to ask about the location of the wounded woman to find out where she is.      The two wounded are taken to the hospital; both are dead when the story ends.  What does the film make of the situation? The desert man is portrayed by a relatively unknown actor: the man who is shot was famous in Morocco as a desert hero who had defeated seven bandits.  It is an interesting film: it does not take itself too seriously. But the film
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If there is one movie that needs to be seen more often it is this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw The Wolf of Wall Street and I loved it.  The Wolf and I didn't know each other. But I loved the movie.   In it, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), a struggling hedge fund manager, takes a job in the City. He meets Jordan Belmont (Leonard DiCaprieio), a young, beautiful woman, who works as a prostitute for $100,000 a year. Belmont is rich and wants to do good.  After spending $500,000 of his own money on Belmont, Belmont decides to take matters into his own hands: he buys the hotel Belmont had hoped to buy, but doesn't have the money for, and convinces the hotel's owner to do a deal with him to sell it. A couple weeks later Belmont has enough cash to move on to more real estate deals, but the people who are supposed to take over the hotel keep making a mess of it. Belmond is forced to make a couple of quick calculations on the spot to make sure they don't make a big mistake.  Belmond, in particular, is not a good actor.  In fact, he seems too good-looking and too good to be a pimp.  But he is not evil. He really is an average guy trying to make his way in this strange world.  That's why the movie doesn't work. It is an excellent movie; you should watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are plenty of good movies, but I thought this one was rather good. The main character, named Jann, is a poor country boy who is brought to a city to work as a blacksmith. His father (played by Robert Mitchum) is a man who has been in charge of a black-and-white TV shop in a small town, long ago. Jann is a little spoiled, but, as with a lot of little kids, he is easily taken by the rich people around him, and eventually he is taken away to live with them. While living with them, Jann's father comes to love him, as does he. But, his new love is also very jealous. So, Jansen comes to see the rich man's daughter for the first time. In the meantime, the girl Jann was living with dies mysteriously, and Jann takes revenge on the rich family, with deadly results. I can understand why Jann would be jealous about a girl. She is attractive. She has a good personality. In addition, she has a lot to do. She works in the local hospital, and then, she goes to work at a local hospital to make a small fortune. This sounds like fun, but Jansen has to deal with being raised by these very rich people, and being very jealous, and trying to take revenge. This is a very enjoyable movie that I think most kids will enjoy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is no denying that it is one of the funniest and most bizarre films that the '70s had to offer. Even if you are not a fan of comedy, it is impossible to go through the film without laughing at the ridiculous things that are happening. There is one scene in the film which is so absurd, it has to be seen to be believed. Two women, who look to be middle aged, are having sex with a small child that is between the ages of six and seven. One of the women begins to give the child a blowjob and ends up with it having the same sort of intercourse that the mother was having with the child. It may not be the most realistic depiction of the act that has ever been done, but I doubt that anyone will ever think it was anything but fun and ridiculous. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm glad I went to see this movie. It has a lot of fun with the characters and the movie is well made. It's not your standard, boring thriller by any stretch of the imagination. It does things that are pretty unique and I'll watch it again just to see what happened next. The film follows two detectives on a little job to get some information on a man who shot up a local diner, killing one of his customers. This leads them to discover that there is a connection between the two. After a trip to the lake, we discover why the murder happened: the killer is hiding out there. It gets interesting, if nothing else.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had read a little about The Big Lebowski and felt that I would like it. I have to say that it's a very funny movie. It is not "out there" as far as genre goes. It has very little dialogue, almost no gore, and very little humor. That's about all that I can say about it. This is not a good film. I had to pause it at the very end because it got out of hand. I wouldn't recommend it to a family film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very entertaining adventure starring an eccentric guy who takes his daughter (the actress) out on the weekends and lets her watch some pretty silly films with some actors and a bit of silliness.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're looking for a good "good film" with little to nothing else to offer, take a look at The Secret of NIMH. A film that is so completely and utterly hilarious, you won't care what happens.   In addition to being hilarious, it's also a good science fiction story. It was great to see a great writer like William Sleator (who did a bunch of great stuff, like Misfits  and The Star-Spangled Man) back directing a live-action movie.  The film was produced by Walter H. Miller Productions, and was also a member of the  Sci-Fi Channel  as part of its lineup of movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To make up for the lack of a good screenplay, or worse, the script itself, this movie is good. I know many people who have seen it, and none of them liked it. My impression was that the author wanted to put himself in the position of someone watching a bad movie. And he succeeded, with an audience of mostly kids. It's a good example of what a stupid, violent, juvenile movie can be if you don't keep the story out of the kids' heads. I don't know why this movie never made it to television. If it had, it probably would have had some kind of redeeming value, and could still stand among the classics like Dr. Strangelove or Top Gun, but it would have been a little too "Saturday afternoon" for my taste. Recommended for: people who hate films and children. (And people who enjoy a good story.)
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The thing is to make a movie about a thing: the big, bad bull of a film industry, with all the pomp, circumstance and bluster that implies. The first three acts are great, but the last third is a letdown. A lot is made of the story of the bull, but really it doesn't have much going for it. It is an unpretentious movie with great actors and a superb music score. However, it does take its story from the works of William Faulkner in some of the scenes. I've never understood the fascination some people have with bullfights: they are ugly, unspectacular and utterly without value. There are no characters here, nothing to care about, nothing at stake. There is only a lot of talk and shouting. If you want a good bullfight, skip it. But if you are in the mood for something more dramatic than that, watch this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (I was not a huge fan of the film. I had only seen it once before (a year or so back, at a film festival), so the second viewing, at my aunt's house, was the first I'd heard about it.   There was one thing about the movie that was so annoying: the director (William Friedkin) made it seem as though the whole movie took place in a single house, and that we were going through a house of memories, but in the end we saw very little that had to do with the house.  So I guess the whole thing was a fantasy, and if you want a fantasy you can't go too far wrong with a French New Wave film.  A bad movie, perhaps, but a fantasy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had never heard of this movie before I watched it, but my friend had been talking about it for the longest time and finally decided to go see it (which I was very happy about).    I've seen plenty of bad movies over the years, but when I started this movie, I couldn't stop laughing my ass off.   There are lots of bad people in this movie.  Some of them are worse than others, but they're all awful.    The only good thing I can say about it is that they use a lot of different animals. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To watch this movie is to realize that you're living in the future. Even in the 1960s, there are many movies that feature the futurity of technology. But nothing is like this one. The film features a young inventor, J. C. Dyer, who is trying to perfect a super-advanced vehicle that he built to take his kids to and from school in the morning. However, a bad accident occurs and J.C. is severely injured. Not only that, but his daughter, Tanya Dyer (played by the great Frances Foster), is seriously injured and has to be treated in a hospital in New York. The hospital is run by Dr. J. O'Neill (played wonderfully by the late William H. Macy) and Jules O'Neil (played superbly by the amazing George Kennedy). Dr. O'sNeill is the first person that J.O. ever met but has come to be regarded as a very good doctor. Dr.J.O.'s only real crime is that he was caught with his foot in his mouth, but he is still regarded as an excellent doctor. Tanya, on the other hand, is one of his patients. Jules tells J.J that Dr.O'Neill is treating Tanya for a cancer and that she must leave immediately. When J.I. learns of J.G.D. and his wife being hospitalized, he asks Dr.Carpenter (played to perfection by the incomparable Peter Falk) if it might be possible for them to get a ticket and visit the Dyers in their hospital room. He tells him that he can arrange a transfer and the two families are allowed to go together. As the doctor leaves, J..C. tells Jules about the bad accident that left him hospitalized. He says that it was an accident and to tell the truth, I'm not sure it was a real accident but I think the two of them may be going to be quite a couple. This movie is a little bit like a cross between a science fiction movie and a romance movie. However the science in the movie is presented so well that I'm wondering if it's not something that the future will allow. As far as the romance is concerned, I couldn't imagine a better couple. I really felt sorry for J.Dyear and I loved that he had been hit so badly and the Dyer's had to put him up in their hotel. Of course,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is one of the few that has had a lasting impact on me. It has always been one of my favorite films to watch, and as a kid I remember watching it on VHS a few times. I had so many questions. Like, how does a kid be born so big? And, how did the people find him in the middle of nowhere? Then, I watched it again recently and it still amazes me! It may have been the first time I ever had sex in my pants. When I saw it at the movies I asked my friend, "Did you watch that?" She said she did, but it wasn't that much fun! But even now I love the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the greats of the 80s, and I would have a few of them to hand for the next few days.   As I have written previously, the original Superman film was the last great of the sixties, and was so far ahead of its time that there is probably not a child alive today who hasn't seen it and said to himself, "That is what grown-ups do when they can't use their superpowers, you know."   There is a certain amount of humor in the film, but it is the kind of humor that one has only experienced from watching old VHS recordings of this particular version.  There were so many new, innovative, and entertaining ideas present here that it was easy to get into.  It's a rare thing that one of the first movies ever to feature Superman does not contain the one thing that most fans feel is the defining thing about Superman: his lack of superpowers. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't mean to be melodramatic or to insult those who are really into this. But it's hard to explain this movie in one line. It's an old movie made in the '30's, set in the country where people didn't know that women were even allowed to leave the house! The whole thing is set in a house with all the old man's possessions. It looks like a barn or a house. There are a lot of rooms with different colors. It has a wooden roof, but the wind gets into the doors and the rooms and the roof... Anyway, a girl is brought up by her uncle (who is a sort of a old wise man, who thinks everyone needs to be careful, especially if they have children or are old) and he tries to teach her all the things that he knows. When she gets to the age to get married she is told to meet an old man, a wise man in fact, who will teach her how to be a good wife and wifelike woman. Well, in the first scene he teaches her some bad jokes... It seems that she is still learning. In the second, he starts to teach a woman about the proper way to behave in a marriage. Well... He begins with some very rude remarks. Then he puts down some clothes that she wears. He tells her that if she wants to dress up she must put on the wrong things. When he starts dressing her up, he tells her to put on her stockings, her stockinged feet and her stockade. In fact, she has to do it in reverse. Now I'm not trying to be negative and say this is bad, but it doesn't seem like it was well made and it doesn?t have any dignity to it. However I have seen a better movie, which is called THE BIG BANG THEORY.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first twenty minutes of The Mummy are all about the character's first interaction with a mummy. The first scene plays like a classic horror story and it is one that is pretty great. The idea of this mummy is an interesting one and I like how Dr. Carver sets the scene before his encounter. He knows of the creature in the tomb but doesn't really know much of what it is and he doesn't know exactly how old the mummy was. In terms of the monsters he encounters I think this is the best one yet. It's all pretty spooky and the creature was clearly made out of bones when Carver found it. It has a certain type of eerie power that is a good sign because it fits with the character of Carver. There is a scene where he discovers what seems to be a mummy that has just been decapitated by a sword. He is obviously very unnerved by what he sees and he is clearly frightened when the creature appears to have a mind of its own. The movie doesn't leave a lot of time to linger on this mummy. It is not given much time to grow or develop and it leaves us very little time to think about what has just happened. That is why I like the idea that this mummy was created from a mummy of the dead. It gives the movie a little bit more mystery and mystery makes it feel more like a scary movie than a campy one.  It is a very good movie and I wish more people would take the time to find a copy of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is very simple: a young boy who is very curious about the world around him joins a travelling carnival. He gets along well with a tiger named Tigris and a bear named Tundu. The rest of the cast is also pretty good. There's a scene near the beginning where a tiger gets hit by a car. The driver seems pretty upset about it so the tigers decide to cheer him up. Unfortunately, they are killed by a stray bullet after Tunduu leaves the fight.   There are some interesting ideas: a group of hunters and the boy are looking to kill an animal they call a "giant". A man has been going out and fighting monsters. They also look for a giant at the edge of the world who is apparently being held prisoner by the evil empire. The villain of the story is not very well developed. He comes across as an evil old man who can't seem to keep a good grudge. The movie doesn't have much action, but that's probably because the plot is pretty straightforward.   the movie, despite its simplistic plot, is very entertaining. There are some pretty good fight scenes with very little CGI and it's really nice to see a young man like Tigris with an actual animal. In terms of humor, the movie is pretty tame, but there are some fun bits with tigers and bad guys.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first time I watched this film was back in the day, at the end of my college years. I had never seen a romantic comedy before so it was a real treat watching one with my then-boyfriend, and now-husband. The film has some very good character development and the story line is pretty interesting.   There have been many "tombstones" in my life, including a father who died before his child had matured. This film, and the movie it was based on, are an important part of my childhood.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have watched this movie a dozen times now in all the versions, but this last one has the best soundtrack, the best cast, and the funniest characters. I also like the setting of the film because of the high-school setting, and that it has a different plot point in the second half. I have seen this movie on many occasions, and it is still entertaining and I like how it has different storylines in the last half. If you like good movies with well-written characters who fight and fall into some interesting situations, then this is one for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's nice to see a movie about a high school student with a love of food, especially Japanese food, so much so that they named their restaurant after her. I wasn't a huge fan of the original character design, and I was a huge foodie in my youth, so this movie doesn't hold a candle to the original movie I watched when I was growing up. I mean, we all knew this girl from our parents, and her name was Chiffon. So, not the best of movies but not a bad one either.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is based on a true story: a Canadian police force came to Brazil and, through a strange series of circumstances, rescued two American servicemen, who had taken refuge in a prison, from a lynch mob. The next morning, two officers were waiting outside when they realized the two men were dead. One officer went to the local police station and the other to the US embassy, where he found out that the two Americans were dead and in jail. They were charged with murder by the police because, according to the police, they tried to take revenge on a local man who had beat one of them. After the police showed their credentials, one of the men was released by the American diplomats. It was a little confusing, since one of those American soldiers was named Clark, but that was all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While this movie was a fun flick, I found it a bit boring. The movie was too long. Too bad it was just a bunch of people sitting around. What is the point of this movie if it's just a movie where a bunch people sit around and talk about things that no one really cares about or cares to talk about.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a smallish movie but very well made.   The plot is not exactly the best but it does keep us interested.  A lot of people criticize this movie but that's not bad. It's not a good story in general. But it's the fact that the film is about a man who is a hunter and a woman that gets him in trouble.  I don't know if you've seen the first film but there are a lot of similarities.  The best part of this movie is how good all the voice actors are.  It takes a few hours to get through the movie.  One of the highlights of this film is when we find out that our hunter got captured by some other hunter. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of horror movies, and one of my favorite genre is the slasher movies. I've been a horror movie fan since I was in the 7th grade, when I started watching the new TV show, "The X-Files" and I love the atmosphere of this movie. I can't believe that this movie wasn't made more of a masterpiece. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A young man named Michael gets an amazing job and a house in a lovely location. When it gets cold, he has an accident and dies. When his brother is killed, he blames it on the cold. A little later he is back and he can remember everything. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent movie, an action-packed action movie! I wish I had gotten a copy of it when it came out in 1992. The movie had all the elements of a great action movie, the characters, the suspense, the violence, etc. The only thing that made this movie a little bit less than great was that it didn't work as well as most other movies. I'm always going to mention it when I see it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is much going on in this movie but nothing of substance.   The story is about a man who is on a date with a girl whom he met at a bar when she comes out in a revealing dress, and he starts talking to her about his feelings for her.  The film is filled with clichés but no matter how many times the audience thinks "Well, that's not really true"    It is hard to watch because it is not real but it is the first movie ever to depict a real romance between a man and a woman who are not of the same race.  For most of the movie, they talk, laugh, eat and get drunk at a party but then there is a brief moment where the man and the woman stand alone in the parking lot and there is an awkward moment where he looks at the woman and she looks back at him and says "We have to see each other again soon"  If there were no "we" in this love story this movie would not have been as real or as romantic but it could have been written on the wall in neon red neon print that read "LOVE WILL BECOME THE ONLY WAY."   A review of a bad movie: This movie is not the first bad movie I have ever seen.  However, I believe that I have never seen a bad film that was even a shade worse than this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story of this movie starts out as a simple one, but is actually rather complex and has the potential to be very interesting, both as a thriller and a psychological thriller.   It starts off in the very typical way, that of an old man who moves into a small house with his wife and her sister. In a manner that will surely offend some people, he finds that both of his tenants are missing, along with one of the girls he slept with.    The older woman had recently moved in to the house to be closer to her son (who was only 6 at the time), so she was not home at the moment when the two other people had disappeared. It is also the case that the woman and the young boy (who had a penchant for breaking into other people's houses) had been spending some time in the nearby woods.  They found no trace of the boys, who apparently had run away some time before they disappeared.  The old man is, quite literally, not the first to come to the same conclusion that there may have been a murder in his area.  He had heard strange noises coming from the woods in the past and had also seen the two boys there once.  When the older woman moved into the house, the old man had taken up residence in the next room to his wife, so there was a bit of a bit about a half-hour gap when no one was ever heard from. After her disappearance, the woman had left the house one night in a terrible state, taking the boy with her.  She had stated she didn't remember where they were going, but she couldn't imagine how they got there since the woods were only about 30 miles from the house.  At that time, however, the house was abandoned with only the two things in the yard that were obviously left behind -- the clothes and the shoes of the young girl and the old woman, the boy who was playing in the woods with his toy truck.  It had been at about this point that the old couple had decided to look into the woods to see if there was anything more out there.  As the couple was driving around looking in the direction of the woods, the younger man suddenly spoke up.  This young man appeared to have been there all day and had a strange relationship with the old lady, whom he had met the first time that day.  His eyes, it is said, were blue and he had a voice so low that
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen this before. This is a pretty good movie. It was funny and dramatic at the same time. There are some great special effects and a good story in this movie. I recommend this movie to a whole new generation who are now older. I will definitely see this again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you say a movie has a 'happy ending', the film doesn't disappoint.  The music is a little cheesy, and the animation (well, the CGI) is terrible. But this movie has happy ending, which means it was probably worth watching just to look at. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was not a fan of "Jaws" for quite a few years, but "JAWS 2" restored my faith in Spielberg. The new movie does nothing but set up the original, but gives it new life in a way I haven't seen before. "Jawbreaker" might be Spielberg's most underrated movie and a film that Spielberg needs to make at least once a decade.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. There is some violence in it and there are things that we just can't imagine happening in our world. And the film's ending does seem to say that we're all in this together.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have nothing bad to say about this movie. The story is good, the plot is simple and there are good special effects. But, as a person who is fond of the classic horror movies of old, I found this movie to be very disappointing. And I had more fun with the old ones. I loved the movie as a kid, but after watching it, I have to give it 2 out of 3 stars. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is, in my opinion, one of the best horror films in the 70's. Not only is it a horror film, it has great gore effects and is full of eerie images and sounds. It is not scary in the traditional sense, but rather has an atmosphere that gives it a real creepy and spooky feel and really makes it one of my all time favorites. There are no obvious clues in the film to where the movie is going to go, but it is a good way to scare anyone. It really is one of those movies you can watch over and over and it gets better with each viewing. It's one of these films that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It won a lot of fans in the 80's, but I think the 80-90's saw its greatest popularity due to Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence and the many remakes and sequels. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has been so hard to get into! I'm not really sure I was really into the movie, it seems to be all about the fighting, there was no chemistry between the two lead actors. And then they spend two hours fighting with an exploding box, it made it kind of obvious, they were both fighting with a cardboard box. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't really feel like I was missing any points of the movie. It had great performances, a lot of humor, a good ending, and the action was pretty good.   This movie has a lot to offer, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the next one does. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this a couple of years back, as a student at an uni in rural New Zealand, and I was blown away with what this movie offered. A good example of a story-driven movie about a character who is living through life in the way that a person might when experiencing something traumatic.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a huge fan of Stephen King, and it appears that he is going to do something pretty crazy and fun with a classic horror movie for Halloween.  For those who haven't seen the movie, it involves a young girl who is being chased by a monster in the woods. She is saved by an old man who is armed with an axe.  This is a movie that really left an impression on me when I was a kid, and I think it is very appropriate for Halloween to be turned into a horror movie!  If you don't like Halloween or horror movies, don't watch this movie.  A few months ago I attended a horror-themed convention where my friend Dan (of "Spooky Tales" fame) and I learned about a couple of new films and a few old ones.  The new films were "Deadly Blessing", "The Witch", and "The Strain".  While I was impressed with the new films, I was very disappointed by the new horror anthology, "Dead of Night".   This is a wonderful film made in the 1930s by George Romero.    The movie begins in a small town in Ohio, where an old woman named Edith is taking a break from her farm in the middle of the day when she sees a young man in the fields.  She is not looking for a husband, and she doesn't get him.  In the next few minutes, a group of young boys try to lure Edith into a trap, and they succeed.  It is the beginning of a nightmare for Edith.    "Dead" ends with Edith being carried home through the woods by the same boy that tried to kill her.  I have to admit, I thought the ending of this movie was rather dark and disturbing, but I suppose I must be one of those people who can't stand horror films about children who are being hunted by monsters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What can I say about this that hasn't already been said?  A very good movie.  It has a very strong plot that has you wanting more, but this is still a good action movie with a strong cast.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have a bad habit of never watching the original Alien film, or its sequel. It's the only entry into the franchise that I don't think I'd watch, which isn't to say that I haven't at least heard about it or watched a few clips here and there. The Alien is one of my all time favorites and I think it's pretty easy to understand why. An alien who is an octopus-like creature who goes about abducting humans, killing them, and then eating them. He's the most horrible piece of human garbage ever created, and it's still one of the scariest films I've ever seen.    And that's the thing: this film is scary, but so is almost everything that Ridley Scott has ever done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first time I saw it, my head exploded. It was as if the movie came from a totally different universe to the movies I have seen so far (the usual) and the most outstanding of all, it was like a science fiction movie that didn't have to have a science. In this movie, all the bad guys were so bad, that even the good guys couldn't help but feel like bad guys.   This is such a weird movie, but it's so good. It makes me want to be a part of the world of science fiction and this time, all this weirdness was condensed into a movie that we could all be very much a part.  Just to let you know what this movie is about:  This story takes place after a meteor, the size of a small city, had crashed in a forest near the city (a city with a population of millions). The forest was completely burned out, but a few people managed to survive and, with help of the Forest People, they started to rebuild. The Forest People help people in need, like the Forest Woman, who has to help a couple of people she had a quarrel with. This movie is very different from most sci-fi movies that I've watched. In fact, it could be viewed as a parody of other Sci-Fi movies that are very very similar. The movie, however, is different from all other Sci Fi movies that we all know and love. This is the most bizarre movie I've ever seen. There is a lot going on in this movie. This was an unusual movie that was very original and very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not going to waste time to review this movie, since all I can say is that it is excellent. The story follows the story of a young man named "Boris" (I had to Google his name) who is living as an illegal homeless man in an apartment. He has been looking for a job in the last few years and has been told he would have to be homeless again in 3 years. This would not stop him if it weren't for a girl, named "Lisa" (another hilarious name). But Boris is a bit too ambitious and has plans to move back home and get an apartment to "make up for lost time". It is only when Lisa takes a job at a local bar that they start to become close. Soon Boris finds himself falling in love and falling in the love of his life, Lisa. This movie is hilarious. It is hilarious that a man as self centered as Boris would end up in love with a woman in the bar. It's also hilarious that he can fall in love to someone who is so ugly that he ends up buying a wig and going to the bar to meet her. The acting is top notch and the music is catchy. The movie is funny and a good romcom. I wouldn't give this movie up for the world. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be completely honest, it has some great lines that are funny and memorable and are made even funnier by the actor's accents (they were good enough to make me cringe). The acting is nothing special though; you can tell these people were cast primarily for the roles and not the role-play.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Best of Both Worlds" is a unique film; an absurd and entertaining science fiction film set entirely in the world of television!  It stars Robert Hays as an extremely successful television executive from the future who can no longer hide the fact that he's not only a womanizer; he is now a woman, an attractive, sophisticated, sophisticated woman, a kind of transgressive woman, one with a man's sensibilities and interests who, for reasons that still remain mysterious, has a rather odd relationship with a woman from her past who is now married to the President.  This film is very much of its time, and the science fiction of it all, but also very much its own time, with a very original plot with lots of humor and the kind of ideas that no one thought possible in a 1960s film! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you are not the most die hard of comic book fans, I'll make sure you are: This was a fun watch, which made me want to watch the rest of the series.  This is a fairly short running time.  The story is fast paced with good action and some awesome comic book/graphic novels from Marvel.  I especially enjoyed the ending that really made you feel good about the DC and Marvel universes:   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is not a story about a hero. It's an old story, told better, with more color, a wider variety of emotions and a greater sense of humor. If you want a romantic comedy and it's not sentimental, you're out of luck. If your a comedy fan with a soft spot for alliterative dialogues, you'll enjoy it. If not, well, you've got to give it a second watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really hoping this movie would be better than The Rock.   It didn't.   As bad as the movie is, the main part with Paul Walker is good.  I loved the song.  There were things about this movie that were very off-putting.  However, the final reveal (of how Walker died) is really quite good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never saw a bad B horror movie with this movie, it was funny, creepy and a good action movie. It starts with a very strange and sad guy (Mr. T) who's friend/relative/sister gets killed in an accident. His wife and daughter are there. Mr. T gets drunk and has an awful nightmare about a very pretty girl (Katherine Hepburn) who was killed in a car accident. After waking up in the hospital with a cold, he asks his doctor to help him get to sleep and then gets some help from his old friend and the best psychiatrist (George Bernard Shaw) to help deal with the nightmare. The story is about Mr. and Mrs. T, who get involved in a big drug deal by their friend the "Madam," played by "Mr. Dick" (Eddie Marsan). When they buy some cocaine from her, they find out about the deal that she had with her rival. The other rival (George C. Scott) doesn't like the way the Madam does it and tries to get rid of her. The Madam gets the idea to make Mr.T try to kill the rival. When the rival dies, it becomes an auction for the drugs. The guy who tries to kill Mr. C.Scott is the "Mummy" from another movie (and I've never seen this movie), and Mr. Dick, who is a real madman in this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A beautiful movie, beautifully directed by the late David Lynch. I loved the fact that the film, despite being a fairly conventional drama, was still full of mystery, suspense, and some terrific performances from the talented Lynch and his actors.  The film has a dark humor, dark atmosphere and very original characters (including a rather creepy guy with an obsession with Marilyn Monroe).  The movie has a couple of excellent bits about a boy who has been sent into the forest by his parents because his older brother has a crush on a girl.  At first, the boy is confused and confused, until he realizes that what he saw was indeed his mother (who lives just a few yards from where he is hiding), with the girl who has taken over his father's job.  I enjoyed this movie very much. I hope it is seen many times, it seems to have had a very long life as Lynch continues to make these movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this film, although I'm sure I will be very happy with something else next year.  I think that this is a great movie with excellent acting and a really wonderful script.  It doesn't take long to become a true fan.   I like to think that when I have more time, I will go back and watch the rest of this series to see if there is more to it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film itself wasn't as interesting as I had expected it to be. It's a thriller, and it's basically a "who can kill the biggest baddest bad guy" situation. I'm glad to have gotten it (and not just from the reviews I had read) and it seems that the film will continue to grow in my mind and I'm quite interested in seeing what else the filmmakers have up their sleeves. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a beautiful movie and an extremely well made film. The film is about one man, the first of his kind, the son of a famous writer named Sigmund Freud. He and his wife, Lila, have three daughters and live in a house with a view to the sea. They are separated as little children and grown ups who are not very nice to one another. Freud is often at odds with Sigmud and Lila (and their husband) and even Freud has a bad time getting the girls to sleep at night. Freud's daughter Gretel is not much better off - she is much shorter and prettier, which makes Freud's children quite jealous. Freud makes money by writing a series of books on the family, a popular series which is in danger of being forgotten by the author. Freud gets a new wife, a very pretty French girl called Lila who is in love with him and who is willing to be his girlfriend. Freud has to cope with his daughter Gretchen, who is constantly going off on her own and whose personality is erratic and unpredictable. The Freud family lives in the country and so their home is very different to the house of Sigmun Freud, a literary figure who was famous in Vienna in the late 19th Century.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film "The Man Who Fell From Grace" is a rather interesting film and an entertaining one at that.  The story is rather unusual, involving a man from Earth who has somehow managed to lose his sense of direction during his brief sojourn, who is now wandering around the planet in search of his missing wife, as well as the man who fell from grace. And then, to add to this, some rather amusing side characters emerge from the woodwork (some of them quite likable, others not).  It is really an entertaining film.  And with the wonderful music by Peter Lilliput and the beautiful and catchy melodies of Rolfe Winkler, it is hard to resist watching.   As for the characters, most are somewhat forgettable, with only one character in particular being memorable and being a more than adequate villain. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is true that at first the story seemed very strange, but as a well-prepared film, and with very good acting, it will do for at least a very rainy Saturday afternoon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best part of the movie is the dialogue between the two brothers. The two of them talk about how they grew up together and how they were always on the road together. The way they talked about each other was hilarious. The brother who used to be a professional actor who played a very funny comedian. He talks about how his real name was Bill and he has been working on a new one for years now. I'm not sure if it is funny or not. I guess some people may like it, but a lot of people may find it a little old hat.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie! It's a great action movie about a team of "ninjas" trying to retrieve a huge "mystery" from some nasty creatures that live in the sewers. The main characters have different backgrounds, but in the end they all get the same thing. Their main foe is an evil sewer king who lives in a large castle in the sea. One by one his army of snakes are killed one by one, but the final one keeps on coming. He's strong and tough. The other guys are weak but not impossible to take down. In the end we learn that the king's son was kidnapped and is kept hostage. The next scene shows the king flying off on his own in his plane to get revenge on the team.   The movie is very dark and the characters are very dark.  It's an interesting story with a lot of tension, but there are a lot more action movies out there. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not sure I can recommend more to a movie lover like myself, a guy who never felt the need to see a silent film but who has watched many in the past. In fact I didn't even see it until a few years ago and I'm still not sure why. I know that it is about a man who goes to the hospital to retrieve his sister who has a brain hemorrhage but who is a good-natured woman. When he arrives and the doctor says that she has the greatest case of hemorrhagic shock she will ever see she exclaims, "I have been looking forward to seeing this movie." It's one of those movies where a good script (or rather a brilliant director) has got it right. There is a reason why the director was awarded the Best Picture Oscar for it in 1929. It is very good-looking and there is the typical "old people dancing with their young grandchildren" routine without the usual amount of dancing around the campfire. When it all comes to its bitter end you're told how the old lady got her brain back without it getting crushed. If you only watched the movie as a spectator you would think that it was a bad movie about a bad girl. Then you see it, and it is really the opposite. The characters, the settings and even the people are well acted. It does have the usual slow build up with little characters getting into trouble and the main character, who has just lost his sister, going through some serious problems. As for the plot, it is a simple one about a "good girl" coming to her sister's aid. It doesn't really involve much but is all the better for it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Great movie  I didn't really expect much but a lot of good, nice effects and good acting made this movie great, the only bad part about the movie is when the old lady starts talking about her "lost husband" when in fact his name was "Bobby" and he was always trying to run away, he didn't have any kids so maybe it was all a dream, but I'm not sure  So, I watched this and it did not disappoint, the kids were really cool, but the bad part is how they try to pass off old people as new people, they should not be fooled, a good way to end a good day and a bad movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you only look at the synopsis of this movie you might think it's a "Star Wars" movie. I thought it was a pretty good movie. It took me a little while to get into it. It wasn't bad, it wasn't terrible. It was a movie about a group of kids trying to get to the local movie theater. It seems the kids' parents are gone on a camping trip. The parents are pretty relaxed, but there's the weird kid who thinks it's OK to be weird all the time. It's a movie of friendship that I found very touching.   It was a strange movie at first. It would not have surprised me if a bunch of kids made their way to the movie theater and walked out of the theater without a movie. But it wasn' t just that, the movie was very well acted. It also had a good soundtrack, which I found to be good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For the record, my movie review is not going to be about how brilliant the movie is but rather about how much I love it! There is a good reason for this: This movie is about the life of two men. They are both very different from each other. One a brilliant scientist who created some very beautiful robots and who, while he is brilliant, is very kind and considerate towards his children. The other a lonely young man who has no one and is so unhappy, he cannot think or enjoy anything. Their lives are so different that they cannot be more different. But that is what makes them so unique and so important: They are also a symbol for the entire human race, who in their own way have been made by the hands of God to make the world a better place to live in. The story is about a man who does not understand his own father and who sees his son as a failure and, to make matters worse, a traitor to his country. His mother is very proud of him and has always made sure he is well looked after. When he gets the idea to become a scientist for his own personal gain, he finds out that his mother has a very strange relationship with her son. The movie is very moving because, like so many films about human nature, it touches a nerve. We watch these two men and wonder how each of them came to be so different and what fate brought them together in this strange and sad world. The way this film is shot is amazing. It is beautifully shot from every angle and the story comes alive so easily. I wish I could see more of it. The ending is extremely satisfying. If you like film you'll probably love this. This is a movie about the nature of man and about what is to be done with the world. If nothing else, you will have a wonderful time. I give it a 8/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like the original Ghostbusters (the original 1984 film, which is, I think, not the best film by any means, but a good one) and you're a fan of the original Ecto-1 and I-10 (the I-100 is about the best ever, but still not quite up to the original, but you have to see it) and/or you were a kid in the 80s or 90s and you grew up with the original movie and the other episodes, then The Real Ghostbusters is a great way to enjoy a bit of nostalgia. It's set in the late 80s, when we were all getting more techy than the kids these days (the early episodes are really cheesy, but not so cheesy that the plot takes a turn), and has an older than usual cast of characters including the three Ectos. It makes no apologies for its cheesy tone, but it's also kind of funny (not cheesy, funny). A lot of kids' movies feature aliens that look like monsters, but the Ghostbusters are not aliens. They look like humans with monster heads or with a ghost behind them. The Ectomobile and Ectopist are a little more ridiculous, but this is still a goofy movie, one of those that have a couple of laughs and no one cares if it ever goes over 40 minutes. The action scenes are just ridiculous, including the classic scene where the Ghostbusters try to trap a demon by turning the engine over on its side and trying to ride it upside-down. All this would be a problem if it were just kids' movie, but The Real Ghostbustin's is more mature and it also has a strong female lead. This one has some great action scenes too, and lots of gags and jokes, but most of the humor comes from the characters, and they aren't even all that funny. It would be great if they made more films like this, the Ghostbusters, I-50 and I'm not even kidding.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In what may be the most interesting twist in recent memory, the new movie "American Gods" has left us with yet another question to ponder: Did the gods from the ancient world in the form of the old "Dirty Harry" films really exist? Well, it's not very difficult to believe that they did.  There's a lot of talk about "The Book of the Dead," the book which supposedly contains the entire knowledge of the gods and which, if it really existed (and I for one, could not find anything that contradicts this fact), would mean that the gods have a huge following of people who believe in the myths and believe in them with all of their hearts, minds and souls.    The movie "The Dukes of Hazzard" is no doubt influenced by the Bible, so that may have helped.  Also of note is the way in which the character of Apollo, the messenger of the Gods (I'm assuming they actually exist, if I'm not mistaken), is handled.  He uses a cane and is never seen in the action, but we are shown a lot about how he talks, and he does have a big belly - and his face is covered with a lot, I'm told.  But what is even more interesting are the ways in which he talks and what he says: "What a man would not be," said Apollo, "Who would not do what I do."  I'm sure we know who this man is, but he goes on to say that in fact he would rather do what the gods do:  "The thing I like the best," said the god Apollo,  "is giving orders.  You take the order from me - that makes me happy.  A bad thing would be not to do what you order me to do.  What I like most, is to be ordered.  I wouldn't want it otherwise.  The only thing I'm afraid of is when someone tells me to get a grip.  "   I guess that last statement is a pretty good summary of the entire movie.  Maybe that's how the gods would like it?   It seems that they want to keep you from getting the grip - but it seems that a lot more is needed than just a good grip.   The Dukes take the action to the streets of New York, but once you get there, you can't help but notice that they have a lot to learn from the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I saw this movie a few years ago I thought "I would never be disappointed by this." A very good movie. It has all the elements to a great movie. I was surprised to read some of the reviews where it is called a comedy. I thought it was a really good movie with great performances. I think the best part is the ending. The whole movie has good acting but not too many scenes. It is a fun movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'd seen the first version of this film in theaters, and was surprised that I liked it so much. I was especially surprised to find it so funny and inventive, because of the way it so deliberately and ingeniously distorts reality to a hilarious extent. I loved it so very much!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is simple and it is told with a nice and light hand. It's also the only one on this list that is based on a comic book. The movie stars the good looking Kevin James with his hair and eyes in the right place.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been meaning to write a review about the new movie, The Best of Enemies, for sometime now. And I didn't hate it, but I'm not a big fan. I like good movies and this is just a good one.   The story is pretty simple, but it takes advantage of the fact that it is set in an office setting and utilizes the premise of "who's in charge" to great effect.     It is well acted by a great cast of actors, but the acting seems to be a little forced, if that makes sense. For example, it seems that in the beginning of the film, the characters talk about how the film will have a big budget, and you're supposed to think, well, that is probably because there is a lot of money involved. Well, no, it doesn't actually have a budget, the entire movie is made up of a small team of people, two cameramen, and a crew of two, so there wasn't a lot to spend on the movie.  The cast is great, the movie is well shot, the plot is simple and the actors are all great (especially the women).   I give it a 2.       And yes, I'm biased because I like Michael Douglas, but this movie does have a flaw. The movie plays it too safe. It plays out the "who does it better" battle, and it is a good fight, it is definitely a well put together film, but when it gets to the ending I got a little bored. There is a very easy fix though, there is some awesome action scenes that I really like, and I do like those sequences so I would like to see it continue. But this is a fun and simple action movie. If you haven't seen it before, then I would definitely recommend this movie, I've never seen a good office movie, so I'm pretty sure there is no reason why it should not have been amazing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm sorry the movie isn't better, it could be, but the script by Peter Farrelly is so good that it's hard to believe that a new film could ever match it.    If your a fan of the Farrelly's, you won't be disappointed, you may even get a chance to meet him in person. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For years I have avoided movies like this. It has a really silly premise, a girl's attempt to become a pirate. As a first movie I thought it would be silly, but then it got more serious and then I thought, "Well, I guess it must be good if the pirates love it." Now that I look back the first thing I said is, "Why didn't you add a swordfight scene?" The rest of the movie is a fun adventure. If you are going to make a film about a girl who decides to become an escaped prisoner, you would think you would do a good job at it. What I like about it is that the story takes a little too much time to wrap up. However, a pirate movie should be fun and well directed and this movie does both.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like good stories, good characters, and a good plot, get ready for a ride that will take you from the comfort of your own home to the very edge of outer space.  As I said before, it's a very special movie in that the film is set in the fictional city of Kanto, a place that you can only visit in the anime version. We have the classic story of a young boy named Keaton (Hiroshima Kanemoto) who works at a shop called "Lemonade" which specializes in the sale of lemonade and other confections. Keaton also happens to be a boy who is afraid of anything new, except maybe an adventure.  (I won't give anything away. If you haven't seen the anime, please don't read anything below about it!)   A few weeks into the work week, Keaton gets a package delivered to him with a letter inside, notifying him of the death of his stepmother who had passed away at an early age. Keato is heartbroken, and since he loves nothing more than lemonade, he thinks that it is time to travel. The package is addressed to an old friend of Keato, a beautiful girl named Milla. And Keato realizes that since there is only one thing he is good at, it is lemonade. So the two boys set out in search of the first person that will let them travel into outer space!   The story is a classic one. As one of the characters is to do and a story will be told by a person that is said to be from outer space; the story is told in the form of a short story which is presented in a very brief and descriptive way. The best thing about this story is that it makes use of Keaton's fear of aliens and monsters and his love for a simple, but nice sweet lemonade that he eats every day. But the best thing of all is that a few years later, the story comes back to haunt Keaton in many different ways. Keatus is also the person who will become the best friend that we have and also the first to go on an adventure to the far world.   I should also mention that this is the second film that is based off of the original manga which is by Masami Kurumada. And I must say that the manga did not disappoint. In fact, I am still amazed at some of the scenes that

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a must see. One thing I'm not a huge fan of is the whole character development thing, but that's just me. There's a great ending where they have to leave their old home and leave behind their old lives. But the main character makes a point to tell everyone he met at the old house he'll never come back. I think it's a powerful message, and I hope someday there's a sequel that explores the character's personal life and the way he deals with those around him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is, in my opinion, the most underrated of all the Star Wars films and the best Star Wars film ever made in my humble opinion.  I didn't know much about the movies or the franchise but I liked it well enough that I decided to see it. The opening credits made me grin like a hyena.  The opening crawl did the same.  We were in space with space ships flying by.  They looked great but this was no space opera.  It is more like the most beautiful space opera movie ever made with the space vehicles taking the place of modern buildings.  Then they showed us the story... The movie doesn't go out of its way to explain the background but it does explain some things about the heroes in the first act and it seems that these heroes are being trained by a race of tall, white-haired creatures called "Gwendians" ( I am sure they don't have a human name). This is followed by the story of a small blue-skinned creature that is a Jedi and a thief (or a Jedi who was a thief) named Qui Gon ( this was one of those movie in which you don't know what you are in for until it has already happened).  The characters are quite well written except for a few. Qui is played by one of the most famous stars of the movie, George Lucas.  His acting is amazing as are all the other acting in this movie.  George Lucas also played Obi Wan Kenobi and was very good in the role.  Qui's love interest is the movie's villain.  This villain is portrayed by Robert Duvall ( the most talented actor in the movie) with an amazing performance. I don't remember Duv all that well but I have seen many films by this actor and his performance is amazing.  As to the villains, there are three.  First is a man (I have trouble finding a name for him) who has his face and hair shaved and wears a long trench coat and the villain has his arms and legs cut off and is now called "Waddu," the name I just made up.  He is a coward who has a weakness to red pepper (I think they mean chili pepper) and the leader of this group is a human woman who looks like the movie version of Carrie Underwood.  These women will be very attractive to men.  There are also a couple of men who look very much like Star Wars fans
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When it comes to sci-fi and horror, I have not seen many movies that could beat The Cabin in the Woods for being pure camp. The acting, however, is what kills it. I really enjoyed the movie from start to finish. I am just so happy that the movie is about to be released on DVD, and that it will be out on VOD soon! I guess there is no such thing as too much horror.  "The Cabin in a Woods" can only be seen in theaters in New England on September 21.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are two reasons why I'm glad we've had two years to sit and watch a great movie, and I've seen all kinds: classic classics, modern blockbusters, "fantasy", "romantic"... and even a "horror" film.   For one thing,  The Wizard of Oz  is a pretty old film, released in 1937.  It tells the story of a boy who's going to a fantastic world called Oz.  The world has a wicked witch (Mamma Dorothy) who's always trying to get her hands on the Tin Man (Jack) who will bring her some treasure. The kid discovers the Tin Men (and a flying horse named Dashiell and a mysterious woman, Glinda) and learns that he can do some things that no one else can.  To get back home, the kid learns to build a box (with his own hands) with a hole at the bottom.  Then the boy discovers that it's a box of magic and can take him to places that he's never been before.  What's so great about this film?  Well for one thing that Dorothy, the witch, is a terrific actress, and  it's her first major role in a film. Her hair is curly like a ponytail, and her eyes sparkle like diamonds.  So what's all the fuss about?  One might say it's just another "toy film," but The Wizard actually stands out, for there is something very "magical" about this movie.  Sure, it's "Disney" -- and they had a great deal of success, even among children.  Yet The Wizard is so much more than that, for it is also a very touching movie about what it really means to be a child, and what it is to grow up.  And it's about the best film ever made about an imaginary adventure for a real-life kid. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As my friend is fond of reminding me, The Good Earth was a pretty straightforward horror film. A woman (Laura Dern) finds her son and her husband on a vacation to a beach house run by a strange family. The husband and the children are dead, and it's up to Laura to find out who does it. A pretty straightforward plot. The film is a bit short, and not very pretty. The acting is pretty forgettable. Laura Dern is pretty bad at it.  Posted by David J. Smith at 3:57 AM

This film was made in the late sixties.  A story about a girl who is sent into the woods, but doesn't come back.  I enjoyed the film.  The only thing I didn?t enjoy was the acting. It is really bad!   Also, the characters are a little boring.

He drives back to his home in the country and finds that all his family has left him. His wife has been shot and her son has been killed. Now, he must drive his family across the border to safety - at the cost of their lives.  He does so in a little car and drives as fast as he can - at a loss. His son, who has just begun to play cricket, is killed while trying to take a catch - the next day he is cremated in a ritual that is meant to bring back their lives to life, but has instead brought their deaths back to life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't tell you how happy I am to have made a movie! I got the feeling there was a little bit of magic at this movie, because I just loved the story. I'm not much of a film maker, and I didn't really think this movie would do much, but it ended up doing more than just entertaining. I think if a director like R.J. Cutler made a sequel, it could be great. I was so inspired by the idea of how beautiful the world is, and how much of it could just vanish into thin air. It was just so incredible to see the human race going so crazy, but in the end we realize that the magic isn't all that it seems, and that the earth is really just as beautiful and fragile as it looks. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So far so good. It's not a bad movie, at all. I just didn't enjoy it. In fact, it wasn't very good at all, the kind of bad movie that just doesn't leave me satisfied at all: I'm not sure I can tell if it had a good cast or bad cast, but it wasn  It was good that the movie did its job. No, they were not actors from other movies, though their roles were quite similar to the actors from those movies. They really could not have been more different, actually, though, I guess, their roles might be similar enough, and they were doing what is expected of them. Not so much of it was new to me, as it's probably not something that can be said of nearly all Western-made movies, where the heroes have to face a lot of tough, scary, and even scary evil people.   There was also some of the old bad Western-type tropes: there were some good performances by the actors, there was a good story, and there were decent and interesting characters. It might not have had quite enough of the "wow" factor in it to make me go out and see a few more Western-style movies. For that, a better movie would have had to have been made. And then it would have been interesting, because I could have seen how they did a better job than they were able to do. But a good Western movie is not a good western movie because its good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you see a movie, a story unfolds from memory. It's the way stories are. And, as it turns out, this story begins with a man, named William S. Hartwell (played by Cary Grant), who is a small town country boy, that ends up making a big splash on the national scene. He starts out as a country bumpkin, who moves to Manhattan and works as a bartender, then ends up as a world-famous movie star, who is about to open his own movie studio! William has all the glamour, charm, and personality of a movie star. The movie, "Million Dollar Baby," is the first of many times that Mr. Hart, played by Cary, will be a prominent part in a film. There's a lot of singing and dancing, but mostly it's dialogue and the characters are portrayed as being really good actors. I've always been a fan of Cary Grant, and I loved seeing Mr. Grant playing the role of the big-hearted country bumpkins he has always been, and this movie is his most entertaining work to date. He has a lot to work with because the film is set mostly in the old, rustic scenes of the American midwest. And he gives it a real old-time Western look. I think that this is one of his better efforts, and if you liked "The Outlaw Josey Wales" and "The Magnificent Ambersons," you will love this movie. I'm a big fan of The Country Boys, and, I think, this is the best movie made about the movie cowboy, to date!

He had a great performance, which has been well-received all over the world.   I'd never heard of Gary Cole before I read this book. When I bought the audiobook, I decided that I would have to buy the book and listen to it.  I got the first book from my local library, a collection of stories from the 19th century.  They were well worth buying if you're a movie buff.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The ending to This Is Spinal Tap was the ultimate example of what film-makers should not do:  it is ridiculous to think that the band are going to be back in the studio to record the next album in time for the festival, and so the film-maker makes a big deal out of it, only to be proved right by a rather inept set-up (in fact, it would have been even better if the band hadn't turned up at the gig, which meant that they weren't going to even bother to have a decent set:    "The Spinal Tapping of the Century!").   It was great fun in a stupid but funny style, as if the film had been made in the early 60s.   This is a shame as it was actually pretty good.

However, I would have liked it better if the kid had not done things like "turn off the lights and then run away" when they were playing hide and seek.   The film is well done, very well done; however, I feel that the filmmakers have wasted their talents and talent for the next film with it being a bit short at only 3 minutes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good looking movie that's well made. It features a lot of real comedy, action and romance in its mix. I didn't expect to be in love, but I was. A lot of love goes into this movie, as this is a love letter to film noir. It's set in an old school building and there are some pretty interesting things going on within. The actors are superb and it is a real treat to watch. The movie starts with the main character, Sam (played by Johnny Lee Miller) walking out to the subway after a night of drinking. He spots a pretty girl sitting on the subway and he can't help but stare. He then asks to sit next to her and he is struck by her beauty. As we all know, these two characters get into a relationship and then Sam is shot and killed. The girl is called Ruby (played with great chemistry by Pamela Reed) and her life is never the same. The other girls in her class are very jealous and they are able to do little to stop this couple. There is a murder here and Ruby is very much involved. This is one of the best romantic movies I've seen in a while. I would suggest it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery or just a good time. Recommended.

This is why I like the old-fashioned old-man crime film so much, even though it never makes sense to me why they would choose a character like this to do the heavy lifting. It's kind of like the bad guy in an old Western: if you don't have any gun (in this case, two guns, one of which is a submachine gun), then you might as well leave.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never really liked superhero movies. I don't understand them, I find their action silly and I find some of them really hard to follow (especially the "I'm so strong that I could break a building with my head!" moment in the first one). That doesn't keep me from liking this movie, especially when it's a good one. For a long time I thought there was no way Marvel would make a movie about the X-Men. That seems crazy now. One of the things I like about these movies is that they don't have big fights or anything, although the X Men do show up a few times. They just keep making X-men movies, and they keep making better ones. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of  how the Nostalgia Killer  is born is the classic tale of a genius who was born in the wrong time and the wrong place (I am talking about this movie: "The Nostalgia Killer" from 1983). In fact, he died for real in 1984 in a car crash in California. But you will never meet the genius (unless you are one of those obsessed people who read all the books he wrote and watch all the movies he starred in: like myself) and he died like a genius, leaving all his belongings in his daughter's bedroom. The daughter (I mean the daughter) lived with her grandmother (the same woman who gave her birth) in a house surrounded by all the things that her father loved. The only thing that is missing is her mother. As the story goes, one day the daughter was in the bathroom, and she suddenly heard her grandmother saying: "Mama, look at your eyes! You are really lucky to have eyes so beautiful!" It was only a small voice but she said: "Grandmother, it's impossible! There is no mother." So she asked her grandma: "But why is it impossible? Who is your mother? Did she die?" The grandmother answered: "No, she is still alive. She just needs to be fed and clothed." In order to get the girl to believe, the grandmother took her to the garage where she discovered that the woman in the bedroom was a doll. That was all. The whole story sounded so ridiculous, that the daughter kept crying. After that, she couldn't cry anymore and so she went outside. When she got outside the daughter saw her grandmother lying in the garden. The grandmother was in her thirties (and looked it too) and she had a large scar on her stomach and her cheeks were swollen. But the daughter found a necklace in the grandma's pocket: "This is the one that my mother wore when she died. If you will return it to her, she will die." As she left, the daughter realized that she could bring the grandma back. And here is where it got really weird: the daughter went back home and left the necklace in her grandparents' bedroom. One day she returned to take it back. After looking at the necklace for a while she found a page in which was written a poem. And it read: "She will be back again soon, and will return a whole new woman to you! Do you
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this so much more than the other "Shrek" films: that is, the other movies that Disney made after it. I loved "Shreks" so much I felt I had seen every single Shrek movie...even the ones where he had an evil twin. It's a good film...even if it does have a few problems. The best, though, is that at least the actors who portray the Shreks are very good.  I like this movie, despite a few flaws. This is a funny, but silly, adventure. The music by Richard Williams is great. I wish they made more. I think the film was made after the "Prince Charming" series of films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To the people who are still saying "The Devil's Advocate" is a classic: No it is not. It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's the kind of movie you watch when you're bored, don't care much about a story, like the movie it tries to tell, and there's nothing wrong with a bad movie. If I saw it at a crappy movie theater, I'd still see it. It had some of the best acting I've seen in a movie in years. It did, in fact, do a pretty good job of taking a simple story and making it into something even more silly than it already was. The film is so ridiculous I have to wonder if the people behind it have any intention of being funny at all. It was the most poorly directed movie I've heard of in quite a while. It didn't even have good acting, I guess they could have found an actor with a better nose. But they didn't, and that's a good thing. It does, however, have one good scene. It would be a good film if they'd made something with a good premise and good acting. This is what they had: a guy who is always in trouble with the cops, who gets caught by the cops because he's always in a hurry, who tries to get back at the cops by trying to kill them, and the cops always catch him, of course, but the guy always gets away. And this is why, he says, he goes around with a little machete to cut the necks of the cops. Why did he make this film, why is he making a movie, why does he need to do this to everyone, especially to the girls? And he has this movie come out the first weekend of May for people to see. He has to get a bunch of celebrities in this movie because he wants them to be in his next film. This movie does a pretty bad job at trying to be funny. If you are expecting to laugh at something like this, you won't. It seems like a terrible idea to make a movie about a guy with a knife and a macheto who's constantly in trouble at work, who lives in a house that he wants to burn down, who kills people out of anger and has a moustache. It takes a whole hour before anyone realizes "Okay, this is a bad idea." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is not very funny, but in an important way it is more "real". It is just a movie about a guy who likes to be "in" the music. His only friend is "the guy in the band", who is a bit of a dandy but still has a great sense of humor and makes the movie more "funny" than is probably necessary to make the movie interesting. A good soundtrack makes the whole thing worthwhile.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Dictator  is a masterpiece.    It is also a very powerful satire of a regime that has become a complete joke.  This is a film that should be seen by anyone who does not want to take a joke. - January 15, 2010The Greats
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For a movie that was not about baseball, there was an awful lot of baseball going on. The story of Babe Ruth and Jesse Owens was the backdrop, but it was the exploits of Bill Mazeroski and Harry Roque that really made the film. Mazero s made Mazerovskia for himself with his bat and his swing. In a movie full of great action sequences, this was one of the most memorable. A great film about a great player!  Review by George H. Young of Los Angeles. A brilliant film about baseball and its place in society. Mazi and Roque are great actors. Mizer has a real emotional presence and Roge is a masterful actor. I watched this film in the cinema a year after it was filmed. It is very powerful and one of those times when one has to sit down and think about the events that are happening around them. One could see the effects of war and social problems in America at the time. It made my mind very uneasy and I was surprised by the amount of blood and violence that took place. The film was shot in black and white by the legendary Howard Hawks. There are scenes that are very difficult to watch.  Film noir is as much the genre of baseball as any other popular movie genre. The movie was also a bit of a throwback to the "golden age" of movie noir - the early 1930's. For the best of baseball films, one must also examine the other aspects of the movie: the movie star, Mazerowski and his "tour de force" of a performance; the baseball stars who make up the best baseball teams; the political and military politics that surround the sport; the various characters who occupy the baseball world. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the best "movie" I've seen on the big screen. If you watch this movie without having watched the TV or seen the trailers beforehand, then you are missing out on an exciting and entertaining adventure! As with all good stories it starts off slow, but then it's over in no time! This is a very good "movie", if you like a movie with a lot of action and adventure. I really liked this movie, it gave me a good sense of the world and the characters, I really enjoyed all the action and the scenes with the monsters and the giant robots. If this movie is a "movie for kids" then I think that I found it to be pretty good too!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is good. It might be the greatest sci-fi film ever made, even better than 2001: A Space Odyssey. But let me go back to 2001: I am not sure if it was the best movie ever made. In fact, I would say it was at best average. The story of a space ship coming back to Earth is quite good (not the sort of film that you want to see on your birthday). There are many ideas in this film (which were quite obvious a long time ago) and the performances all do justice to the material and give the film a feeling of verisimilitude. That said, this movie will probably rank with the greatest films of all time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a huge fan of the Twilight films.  There are so many great scenes and such a great cast.   I always say that if this were a musical, I would have bought it.  And I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves romantic comedies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is what you might call a low-budget film, but the result is a terrific movie.   It stars James Garner as a high school student in a suburb that has been devastated by a horrible tragedy and there's nothing there but grief and suffering.  The movie follows Garner's character through the various stages of grief, as he finds out the extent of what his life has been about for the last 15 years.  When a high ranking police officer, played by Dick Powell, tells him that there's someone else involved in the death of his friend (played by Bill Murray) it hits him hard.  A police psychologist (Philip Seymour Hoffman), also played by Powell, is dispatched to help him to find out if there's anything he can do to make it all go away.    It's an odd movie because it seems to have been shot and edited with a single thought in mind.  It is a small movie, but it has a great sense of place and a sense of what sort of a kid would want to see that sort of movie - something that would help him get through the tough times of high school.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have always loved this movie. It is about a boy, named Joe, who is about the oldest kid in town. He plays the guitar, sings and sings and then some more when it is in the summer. I really like him! He does not talk much, but his music is great.  I like the scenes where he sings. He has a great voice and can carry a movie.  The ending is really good and I hope there will be a sequel, as I would like to see this boy again.

Reviewer: Mr. Kincaid - favorite favorite favorite - June 22, 2005  Subject: Just OK... I guess The Man with the Golden Arm is an enjoyable movie (especially if you're into WWII and/or the Second World War). The acting is good, and the film is entertaining. It's not anything to get excited about, but it's not bad either. And it does have a nice ending with a nice cliffhanger ending. The film does not have a bad track record, and it's a good one as well. But I'd be wary of making a movie of it - unless you're a sucker for WWII and WWII movies. - June 20, 2005Just OK...  Review:
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For people who want to see a good film they should check out the movie "Fahrenheit 451" the movie that will make any person who watches it feel good about themselves. When I was a kid growing up in the 50's I never could understand why people would make fun of a book written by a man named Ray Bradbury (who died about 20 years before I was born). It seemed to me that they wanted to make fun not just of a piece of entertainment but of an entire way of life. It was as if they wanted everyone to look down at themselves so they could be superior to the rest of us and everyone else. Well now I am old enough to understand the reason why so many people laughed at the book because it was about a time when that was all that really mattered and it was a way of living. This movie teaches you why there is a future in entertainment. It teaches you how to read with pleasure. It shows you what good writing can do. It is not a perfect movie by any means, but it is good. It gives a good laugh and is also very interesting. The way people in the future are depicted is so realistic that you can almost see the present! I can not wait until my friends see it. It's about time we saw a better kind of entertainment.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a bit worried about this one, especially since it was so obviously directed by the people who made the first two movies, but I was also pretty curious, and, while I could not see a great deal of the film, I did like the fact that I could see the characters at work and not just play the helpless victims of the plot (and let me make clear that, in most cases, this would not be so bad).   But, even more than that, I was interested to see what they did with the plot in the fourth film -- not so much that it had been subverted, but how they had subverted it.   The first two films had told a fairly straight-forward story, telling us that the bad guys had a big, evil, nuclear bomb called the "Death Star" that, when it comes to doing damage, is about the equal of a superweapon.  And they did so by destroying planets and killing everybody.  But this was the first time that this story had been "reinvigorated" by having the Death Star go to such a large scale and destroying planets rather than simply doing damage.  I'm not quite sure what was going on there.  For me the most interesting thing about the movie was that, though the Death Stars in this story could really destroy entire planets, it had a very different effect on their inhabitants than they were used to.  One day a guy by the name of Greedo, who was a bounty hunter, comes to a planet, and he decides to go to the "hot" planet, where he finds some people who were just living in peace for a long time.  Greedo wants to get the bounty on them, but, as it turns out, the people on this planet think he's a thief.  When Greedo doesn't come back the next day he decides that he can't stay here.  So he decides, like he always does when he's not being very subtle, that he's going to start a fight.  Sure enough, when they do their time for "resistance" they discover that Greedo had left a few days earlier with the intention of beating up one of the guys there. When he shows up to take the man down he finds the whole world turned upside down.  It turns out that every single individual on that planet is a slave, which they call "bakas" and every single person there has a "

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a lot to like about this movie (I'll be honest with you. I haven't been this excited about a movie in a long time) but in the end it just falls short of the standards I've come to expect from this genre. There's no mystery (there isn't even an explanation of why this is happening), a boring story (it ends on a bad cliffhanger), an actor who doesn't seem to have any charisma, a plot that's really just a contrivance. In the end the movie is just another mediocre thriller about the dangers of being careless in a world of technology. Maybe the film could've been more interesting if it tried to make you care about the characters, but in this film you don't. The ending is a bit of a let-down too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The biggest surprise of the movie is the quality of the cinematography by Mark Abrahams, the cinematographer of "Taken" and "Tucker and Dale vs Evil" fame. The actors deliver their lines with skill and flair, and the special effects are spectacular.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the most memorable characters in my movie. The movie starts out with a bunch of kids playing at the pool where they accidentally take the life of one of their fellow playmates when they shoot him. They decide to go up to the house to make it up to his parents. They find his body and get up the courage to ask what happened. Then a neighbor shows up who claims he saw a little girl get hit by the bus that day and then saw a truck drive up. Then they go back inside and see a little boy who has an axe and asks if they know who did this. Then the kids go to a diner and talk about what happened and find out that the girl's parents are away on a trip and the girl was playing with a doll at one point. When they go home they go and tell the little boy about what they did and then the boy turns around to say he's not going to talk with them. When the parents get home they realize the guy they saw is the boy's father who then accuses his daughter of doing this. He then throws her out the window. Then he gets in a fight with one of the other neighbors. They try to break up the fight and the neighbor with the axe gets the win. They all go back to the diner and watch the news and talk to their parents about what just happened. The girl's dad and his girlfriend come out and the boyfriend says that he saw the girl getting hit by a bus that morning. Then one of them saw a big truck drive by and one of it's doors flew open and the truck's driver pulled up and went to the backseat. The little boy looks out the back window and sees the truck pulling away from the house. He asks the father "why the truck did it?" and his dad just shrugs him off and says "Well I'm not sure."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hmmm, a remake of a remake... and so it goes!  The original was a film I absolutely loved and was lucky to see it.  It was a beautiful film with beautiful performances, but it was a long and drawn-out film with a lot of time spent talking.  I'm so sick of the remake that I may be starting my own film.   It's so good that I had to check this out.  It feels like a movie that I'm used to seeing but that I've seen it twice.  I'm sure I will see it a couple of times more!   I also agree with the reviewer below, " this remake feels like the sequel to an earlier film.         It is in the vein of the "Jaws" and "Jurassic Park" sequels."    And you know... they didn't need to remake a movie to feel like they did!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Shining" is a classic, a classic of the horror genre. If you liked "The Ring" or "The Blair Witch Project," this is the same old story, but with a different cast of characters, and a completely new setting. The film is not without its faults, but they are minor and easily forgiven. It is a great movie, a great blend of horror and comedy, but one that is best seen with a large group of people in the house. - April 22, 2010A Classic

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the same movie you've seen a million times: a beautiful woman and a very beautiful man get together and have a lovely dinner. They're very young - she's 25 and he's 14 - but they have a lot of chemistry. They are in love, and they look good together. They make out a lot and laugh a lot. I watched this with some of my best friends - we had a great time. ( I've watched this movie about five times by the way.) I give this movie 4 stars because it's a good, old fashioned rom-com and one that has a good amount of sexual tension. The acting is very good here.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best way to start the movie: the first scene in which a man is seen in a boat with a young girl. As he begins the voyage he thinks about the beautiful girl who was lying in the boat with him the previous night. The two of them are soon reunited on a boat in which people of many different nationalities live in a time-honored manner. The music is great and there is really something to the story. As the story develops this movie will be worth seeing as it will keep your attention, you just don't know when it will stop. Written by:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the best film of the year.   This movie is so much better than it sounds.  The cinematography is excellent.  It has the best action sequences in a western ever made.  In fact, the only action that this movie lacks are the ones where the heroes go to jail and get back out in time to save a young girl.  If there ever was a western where the hero came back, it's this one.  I've seen some bad westerns, but this one is one of the best.  All I'm waiting to see the new version. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best part of this movie is when we find out about the fact that the kids' parents don't seem to know why they're taking the vacation to Italy because they don't have a vacation center. And it's not like the kids are having a great time either. They're bored and their mother isn't happy that they won't get to see a lot of museums because there's so much going on. I guess it's all about the money. I don't know why the movie is rated PG, I would have watched it for free at a movie theater.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is all about how you would never think it would come to this, but here it is: a film about a man who has lost his mind after his wife is killed by a car. It is a beautiful scene: the man sitting alone, his eyes black, his back crooked and his head slumped. He has no friends, no loved ones or even his family. He knows that he would never want to have friends. All his life he has lived alone. His wife, his lover, his mother, his brother, his sister, his friend. In fact all he has ever known is loneliness. He thinks to himself: "I have nothing. No family, no friends or relatives. I feel that everyone who is about these parts lives a life that is less than life." What kind of life is it when you can't be yourself? That is why he kills himself. His last words? "I will see the next night." He's right, it is indeed time to look for a different kind of "life." I didn't like this movie, I did not. It was like watching a child play with a gun, or a child with a toy gun. A child that you do not want to hurt. I don't like violent movies, I don a great deal of research before I watch anything that has a violent plot. I just did not care about the violence and I did feel like the movie would have been better off if they had left the story there. The scenes that were meant to be funny and the way the movie was meant to end were not funny or endearing in the least.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember watching "It's a Wonderful Life" as a child in the 60's.  It is one of my favorite movies, because it is a story that is so true to our lives that it is difficult to describe.    The central character is Luke Howard (Matthew Broderick), who lived a good life until the time of his parents deaths and being given the task of raising his younger brother George (Richard Boone) and sister Lucy (Gena Rowlands).  The three children were all taught by their mother in the story,  how their father loved them and did the best he could for them.  All of their lives turned around when George's aunt died and she left him $600 which he used to purchase a train ticket to a better life.   He was sent to an orphanage on Staten Island and it was there that he met Dorothy (Joan Crawford), a young woman who also lived on Staten island.  She was sent on a train back to New York City after she died and became a surrogate aunt to George and Luke.  It was at the orphanage where George met the story's greatest character, the man who would become his father.    George would be raised by him until he was 12 years old, and then Luke was sent off to live with a couple in Chicago where he learned to be a mechanic to help make money.  Luke would return to New Jersey a few years later to become a mechanic of a local diner with the help of his cousin Charlie (John Candy) in the movie.  The film was made in 1964 and made a little over $50,000,000 when it was released (it would be beaten by "Back to the Future" the next year, which made $105,000).  Luke's dad would become the greatest man of all time in the minds of millions of people and it is because of him that his story is told.  He was a great man who always did his best.  There is no other person I believe to be greater.  As for the movie, it has a beautiful score by Elmer Bernstein, a fantastic performance by John Candy, a great supporting cast and a great story that I do not think will ever be told.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's always a good film when it's good!  In this case, it's pretty good too.  I was a big fan of J. C. Vaughn's The Big Lebowski (not a great film, but it was good) and my friends and I often joked about watching it again.  So I had to check it out when it was available on DVD in June 2005, I had been wanting to watch it for a long time.    I guess I was a bit skeptical when I saw it, but I think I might have been a bit more excited about it.  Now, this is a great, witty, quirky movie and I have to say that it is very funny from beginning to end.  We have a quirky, out-of-control bartender (Don Cheadle, who is terrific) and a weird, out of place woman (Catherine Cowser, a big smile on her face and a great accent) who get into a drunken fight when the woman sees the bartender's penis.  The guy ends up getting raped by the female, which is played with a lot of subtlety by Cowsers' portrayal (she calls the guy a "faggot," for some reason, and he can't help but laugh.  It is a funny and funny scene.)   And as it ends, you're wondering who the heck is going to be in the next one.  I am not sure if I will be watching the next film (which is probably going to have a great cast) but I am curious to see what happens to the guy who is "being" raped by a woman.  He was so drunk that when he came to he had no idea how to react (a little girl in the background was asking him what he was doing), and he actually wanted to leave, but the woman wouldn't let him leave.  Anyway, I give this one a big thumbs up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't see how anybody could have a negative reaction to a movie.   For me it was one of the best movies I ever saw.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like movies that involve two people who have some serious issues to deal with, this is a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen a lot of great movies over the years, and even more great movies from the '40s, like "The Black Stallion," "Lonesome Dove" and the "The Caine Mutiny" ( which won the Best Picture Oscar ), but this is by far the greatest film I've ever seen.   One of my favorite things about the movie is that it's a comedy, but it still has a lot to say about war, and there are also plenty of great acting performances by the great Laurence Olivier as well as the great Charles Laughton, who plays the role of Lt. Bessie in the movie.  A must see for all war veterans and anyone who cares about how the greatest movies are made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I knew when the trailer hit that I would enjoy this movie. I had high expectations for this film, and it didn't disappoint. The best part of this movie is not just the plot, but that the characters are so real. You feel like you are watching an actual person interacting with an actual human being. The acting is great. The music is great, too. I'm so glad I caught this movie when I did. It's a very entertaining movie, and not too long (a little over an hour).  The movie ends on a cliffhanger, but I think that is a good way to go out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be quite honest, I've never really seen a movie quite like "It's a Wonderful Life" as I've only ever seen it once. It's a movie that so many kids my age loved to see when they were young, but there were also many children that saw it and thought, "Hah! It's just another movie about a poor guy who makes a ton of money and then gives it all away to a lady." Well, it may not have the depth and complexity as some of the better films that come out of Hollywood, but it is a film that most all children and parents could appreciate and I can guarantee it will be remembered by kids long after "It" is gone from the box office. It is a beautiful movie, beautifully shot, written, directed and acted, but the ending of the film, is so beautiful it will make your heart soar. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is fun, it's a great action flick with a great soundtrack and great characters.

The plot is really interesting, and the good guy isn't afraid to use a little force when he has to. I'd recommend this movie to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good adaptation of a great book, written in the 1950's by the late, great Douglas Adams.  This movie is a fun and witty movie that also has the same humor that is found in the book.    There are a lot of interesting concepts, even to older audiences.  Some of these are the same as in the movie, although not nearly as obvious as in my favorite movie "Star Wars."  I found it a fun time with a good balance of humor and action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film starts out in the typical manner that most action films start. A car drives into a street in the suburbs of Miami, killing people. A cop named Kevin Trenchard (Michael Keaton), who is a retired cop from a previous police force, rushes to the scene. The movie then follows him as he investigates a series of murders, including a child that was born out of the car (we see his father in a car wreck), a pregnant woman who has been dead for some time (no explanation for this fact given), and then a group of high school students who have been "killed" by a car crash. He also becomes involved in the case of a young woman (played by Elizabeth Goodridge) who was abducted from the beach by a man wearing a clown suit. We then move to the Florida State Prison, where we see what it's like for a man who is incarcerated in a cell. We get a great look into the prison from the time that he is given a cell for "rehabilitation" (or what he believes to be rehabilitation) through all of the men in the prison who are in charge of running it, and then we see how he is treated by the guards. He was a man of integrity from the start, and even after this movie, I think it's safe to say that I still consider him one of the good guys. His interactions with the other prisoners aren't very interesting. He has few people on his side in prison besides some of the other men who had to do with the murders. Most of the time it seems as if the guards treat him like a prisoner, and that seems like it could be a problem for him. I didn't enjoy watching this movie very much, but as I said, I was in to it at the time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As you may know, the movie "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension" was a big hit at the Cannes Film Festival back in 1991. That same year, I made a short movie version. It was a simple story about a guy (me) who lives in the 8 th dimension, who finds himself in a strange parallel dimension (it's a bit more fun). I guess the movie is not so much like Buckaroo, but something similar, at least.   A new edition, with new dialogue and all, is out, and it's available at:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj4fBg1k0DU

It's one of those movies that hits all the right notes: a touching story full of love, regret, sadness, laughter, and sorrow.  A wonderful film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a movie that has it all: comedy, romance, science and a nice little adventure about dinosaurs and humans! This is what a family movie should be like, but without the corny, clichéd cliche. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  An interesting and original tale, in which young, beautiful and pretty girl is captured and raped by many different men including a huge man. Her screams are terrible when she is finally rescued but at the same time, she is still very beautiful, even after the trauma. An enjoyable film to see a beautiful girl being sexually abused by a lot of different men.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie in theaters before it was even released. I was there for the opening night.   It's an old favorite. I found myself liking the characters and feeling like I was seeing it from their point of view. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this in a movie theater as a child. It had an odd story, some sort of demon, a couple of girls and a dog named Ducky.  I found it hard to figure out how to go with it for over an hour.   This is now the only movie I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is funny to see that in my article about the greatest movie ever made about a man who has to fight to protect his young daughter from the evil forces of a cruel, scheming, murderous, and insane tyrant. I've got to admit that the evil tyrant and his evil minions are all pretty scary.  That is why I really appreciate that the film keeps the evil, evil, and evily villain in the shadows. It is very interesting to see how a man with an evil heart and an evil soul manages to control his wife and children while his son and daughter are so young and innocent and innocent too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm in love with this movie. If this is the end of it, I'll be disappointed (I was expecting a bit more), but a great action movie, some great fighting scenes, some good humor, a great plot, and a great cast, makes this a must-see, and I'm looking forward to the next one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The worst, most depressing movie ever made.   It's not that there's anything wrong with it, but it's a pathetic piece of work.  The lead actors are atrocious, the acting is atrocious.  There's nothing redeemable in this thing.  It just doesn't even try.  Not even the ending, which is so awful, can salvage anything, it's just a boring, bad, terrible, and boring movie.  If you're a horror fan, you've seen this crap. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The good:  Cameos:    From:      "Tales of Halloween:!"   It seems they're bringing me more of this!   The bad:  Well, it's still Halloween, and I guess I have to give a few of these a pass.   The other one didn't have a "Spine Tingling" so I guess it was a ghost, but even in a ghost story it was kind of lame and I still don't see how they'd use it in any of the rest of the series, but hey, at least we still got something out of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A long time ago I went to see "The Shining". I'm sure my brother and I were both really nervous about going but he said it was great. In the middle of the picture we see a little girl being kidnapped. Her mother tells her to give her a glass of water.  The mother is very distraught and says that if the girl doesn't give her water then she'll be killed, so she gives her water. As she's talking to her mother the little girl hears something on the ground behind her and goes running away. The little girl runs into the middle room where the mother is.  I don't know how long the mother's been standing over there and no one else could see her but apparently she's been there for a very, very, long time.   What we see in the picture is really cool.  After this, the mother tells the girl to get up and go outside. The girl has this weird look on her face. There's only one thing for it. She picks up the doll, puts it over her head, puts her hair up and walks out through the door.  This story was the same for a lot of people.  It may not have been as scary as it was in the cinema but if a young girl was afraid to go outside and have a look around she probably didn't do it enough. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you don't like this movie, please go watch the original. The original is superior in every way. The new take is a lot more subtle than the original but still hits all the right notes. It's great that so many people seem to enjoy this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The director and his writing partner John Milius are great story tellers. The movie is more of a thriller and that is good enough. The best bit is when the man finds the gun. Well, maybe not the best bit. It is not the first time a movie has shown the man get a gun and go on a killing spree. It does the same in the first minute and the movie does have some excellent gore. However, it is more a gun fight and less a gun whiz. The man is on a mission and this does not come as a shock. The gun he finds is a gun to the head. It has no real use. The two main characters are quite bland, they look like normal people. The one is a journalist and the other is a woman who seems to be a very nice person but is not in a lot of scenes and does not even seem like a villain. The whole movie does not really do anything original but does have its moments. I would have liked it more if the movie had more character but the movie has great gore. The actors are good, John M. Richardson is one of the best in the business and the action is great. There are some interesting ideas in the plot but are overshadowed by the violence. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very well done film, but I would not call this a masterpiece, for there is not a lot of depth here. Most of the comedy in the film seems very forced. The actors seem to act out lines as quickly as possible. The plot, if there is a plot at all, is not terribly complex or anything special. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've got to admit that the trailer for the upcoming "Crocodile Dundee: The Movie" is pretty cool.  In fact, it's pretty great!  It has some classic film noir vibes.   I wonder what's the origin of the name, "Crocko Dundee"?   If you're going to be making a movie, it might as well be a good one!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I can honestly say that I didn't know it was possible to make a film like this. I wasn't expecting a horror film in a horror movie setting, I was expecting a movie set in a world that I know and like...that is, the 1920s. The story follows a group of teenage girls who go camping on an idyllic mountain...and then are attacked by a wolf. It's actually good to have something of this kind of thing on the DVD...especially when the "bad guy" (a man who is almost entirely devoid of character) appears to be an old man with a big beard. The wolf is a creature that is truly frightening and the movie is full of all the camphor-tinged scares that you've come to expect. You also don't have to worry about the wolf coming back to get them (it probably won't), since the girl(s) don't like to play with "the beast" and try to run away. (It's not a good idea to try to get away from a wolf...even though you're about to see some nice girls getting slaughtered.) And if you do end up being "bought" by the wolf...you have about 5 minutes to figure out the solution to your predicament before you're dragged into his maw.    *I thought so...*  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would like to say that I have never seen a better action movie than this one. In addition to the action being pretty darn impressive, the film has a lot of humor. Most of the humor was delivered by James Hong. He is a lot like the "Chinaman" in the film, only a little more arrogant and slightly more of an asshole. Hong seems to think he is much better than the movie he is in. I'm not sure why this guy thinks so much of himself, since he is only acting like a complete jerk in this film. I also really enjoyed the part where Lee Byung-hun (Gangnam Style) went to work on a bank with several people. One of those people ended up getting shot, so he called the police for assistance. The police were not very helpful and only treated him very lightly until he started yelling at the police. This part of the movie was very good. The next part of this movie is when Hong goes back to Hong-Kong. In fact the police have been sent back to Korea again so it looks as though it will be another fun adventure until the movie ends. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a must watch for anyone who loves the classics. It was a big movie in its day, and is now viewed with the respect that it is due. The story is just about a man who is traveling to the West Coast to see the sights. At a train station, a girl is waiting for him. His interest is piqued, and he wants to go see her. The girl, Linda, is a California girl, and has been travelling to the west coast for a few years. She was originally from the San Francisco bay area, and now lives out west. Her husband died, and she is left with a son. One day, he picks up a phone and discovers the girl is on the radio telling of a strange occurrence in the area where they live. After looking out, he sees the lights, and follows them through a tunnel of water. There are four beings with red eyes. They are like the evil spirits of some of the Native Americans who once lived there. These aliens are not looking for a peaceful way to die. They would rather kill this poor young man, who is just trying to live his life. Linda's husband does not believe her son, that this is all a dream, and decides to tell his wife. Linda is angry. She has been told of this phenomenon. She cannot imagine how it could have happened. She thinks that the boy is just being silly. But the boy refuses to believe it. He does not realize how the story that his father tells him is a true tale. After some time of talking to this strange being, Linda's son realizes that he will not be seeing his mother again. The creature is very curious, and starts to talk about the "old days" when he came to earth. Linda, however, cannot believe that this creature is talking about her husband, and so she decides to follow the creature back to San Francisco. However, it stops, and does not continue further. The man decides to try and call someone, and then realizes that the creature is still following him. It stops again, and returns to the water that it came in. The woman is distraught over what this means to their family. But, before she can do anything else, she is called back. She takes her son out of the house and locks it up until she can return home. There, she finds that the son is gone, and that Linda is missing. The family is distraught. At the hospital, Linda

It was a nice day to take my kids to go play.  I didn't know I would like the movie, but it was actually pretty good.  As I said earlier.  These movies were made when they had the budget.  The story itself wasn't original but the art and animation was.  There was also an interesting idea in the storyline that I will never forget from watching the movie for the first time.  When I think about all the great movies that are out there.  This movie just makes me feel warm inside. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The fact that John Wayne was in the movie doesn't tell you anything about the quality of the movie. The main star of the picture was Lee Marvin who did a good job in the role of "Gung Ho" but Wayne's performance was a little below the line. This is one of those pictures that you don't need to have been in Hollywood to understand. I was at one of the premiere of the film in Dallas, Texas. It was a big hit at the movie theaters and it was at least good to watch. I remember this film because I didn't understand a word that Wayne was saying and I had never seen a film where Wayne's voice wasn't a little bit strange. I had seen some of the others but this was probably the one that I had the most trouble with. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very solid film, and a good story to start with.   I can't remember exactly how the film starts. It seems like a typical spy movie in that everything is a big mystery. There are a few clues which will get you to a place where things start to get interesting and a few "action moments" ensue. Then, the film shifts from being about a spy who spies and a little more about how spy movies are made.  And then we have this strange mix of spy movies and psychological thrillers, and this is where things get fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  So, here is my big gripe with this movie, which is that, it is not very well told or acted and I have to admit I could not follow most of the dialog or the conversations between the characters. Even the most complicated scenes are often not given enough detail to make out what is actually going on, and that's pretty bad as far as action movies go. I'm not sure if my feelings on this movie are purely negative or not because the characters do act strangely or don't really act in a very believable manner at times, but this is one movie I'm never going to watch again, no matter how much I think it would make a good Halloween movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun little film from a very talented director who does not miss a trick on his own. It is a darkly humorous film with a bit of comedy sprinkled throughout. The humor is pretty much on-point, but there are some moments where a bit more realism could have improved it. There's also some great performances from the leading roles, but it was the cast that made the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me,  this movie is a perfect example of how a good action/thriller should be. If I were a fan of this kind of movie,  I would definitely check it out. This movie is great at what it does: it keeps us on the edge of our seats, and when the action goes over the top,  it keeps it from being too extreme.    This movie's an old school action movie in many ways,  with a plot that has twists that keep us all on the brink of our seat.  It's a perfect movie to see before or after a good old fashioned car crash,  if only it's not so long.  There are some great action sequences, and the director seems to know where he's going with the pacing, which works.  This is a movie, that should be seen and enjoyed by everyone, even if you're a little old school.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was watching "Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope" on my laptop when I felt an unfamiliar, but distinctly pleasant vibration. I looked up to see what it was about, and saw a white man, with a long white beard, staring intently at me. He told me that I must go to the bar. I didn't say anything; it wasn't like I'd have a choice. He then told me to get in the car, and we went down the road to the end of a narrow lane, which soon turned into a wide, empty, road. After a couple of hours of driving we arrived at a white house. Inside was a large white, rectangular door. We stood at the entrance and waited for a man. We didn't have a lot of time to find out what that man would do, because he didn't turn up. We went back to the house, and I was invited inside by the owner. We talked for a while, then he told me he wanted me to work on some problems. I started out working on an old computer with an old power cord, and after a few hours I had to call out to him to come back outside. When he came back, he put a pair of glasses on my head, and walked around my desk, looking at my work. He asked me if I didn`t like my work, and told me I wasn't doing anything interesting or important. I said I didnít like what I had, but I didn´t say anything else because I didn\'t want to sound rude. He gave me a business card and told to come in the next day at noon. I went out to the car the next morning to get my bag and watch some television. I found the house empty. The guy wasn't in my office for the first time; I found him in the middle of the street. I saw he had a long, long beard, which he put up. I thought that he was the only one who had that long beard. I decided it was worth visiting him again, and asked him if he was still a friend of my friend. He said he didníd thought about it and wouldnít talk about it. I talked to him a little, and he told how he was looking forward to seeing me again. He put his glasses back on, and left us. I was a bit disappointed when I couldn't have him as a friend; I really like
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a film that captures the essence of a bad movie: a bad girl with a bad haircut, a bad boyfriend and the occasional "wedding" that gets interrupted. I thought a couple of times during the film when the bad girl was getting ready to go out. I didn't like the "wicked wench" look she had and I would not like any role she is supposed to play. What did a wench look like in the 19th century? I don't think so.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a year where few films hit their marks, 'No Man's Land' is a solid film with a handful of memorable moments.  This one also contains a few of the best set pieces to ever come out of the genre, and there are several scenes that will stick in your memory for a long time.   A well made historical drama about a group of American soldiers who get caught in the middle of World War I.  The film is about as good as it gets when it comes to World War 1 and it does not disappoint.  The story is told from various angles and takes various paths but it all comes together in a rather unique way.   The cast in No Man's land is great, but it may be the best cast the genre has had in a very long time, especially if you get used to the way they talk.  I have always been a fan of Robert Mitchum as he is an interesting character even though he is not given the amount of screen time and screen time only he should be given.  It is also fun to see an older Mitchum on screen as he shows a bit of age as he becomes more senile.  There is also some great performance by William Holden as well.  All in all, a very well done film, I would definitely recommend it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great science fiction movie with lots of awesome imagery, a very engaging story, and some great special effects. There's no doubt about it that this movie would be an obvious contender for any science fiction fan's list. And it is that, but there are things to be said about this movie that, while not an epic masterpiece, is quite good. It certainly beats most of the rest of the "Star Wars" movies, at least as far as this genre is concerned. The whole story takes place over six months of space flight between two planets; one in the far future that will be much more civilized than the more primitive world that is depicted in the prequels. There are a number of different characters that we meet and a story that is told throughout those six months: first, the characters of the main characters; then, some of the crew members as they deal with the various problems that will have to be solved; then the crew itself trying to cope with the demands of the job; finally, there is the planet that the crew has to fly over in order to get back to civilization; the crew then have to deal with that planet's weather, with the danger of the other planets and space travel, and with the lack of a proper oxygen supply on the planet. But, after all that, there really is no real climax in this movie, though there are some good scenes, such as the scene in which a comet passes by, the ship flying around and the various planets being destroyed by the comet; those are good scenes. There is also an interesting scene of the alien creature trying to kill the captain with a harpoon, which is a good example of a scene that has some good animation. Unfortunately, the rest that the movie does have is mediocre, and it lacks any real sense of urgency. And there is a lot of nonsense to distract you from the story: a woman who is a bit more intelligent than the rest, a scene with three people dancing in space, a girl who is the captain's assistant who knows all about the other ships he's been flying, and various more. And, really, how many other space movies would have all that? This movie really is nothing special, other than the fact that it is a great sci-fi movie that you can watch and enjoy at the same time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not expect to love this movie. But I did! I liked the movie. I liked most of the actors (particularly George, who played a very sweet man in my opinion) and I didn't like the story at all. So in my mind, the film was doomed from the beginning. This is a film written by an old man. We have an old black man who is living alone in the woods. We see that he's lonely. He has nothing to offer to the world. A girl asks him for help and he agrees. She comes and goes until one day she is there again. He sees her every day, but she never says anything about her home. This continues for a while but something happens to her. She takes an interest in a strange man who comes to the woods to pick a white bird to eat. He is a handsome and well-dressed man who appears to be a professional hunter. But things don't go well and he loses his way, loses his weapon, gets lost, and has to find his way back by looking in different places. His friends, whom he thought were his friends are all in love with him, but all of them want to go on with their lives. He finds that the white bird is very old and that he must find it. The film was not very bad. It was enjoyable for a couple of minutes, and it seemed to me that the writers took the premise of "how a man would try to find a bird that would be worth more than a dollar" and ran with it. It's a cute idea. It wasn't well written though. The story had the feeling of a child's book. I think that this is why some people (myself included) like to call it a "children's film." It seemed very simple. The acting was not bad either. The people playing the roles seemed to have a lot of time to talk. The actors were not afraid of the material. I didn´t like the idea at all though. I had a good laugh at the beginning and at the end when it was all over. I hope that the producers and the story writers can get to work on a good script for a new film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie isn't about the Vietnam War. This movie is about a war on the West Coast from the 1970's that I was totally unable to get into. It seemed to me that this would be about the war in Korea, but the fact that the North Koreans have been winning battles against all odds is never mentioned.  My rating: 3. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never been a big fan of the 80's/90's (though I love the original Star Wars trilogy) but this movie is still pretty great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film that would go on to become the greatest comedy of all time is as silly as it is funny, and just as hilarious to its audience. The film was produced in 1952 and released in 1953 and it features the original cast and the only new cast member being the late Peter Boyle, who, according to the story, was working for a restaurant in Los Angeles when he met the "original" comedian and decided to follow him to Hollywood. Boyle went on to act in and act out a number of different comedy roles over the years. A number of other well known actors, including Peter Falk, Billy Wilder, Howard Mehl and Robert Redford, also play their parts in the film.    What I have to say about this film is that, like the comic version that it spawned, it is completely and utterly ridiculous. You might have heard that there were some very silly sketches made in the same year that the film was made, including a sketch in which a waiter who had just arrived for his shift was asked if he wanted a cup of coffee. The waiter replies "What's a coffee?". And then he sits down, has coffee and says: "So I am now a coffee". Which is all very well and good, but in the midst of this comic and rather silly story, a series of events start to occur which make it pretty clear that this was a comedy that was not going to survive.  The plot of the film is based around a group of actors that includes: Peter Boyle who plays the title role, who is played by a clown called Fred Allen. Boyle himself plays the role of "The Comedian", a role that he is to have played in many comedies and which is to be repeated a number time over the film's running time. Fred Allen is the young actor playing the part of the waiter who has just arrived in town at a certain time of the day. Fred has arrived a little late, and is in such a hurry to get his breakfast and his coffee that he has no time for anything. So, like all of the other characters in the movie, he is in a hurry because he has to be somewhere as soon as possible. The others include: Bob Hope as "The Sheriff" who is all dressed up as a sheriff, and there are other actors all dressed in the "silly outfits" that you all know, which is all well and fine, but we must move on now.  When I saw the movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The main character plays an officer in the National Security Police. Her job is to investigate various cases and to make a public record of them. The story is not very good. It has one good moment, where she is trying to arrest the most notorious criminal, and all she can do is give a lecture on the necessity of not going to the extreme to catch criminals, but to be more cautious. This is typical of a good detective story: one big "one-liner", some great scenes, and a moral that is not too far from what some old-fashioned American writers had to say about criminals. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There is a little girl in the movie that looks like the girl from the Disney movie "The Little Mermaid". This little girl, is called Alana, and she was always a little annoying. And she kept calling her mother a "sugar mouth". And it's not her father that has "sug" in his name, it's his uncle! And it gets worse. After the movie, Alana is still a little too annoying, and I thought that Disney couldn't have the talent to make a good Disney movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the words of one reviewer: "a movie of the most unusual cast of characters to be found, all playing off each other."    A fascinating and funny comedy, it stars an unlikely assortment of actors: two actors of the great William Wyler (in a role previously played by a more recognizable, and much longer acting career); a comic actor named Al Moore; and two of the greatest comic actors, Harold Lloyd and Danny Kaye.   The movie is about a guy who's in an elevator in his apartment building, where the elevators have all stopped working. The guy finds out that his son, who lives at his apartment in New York, isn't there.  Then he goes and tells him, and the son is gone.  He finds out then that his daughter has gone to California, leaving his job as a bank robber at the bank, and it seems that he's getting tired of life. Then he hears a voice telling him that a girl was in the elevator with him.  The voice is really a woman. And it's not one of his daughters.  As the voice says: "Hey, I thought I'd check on you."  And the man has to do the voice, because it's impossible to get a film like this made today. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't know how many of you remember the classic David Lynch movie in which David Lynch plays himself in a dream. It was one of those movies which I thought I had seen all and even if I had it's still a good flick. The one thing which was a surprise to me was the fact that it had a strong female lead. She is a bit like a French film star, with an easy going charm. She also seems to have a bit of a secret life, like a lot of the characters in Lynch movies. There are other good female characters but the one we see the most is The Nanny. She plays a sort of love interest for The Napper, but she also has her own little drama going on. It's a good mix of a love triangle, comedy, and drama that I didn't really know anything about before seeing the movie.   Another thing that might remind you of the original movie is the name of the restaurant. "Chum" is also the name for the original bar in the movie, which is in a French style, and is where the character of The Nappy is introduced. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's easy to hate a movie like this one when you know nothing about it. The only reason it's good is that the film is very well-crafted, and that the story is well-developed. That's all it needs. But there's nothing like a little gore to brighten up a dull afternoon.

It's a place that teaches all the leading arts - music, painting, drama, etc. There's a "great" conductor called Jean-Luc Godard, with whom, as a student, you learn a lot - not about music, but about film. Godard is famous not so much for his filmmaking, as for his "greatest" works - but there's no other film in the world like it - the director of The Birds, which is still remembered today as one of the greatest movies ever made. Godards's film is essentially a dream - the world is a place where we don't have to have to work. No one needs to work - everything is given to us. This is the dream that Godard had since he was a child, and it's the first time he has ever been able to express it fully. GodARD's dream was to live in this world, without any effort, and no responsibility. His only aim is to create a completely different world where you can just hang around and watch people doing everything that they are supposed to do. There are no rules - all of the actions in the film are spontaneous - Godard creates an idyllic world where the only difference between one person and another is in their clothes. The film is a great example of what has been called "the dream of every artist", and it is the most beautiful example of how to make a dream come true. Godart's film was so beautiful, that many critics called it a masterpiece. However, this is a film of the last century - in the last 20 years the concept of the dreamworld has changed, and the reality in which Godard lived has vanished. It's quite a pity, because there's a lot of good stuff in there, not least the beautiful acting, that makes us dream about the dreams! The film is, of course, a masterpiece - but it's not as great as the dream. The dreams come back to life during a party of the director and a group of other directors (notably Jean-Louis Trintignant, Jean-Claude Carriere and the great Claude Rains), where Godard has a great party - everyone goes to a house where, for the first night, all the dreams

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found this to be an interesting story about a group of friends. I loved the idea of a small town being able to come together after the tragedy, as everyone comes together to try and make up for what happened.   This could have been a really good movie if they had put in better acting and good music. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the sort of movie that I like to watch when my wife and I are out and about. Our local bar in my neighborhood is the place we go to watch movies when the sun is down and the bars are quiet. I really hope that they have more movies like this one to be released here in America. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love the 80's and especially the 80s Sci-Fi movies.  When the story is slow enough the characters and the setting are interesting enough.  There is a good amount of sex and nudity but most of it is played for laughs.  The acting is also good.  For a non-Sci-Fi movie they chose a good time to film.  I recommend it to all Sci-fi fans and those who like good comedy.  Thanks to the wonderful Steve Martin, a man of action.    Rated R for crude language and violence.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie takes it's time and doesn't give in to silly melodrama but instead takes a long hard look at the things it has to face: the war on drugs, the "war on terror" which has seen the USA kill people in Afghanistan, the "War on terror' which has made a large part of the Middle East a battlefield. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've heard great things about this film but I haven't seen it yet.   For the most part, a classic of its kind; a true story of the rise and fall of an old timer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a wonderful time watching this movie.   It was a nice change of pace to watch a film with some blood and guts.  A couple of times I had to laugh at how it played out, because it felt like there was something in the air.  It took a while for the killer to get to us but the story eventually started to follow.  There were many twists and turns and the audience could see some of them coming in real time.  I got the feeling it had the potential to be a good flick and then a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you've seen the trailers you might think of The Thing as a monster-movie - but the movie is much more. It is a film about a man who is very very isolated from the outside world - a man on a lonely island who wants to see the world from the top of his mountain. And it is all set against a very beautiful background. But the real power of The Trip is the way it brings together these three very different characters. There are some pretty amazing performances from Bruce Willis, Billy Zane and the great Tim Robbins. But it is Robbins who really stands out - there is so much energy in his performance as The Trip. He is just so different from anyone else in the movie. When he's the one who wants the trip to begin it's a truly unforgettable scene. And Robbins' performance in general is so powerful - you almost forget that the movie isn't really about him at times. There is just a strong sense of being an outsider in a very strange world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would recommend this movie to everyone. A film with some of the best acting I've ever seen in my life (including some of my favorite actors). The story is so compelling that you feel like a character in a movie (even if it isn't a film). The soundtrack is phenomenal. The film is also the very definition of good times with excellent performances. One of the reasons this is so great is because it's the definition of "one of those things that never should have happened"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For a film that cost just a few thousand dollars, Star Wars: Episode II, doesn't waste a lot of time at all. There's a lot going on, as usual, but this time the movie isn't just about a bunch of wannabe space-bunnies, it's about the old ways. Luke Skywalker's quest to save his friends and family from an evil Empire has always been a big part of the Star Wars fantasy - and now we get to relive the old adventures with all the old characters (at least in this movie), from C-3PO to Jabba the Hutt to... Jabba! I mean, the guy looks so ridiculous and pathetic, and he seems to just want to give Han Solo a hard time for no reason! It's great to see these characters in action again, and the special effects are excellent, thanks to the wonderful animatronics from Jim Henson's Creature Shop. In a perfect world this would be my "Star Wars" favorite film, but I can't bring myself to give this one a perfect 10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was sooo fun! It had a bunch of good jokes and was really well done. It had great acting and really made my night. One of my favorite movies ever!  I don't really get the joke here.   This seems like a parody of the Twilight films of the 70s in which there's this teen who can go from having sex with a bunch young men to being a college student and not realizing it. When she finally meets a couple of guys she thinks are a couple and goes on a date with them, but then they find out the girl's a total slut and want her in bed.  In other words, she falls in love with a guy and has sex with him and realizes she's a whore.  After the movie ends she sees herself as a total loser who is totally alone and will never find love or have a fulfilling life. The only solution is for her to get a job and have a job on her own because all these guys are complete and utter morons.  This is a great movie and a must-see for the Twilight fan!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about a crazy guy who loves to ride his motorcycle around the city. In fact, his obsession is so strong that it is often more of a distraction than a pleasure to see him.  This was made more interesting by the fact that we see many characters that we're not supposed to know about.  The movie is funny and full of great riding action, but it is not really a serious movie.  Even though it has many "stars," the acting is not very good.  My favorite is the crazy woman who rides the motorcycle.  So don't let your kids or pets ride motorcycles. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first three films were all really good, but the fourth is the best of the series. It's fun, funny, and a lot of fun to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I have never seen a film that made me weep like this one does, and I saw it before I had a girlfriend so I can't say it was the first one that made that emotional connection. It was a sad and depressing movie; you never quite believe that a movie can be so emotionally devastating, and this is not a movie that just makes you cry. It's a movie about love. If you are looking for a movie to watch where you can laugh at how much this movie sucks and be entertained by the dialogue, this isn't it. It is hard to be happy watching a movie like this, but a movie is a movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An absolutely terrific movie!   Director: Michael Mann is a superb filmmaker; a master storyteller, who will leave you breathless with his beautiful, poetic, and masterfully constructed narrative!  It is a brilliant film; beautifully shot and full of atmosphere.   This is not only the most beautiful movie I have ever seen, but one of the most beautifully written, too.      I absolutely loved Michael Mann's movies and this is by far his best one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first half of the film was a good introduction to the character. It gave a very good introduction in how he was treated by the other characters, how he treated them, why he behaved the way he did, and how he learned to be a better character. And I'm glad it was that. It also gave us the beginning of what the film is all about. How the kids are being manipulated by the adults of the town. And they're doing it to them in order to get a favor. In this case, a favor to the rich kid, whose name is Mr. Black, who is one of the more interesting characters in the movie. He is actually a good guy who doesn't deserve to be manipulated like that. But he's not really the most important character in the film. He's a bit annoying (I like that about him) but at the same time he seems somewhat sympathetic because he has an interesting past. I'm not sure if he's a villain yet but he's definitely not a good character. He tries to manipulate and be likeable in order for the others to do the same thing to him. This is a pretty simple plot. And yet it's so well done. And so different. It's just so... well, fun!  I really liked the characters, and I think they were the best part of the movie in my opinion. And the kids were all so adorable! There were so many different types of kids. There were all kinds of different situations they ended up in, each with a different outcome. I liked the movie because I think it had a lot of potential. I think the story itself was really interesting and I enjoyed most of the characters involved.  The music in the middle of the story was a little strange, but was still very well done and really helped to set the mood.  It was probably not as successful as the first half, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most fun, ridiculous, and well acted action-comedy movies I have ever seen.   The film opens with a rather dull man (Peter Cushing) getting off a train on an unnamed island in the Pacific Ocean.  When his luggage is searched at the baggage claim, his clothes have disappeared and are found to have been sewn by a female with a man's face.  Cushing's only hope of escape is to disguise himself as a woman and go ashore in the company of a pair of Chinese smugglers (Jack Klugman and Gary Lockwood).  Cushed meets them and after a brief exchange of words, they have Cushing arrested and taken to a prison where two of the guards are Chinese (the other being a man named Cheng Cheng).  The guards are not very friendly toward Cushing, and after he is tied up and stripped naked, a fight ensues between him and the guards.  The fight is very entertaining, with Cushing in many costumes and costumes, and in a series of different, interesting costumes, often very bizarre.  There is a great deal of sexual humor as well, though not by any means gratuitous.  A few years later, Cushing makes a brief but brief escape.  As the story closes, it is not clear what has become of Cushing.  While the picture is a good one, I am glad I was only a kid, since many of the jokes were very immature. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While I have never been a huge fan of horror comedies (as evidenced by my rather negative opinion of The Woman Who Slept with Sam, or the fact that I still haven't seen it), I do find the concept of being trapped in a small town haunted by a "vampire" quite interesting and a little clever.  The screenplay is very good, even if the scares are a little excessive.   For the last several years, I have been watching TV shows with my father when we watch "Sightings" as a family.  I think this movie is great because it is a blend of all those horror movies I have watched over the years with a dash of supernatural action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A simple yet beautiful story about the way of being and the way to live. And the way you can be a good girl or a bad girl, too. Goodness. A simple, beautiful movie that is about a very common situation, and about life. And about a simple way of living your life. It is an extremely well filmed movie, the director, the actors...all are so good and good looking. It's a great movie...if only it were real.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good science fiction movie, but that science fiction has to be delivered to your imagination. I was surprised to discover that you're not supposed to see a film that is set in space, but you can. It was only when they showed us around that I remembered that this space was a miniature one that looks like it was constructed by a teenager in a garage. But it doesn't take a space craft to set this space in motion. Space is made for two people who are very much in love. Well, for one and one only... It's as if they've been playing together their whole lives, and they have no idea about anything else. They've always had a thing for each other, but it used to be a secret, a forbidden one. As the story proceeds we get a glimpse of their lives in their youth, and this is when the real magic begins. As they grow and learn more about each other they become more and more inseparable. When the woman's husband comes home (he is quite old) he discovers a long-time affair between his sister and his niece. The sister was just an ordinary girl, until she was visited by aliens. Now she is an alien girl who is able to speak their language. When she is about to tell the little girl, the two sisters find themselves in a space ship, a small one, barely big enough for them. At first things are fine, until the spaceship starts experiencing strange and frightening behavior. It's at this point that the movie takes an unexpected turn, and all the magic comes to a sudden stop. There are a few strange things about this movie, one is the fact that the first twenty minutes or so, the entire plot is shown in this one shot, in a very small space. It is an odd thing to see, and I found it fascinating. Another thing is that there's only one person in the film who isn't a man, and she isn't even on screen. This is perhaps the first time I've seen a movie where women are the main characters. That woman is actually the most interesting of the film, not only because she's the one with an interesting sex life, but she also has the most unusual personality. We can't say she's "normal," but she does seem very normal for a space person. She does have some odd interests, such as being able to touch things with her hands, but her most unusual trait is that she's able to control gravity.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went in expecting a straight down the middle straight forward thriller, but what I got was a twist that almost took me by surprise.  It starts out with our main character, Jack, a retired special forces sniper on assignment for a top secret, highly classified organization, the OCP, who is investigating a deadly and mysterious series of murders.    He's a highly trained sniper, trained to kill.  But when Jack gets hired to help the OCCP with a possible break in in their investigation Jack finds himself on the run from the law.  The first person we meet in the film is a local bar owner/dude named Harry.  He is the best man at Jack's wedding.  Harry has a son, and Harry's wife has been dead for a few years.  She was killed by an overdose of morphine.  Once in the office Jack is asked to assist the OOCP in their investigations.  Jack soon finds out that not only are they not to be trusted, they actually have a huge amount of powerful information about the OCCC.  There are clues which point to people who do not want them to find out about the killer.  And not only is there a killer on the loose, but there are several accomplices with even more powerful information.  In the end, we see how the police are able to find the killer before any of the others do.  It's an amazing movie and an enjoyable watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are a few scenes that make it seem like there is no way that the movie could be good. But it's not. It's really good. So good that you have to re-watch it over and over again, to make sure it's what you really think. It is a movie that is like nothing else: one of the few things that make me feel like I know where I am as a human being. I like to think that there is a reason why some people seem so damn happy. But I can't find it. I do know this: it is a film about love, and hope, and survival, that will make you smile and shake your head at the same time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a funny movie and a good time, and I would recommend it to everyone. I thought it was very funny and well-written. It was funny, well paced and well produced. It's a story about a couple trying to keep their relationship in control even as the other one falls apart and has the mental breakdown of his life. There are a couple of little humor scenes at the end that were a lot of fun to watch. I am not quite sure if I will watch the film again, since it is a bit over the top at times. This is just an entertaining movie that was fun to see.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I always love a good horror movie, especially when the monster was played by one of my favorite actors.   For those who haven't seen the original movie, you should definitely watch it before trying to watch this remake.  This was actually filmed at the same time as  the original, but was re-dubbed a couple years later.  In this movie, we get to see more of Freddy Krueger, and as you will see he is a much different individual than the one in the original.  The film starts off slow as we wait patiently for the police to arrive at the home of a woman who was seen "going crazy" with no explanation.  After the officer arrives, he is quickly told to leave the house because it is occupied and no one would believe a woman had left her home because of what she was wearing.  When the officer comes back, he says it was his own idea to go to the property to look for a woman.  He then tries to make a quick decision by asking the homeowner if she was in bed with a man.  She answers no, but then she "crouches" and puts her finger in her mouth and smiles.   After the first few seconds, you are really shocked at the change in personality.  It is a good change of pace, as it is a lot more believable than the original, and it shows that the police officer truly believed this woman. However, there are two problems in the film.  First, the film doesn't make a good use of the "Freddy's Theme" at all.  Freddy is back, in his first appearance in a while, and he is much different in the remake. He looks like a bad guy from a horror movie from the 80s instead of a horror villain who is played by a real scary monster. The second problem is that we can never really find out what the situation is with the woman in the house.  Even though the house is occupied, no one is able to help the police.  I can't even imagine how bad a situation this woman is in.  However, for a film so bad, the acting is pretty good.  Sam Rockwell is a very good actor in this film. His character, David, is much more in control of his actions than his original, which shows that he is an intelligent character.  If you like bad movies, this is a great way to watch them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good comedy movie and I love it. And I would like to see more films like this because I think that these movies are very funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the early 90's there was a cartoon about a talking raccoon who fought against a giant evil bird and then found a place on a giant airplane.   After the credits rolled this movie was not funny.  I was bored, and the only thing that gave me any excitement was the scene where Mr. Bumblegasm had a fight with another animal like Mr. Rock-a-Roo.  It was just like all the other bad cartoons they made back then!   If anyone was going to do a cartoon based on a movie by the writer of Dr. Demento they would do better with a bad cartoon about the writer!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To sum up, this movie is just an old classic about a small town that is still going strong. You get the feeling it was made in a garage and it was done by the guys that do the local comedy scenes: Steve Martin and John Candy. A small town comedy that is sure to have a lot of laughs, especially when the "barn" starts having problems with a small dog. A very good, cheap flick that would have worked well in a lot better movies, like 'A Christmas Story', or 'A Night to Remember'.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One thing the first half of the film seems to have learned from its mistake is to focus on the characters (well, the one male one) at their worst rather than focusing on the more subtle moments that give the film its atmosphere and give a sense of a very specific kind of place and time in the early 1900s.  The film was made in 1913 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the founding of what is now known as the United States of America, or what is referred to as "America" or "America Day". The movie is set at the beginning of the century, and there is a lot of "new" stuff and modernist ideas about politics and commerce that are presented to the country at large, and one can get a sense that they feel like the first signs of a new time. The film also gives a sense at this point that Americans have been living the good life without much worry about anything. The idea that there was to be a war with Spain and a terrible war is a good one to set up and to explore the kind of attitudes in the era, although it doesn't really have the impact that the story needs to have for it to be very interesting. As for the characters, they come off a little too smug. But it's a well-made film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like this movie (and it should be on every viewer's DVD shelf) then you've just found another one:  One of the best'movies' from the 90's, and a very enjoyable one at that.   The movie is a comedy/romance with a good cast and nice acting.  A little silly at times, the movie is actually well written and I loved the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would describe "The Wolf" as a post apocalyptic film that looks to the past to find a modern way to deal with it. The film is well written and acted with great visuals. You get to see a future that has become a dystopian nightmare in just 5 minutes and the movie even comes with a bonus song written in 1957 by The Everly Brothers. This is an interesting post apocalyptic movie that does a nice job of showing some of the problems and solutions that are coming our way and what will be done to deal.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good and well-done remake of a classic 1950s movie.  The plot is familiar, the actors are good, the sound is good.   I do wish that the story wasn't so familiar.  This film is just plain old science fiction.  It has nothing to do with the 1950s, it is just a boring story about a space captain and a girl.  I don't see this movie as being an important step forward for sci-fi.  Instead it is merely another example of the movie craze that is sweeping the world right now. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is an absolute treasure.   It has just about everything that you want from a movie: a good old fashioned car chase, a good car, great acting, even a nice chase through some old buildings.  What was missing was a great villain who would get out of the car every time he got in it.  But I was pleased with what happened.  There was no fight in the movie as the chase was very well done.  A very entertaining movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was not sure about this movie prior to seeing it. I had heard good things about the film being a comedy, but the trailer made me think of something more along the lines of "Gangster Squad". That is not a bad thing at all and this movie is one heck of a blast from the past. The cast is all fantastic including the always entertaining Robert Duvall as a tough yet kind cop and the ever brilliant John Goodman as the slick, witty but always a little crazy mob boss. This is one movie I will definitely revisit.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are two types of people in this world: the people who have seen a ton of action films, and those who haven't. This movie is a combination of both these kinds of people, with some truly brilliant moments mixed in. This is more of a thriller/action movie than an action film per se, it's more like something out of Die Hard, not really sure what to think of this. The action scenes are very well done and the actors all do well for themselves, and as someone who loves John Travolta I was impressed. This was a fun movie.   Don't bother watching this movie if you can't handle action. It has some action (which I'm told is pretty well done) but it's not nearly as good as an action movie should be. This should not be the movie that starts us on a good action movie run.  , 1/5

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was an excellent movie. I never read the comics, nor the TV show, and so I found the movie to be an excellent watch. The first couple of minutes of the movie are very well done and a lot of fun. I laughed a lot. It doesn't feel out of place here in the 1970's as opposed to the '90's. The movie doesn't stick to the "dance party" formula. It's different. The characters are well-drawn and have personalities. The cast is very well cast. The action is well done, and I enjoyed the chase scenes as well. I can't imagine a better movie to watch on a Monday night.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best of the bad:  In terms of genre, "Shades of Blue" can most easily be defined as an action comedy. The two most prominent characters are played by Jeff Bridges and Danny DeVito. They are, quite simply, badasses, and they love doing the things that get them into trouble. I enjoyed watching both of them get into some very, very funny and, in a strange way, quite touching situations. The bad guys are as bad as they come, the police, even the good guys, and the good news is that they don't care.    This movie has a strange sense of humor. It's the kind of humor that seems completely impossible to execute correctly, yet it makes perfect sense for the characters who are so obviously not supposed to be funny. I'm quite curious about the director, the writer, and I have yet to see anything he's done. If he can even get his story out of the rough draft he got from some guy in the parking lot of the grocery store, then I'll be very interested. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well this movie is very good, so let me start with my first negative:  This movie is so funny!  I saw this movie on Friday in a crowded movie theater.  I came in really hungry.  The popcorn was in the theater and I was happy to find it.   I was surprised when I was told that this movie would be "a comedy, and it was"   The only thing that I don't like about this movie are the silly dialogues in the beginning.  It takes a while to get going.  If you look out the back of the theater you can see the popcorn.  What you really want is the movie that you want to see, so you go watch it.    I think this movie was just as much fun as I remember.  This is a fun little comedy and will probably be seen on a loop.  You can see it on YouTube:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7Kk9ZN2HbU

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you ever thought you would enjoy getting lost in a bad movie, then I must recommend that you should watch it.   This movie is a complete mess of a movie and one which will never be mistaken for an average movie.    If you are at all squeamish about movies, you may want to avoid this one.  The plot is a bit ridiculous and the characters are awful.  However, the movie is not at all terrible.  One of the best parts about the film is the fact that it has many different styles of film; it's really not all that hard to follow the plot.  A few parts are great, a few bad, and a few indifferent. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great film about a guy who finds himself in a lot of strange situations, and one of them is to be in the same room with a bunch of dead people.   The film is well-paced, exciting, and quite gruesome. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There isn't much to say about the story of the movie. It is basically a collection of vignettes. From the intro to the ending, the movie shows the daily life of a man who, having had no experience in life, has been thrown into the company of a group of misfits. In particular, we get to see how various members of the gang treat each other in various ways. As the film progresses, we see their interactions with each other develop, and we see how they change. We also see the growth of each of the characters in terms of both character and personality. The movie is definitely a work of art, and it is well worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie doesn't take long at all to get going. The first half of the movie takes us to a very quaint, very small town. It seems that we are the only characters who remain alive since the fire that killed the rest of us. That makes for some interesting tension, and it is always fun to watch the characters interact with the townspeople. For example, we see a couple that are clearly unhappy. After the husband leaves them, they go out for coffee and then go to a restaurant to spend their money. We see a dog that we know is going to be a pet, and we find out who it is that is going on a vacation later that night. That's pretty much it for the first half, though the third half is where the movie really takes off. At the end of the third act, we find that the main character, a young man who is living in a hotel, has an encounter with a woman who is the leader of a cult.   There are certainly a lot of creepy-looking cults in movies, and even a cult movie in a horror movie like this would not be complete without a few people wearing masks.  It's a fun film, and I do have to say that it looks great.  At one point, a woman goes into the hotel with the idea of taking a photo of a dead woman that's hanging from a hook.  I really enjoyed it, and the actors all did a great job.  There is a lot to like here, and if you've read my reviews before, I do know that there is a movie out there that I would love to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a surprise that I enjoyed this movie so much. Not just the acting, but the storyline! There wasn't anything like it in Hollywood. There were some very subtle, beautiful touches that I missed while watching this movie. I was surprised that even this movie had enough violence to keep us entertained. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The premise sounds like a joke: a rich man decides to try and win a woman from a group of "bad" people. Well, this man, the man who is so rich he has a private jet, and who is one of the richest men alive, is absolutely amazing at picking up beautiful women. He spends an entire day with one of them, but she's not the one he wants. Well then, the next day comes and the same thing happens and the woman has absolutely nothing in common with the man she had just met. This is when the guy takes the woman from the hotel to a yacht and they go to the beach, only to find out that the woman doesn't want to be there. Well of course, this was the perfect way to end her stay with him. But then she runs away, and the next time he goes out to find her, it turns out she was murdered and the killer has already gone. All of this is happening just so a rich guy can have the beautiful woman he has been chasing for three days. At least I never understood how someone with a private plane could have a private woman like this, but even a rich woman should be able to find someone like this.   I did like this movie, and it's a good one. There was no sex in it, and that's not a bad thing, but the whole thing is so unrealistic I just found myself rolling my eyes the whole way through. The movie is funny, and I always like that about it. However, this movie was a disaster from start to finish. It doesn't hold a candle to the original, and this movie doesn't even attempt to be anything like the original. I don't hate it, but it wasn't worth the money I spent on it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was filmed mostly in Mexico in the 1970s, and so it has a little bit of an 80s, cheesy feel to it. One of the great things about this movie is how it really does feel like a small town on the west coast of the US. That being said, there is a little more of a "proletariat" feel here than in the earlier "The Magnificent Seven," so it would be fair to call this a "working class" movie, albeit with all the Hollywood trappings. But all that said, I just really like the movie! It is not just the good acting, but how it brings together all the parts of the cast into a truly wonderful ensemble movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just watched the excellent John Carpenter horror classic The Thing, and was a very happy camper. The film is a classic, both story and visuals are just stunning. This film is easily one of the best movies of all time. It has been said, that it is a horror film for the 1990's and that it manages to be scary as hell, without sacrificing a thing in the way of style. The Thing   stands out among its peers as an excellent film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to say the movie made me laugh for a good hour. The script really captured the funny antics that we see from all our comedians.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the more memorable of the 70s movies, this time directed by a German, Wolfgang Petersen. The film is set at a summer camp for children with autism. There are several scenes of extreme cruelty and torture. Not a single adult in the film is even remotely human.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best part about this film is that it doesn't feel pretentious at all. The plot is very simple, and the actors are great, and there isn't a bad part. It's got a lot of heart. I don't know whether they put this in because they wanted to make a nice little movie in a small village, but I'm happy they did. I have yet to see a more thoughtful, respectful and compassionate movie about war, or about one of the most terrifying things of all, and that's probably just fine for a movie about soldiers who are fighting for the rest of their lives.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I heard that I needed to watch this I was so skeptical. Then I watched it a couple of times, and it actually improved the movie. It's not so bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the only movie I have seen where a good actor and good director are able to make a bad movie good. As far as I am concerned, there is nothing bad in any of the parts of this movie. The acting is fine, the script is good, the humor is good. Some parts of the comedy are so good that you will never laugh at another movie again. The other good points in this are the action scenes, the special effects and the music. What a good ending to the year. - July 30, 2013The Best Movie of 2014
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie in theaters and it was the first time I heard the name "The Big Lebowski" and not one person around me could make me recognize it at all. The entire movie is basically one long gag involving several characters and one joke in the very beginning that doesn't get a big enough laugh to carry the movie. I'm not even sure if they ever thought to name the film that or not. This is just a pretty dull, uneventful movie. It's not even a bad movie, but it's not much of a movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie. It will make you laugh and cry a little bit. It's very funny and sad at the same time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I first saw the film in a movie theater when I was 14. I was in the theater with two other boys. There was a young woman in the middle aisle. Her face was completely covered by black paint and her hair was up on her neck. She was wearing a large black top with a large heart on it. I remember her being very attractive and having a really big butt.   She would walk right in front of the theater while we were watching the movie. I don't think she was very good-looking.  I don no know why I liked her so much. I also remember my cousin asking me to help put her makeup on. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie. It's really not the kind of movie I would have watched. It is really quite a different movie from all the others I've seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't even need to watch the movie to know what a beautiful and memorable movie it is. I've seen it a couple times and I really enjoy it every time. I'm also a big fan of the comic book characters who are the focus of it all. If that weren't enough, the soundtrack is also very good, something I've always enjoyed.  A movie that anyone who cares to watch it, should at least watch the whole thing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was going to say something positive about this movie, but then I realized that I never gave it a good review. I like to get excited about movies, and this was definitely one of the better ones I've seen recently. There was plenty of action, romance, and humor going on. The story was not great (I never understand people who are too busy thinking about how a movie could be improved to get a good one), but it wasn't bad either. This movie was definitely a good buy for the price of a movie ticket.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The idea of a "tentacle monster" is awesome. In this film, the creature starts out as a cute little baby, but as the plot advances he grows larger and more dangerous until he transforms into the titular Tentacle Monster, a monster that has only one purpose: to devour the human race. The story is a bit simple and simple characters tend to get annoying, but for a tentacle monster this is a pretty cool concept and it gets a tad more intriguing with each scene added to it. It seems like a typical action movie, but there is a certain charm about it that is very hard to pinpoint.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent example of why the "B" films should be considered a whole new genre.  The writing is first rate, the acting is second to none, the production values are all right, the concept is original, and the special effects are good.    This is an A for sure.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the first good movies I've seen. I have always loved this film. I think, and I also hope, that, somehow, this film will be seen on the big screen at some point. I'm still looking forward to seeing it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A simple and well-acted movie about a man who runs around a small town in the 1950s in search of his wife. He gets more than he bargains for (or deserves, I think.) This guy has a good heart, but one that is often in jeopardy during the film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I know many people who didn't like the first X-Men movie or the second. I didn't too, but I do like this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen this film four times.  It's a classic film, a comedy in a campy '50s setting, the kind of movie you could watch on a lazy weekend afternoon and wonder if anyone had ever made a better movie.  It is a film that should have been shot on Super 8.  If there is one thing in which my wife and I disagree with each other, it is on the subject of campiness.  Sure, you could have made a really good comedy on Super-8.  But the whole point of this film is that you can make a really bad film on Super 16.    So, that's what you get when you make a "Campy Comedy".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To all the fans of my earlier horror movies, you can expect that this will be another great one! If you liked the old ones, you will love this! The story starts with a young man's suicide, and the aftermath that ensues. That young man is, as it turns out, not only a murderer, he's also a serial killer! We follow him as he kidnaps, rapes, and mutilates his victims before committing suicide to escape the bad luck of his childhood. This story may not be as well known as some of the others that I mention (and I haven't seen all of them, but I'm sure it exists), but I can't think of a better film for a young boy or a young lady. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What I really like about a movie like this is that it makes me laugh at how much of a nutcase we have these people.   When a little boy in his underwear discovers an old, old-style typewriter that has been used to write the works of Shakespeare, he is given the opportunity to play the part of "Hamlet" and then is sent off to a boarding school for the gifted.  The problem is that the school is run by a lunatic named Father Gellert (played by Max von Sydow).  He is a bad man who only wants to indoctrinate the students with his beliefs and is obsessed with making sure that they are illiterate.  Gellart is a real jerk and is very fond of throwing things at students, which seems to have had some kind of impact on the little boy.  When he learns of the fact that the little lad is going to be the best friend of his "lunatic" brother Mr. Gellarts (played with equal parts of madness and tenderness by James Coburn) he is infuriated and sets out to get him out of there.  He goes to the school to make sure that the boy doesn't get off and when he gets there the son of the school owner (William Campbell) gives him the opportunity for a prank.  This is when the boy first realizes that the typewriter is much more than a simple writing machine.  From this point on, the boy is forced to deal with Father Geller and to find ways to overcome the madness that he seems to be experiencing.  There is only one problem with this film that I didn't like:  I hate the musical numbers.  I find them to be annoying and annoying.  One of the musicals that plays in the film is a very good one that makes me think of a lot of things that I haven't wanted to think about.  To say that I loved the movie would be a massive understatement.  So what are you waiting for?  The Film Room

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "Alien" (1982)  was a sci-fi movie set in a future where the species of the Xenomorphs were wiped out in a nuclear holocaust. We are not given a lot of information about this, nor can we, and its a real disappointment. Most of the effects in the movie were quite mediocre, and the film has some good action, but not much story.  There are some cool concept shots, but very little actual character development. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first part of this film is very good with decent effects but the film starts with a rather strange twist. The main character is an ex cop who suddenly wakes up one morning in a room with nothing in his hands, but a pair of strange shoes! So he runs across town with his new shoes to get some clues for the identity of his kidnapper, but this is where the film takes an extremely dark turn. The kidnapper is an extremely violent psychopath, who wants to have the main character murdered. A few moments later his plan comes true when he beats him up and tortures him, and then has sex with him, but then he's taken away by a cop called Ron. Ron thinks this man is the killer but Ron is a bad cop, so he gets the killer, and sets out to find where he is hiding from the cop! But when he finds him he discovers this is one weird night at the cinema...   The second part of the film is much better than the first and it is also pretty good. It has a couple of more twists, is less violent than the last part and it also has a bit more action than the final part, however it all comes back around to Ron. This time however the villain is a woman called Rose who wants him to take off her skin and dress in red, because she loves the red (which of course he won't, because this is Britain). However it is not long until she makes the evil plans her plan and has him killed by Ron, because Ron is not a good cop. It is not until the final scene that you really wonder who the evil woman really is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is just a really good movie with a really bad ending.  I got the idea of it when watching The Dark Knight Rises and I thought that Bane would come on as the bad guy and he did for a while, then in the middle there is a flashback to when Bane was little.  And then Bane is born and he grows up to become a super villain who is pretty cool, but then he's kidnapped and tortured to death.  Then he is reborn as a baby and he is killed again, but he gets his revenge and becomes the ultimate bad guy.  But then the film ends and we learn that he is really the best bad guy ever.  The Dark Knights Rises was a good film and it had a good ending. It wasn't as good as The Dark Lord Rises but it wasn't bad either.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To the point of this review: This is by far my favorite zombie movie of all time. It's a simple concept- you have to stay alive long enough to kill the zombie that's been running all over town since it started. It has great pacing and the zombie scenes are really cool. Not many things you can do in a zombie movie and yet all of them are done right. The special effects are really great and the soundtrack is very cool. A good one to watch if you like zombie movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm giving this movie four stars because it's a beautiful piece of work. It has a strong cast including a good actress in Linda Hamilton as the lead actress, she is able to handle the leading part and she did a fine job. She was quite a bit older than I expected her to be (she was 60) and she had the right age to play this kind of a role. The film was shot on location on two continents, with a story line involving the end of the world and a woman with a secret. It is an original, well-told story with a sense of romance in it and a bit of comedy thrown in. All of the movie was quite well acted and the music was excellent. This movie is one of the best things that I've seen in the cinema in quite a while and I will definitely be going to see it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a true story about an ordinary father and his life changing relationship with a very special little girl. A little girl who is also a little girl - a little fairy in that fairy tale kind of way. Her father - who just so happens to be a real dork and a nerd.  And in this movie a lot of the dorkiness is the cause and not the cure.    If that weren't enough, they have an absolutely terrible, terrible, horrible director named Frank Oz.  There is something else I noticed while watching it.  When the movie gets on to the part where they are out to do some shopping, a very big, very scary truck (that we later see driving across the street in front of the store) drives by.  It looks exactly like the truck that they just saw, right down to the black rims.  What is it?   It's the real life version of "Mystery Machine" (and even though there was no way to make that film work, I still liked that movie a little too much).   And that is the end of the movie!   This is a great movie and a wonderful example of the "happy accidents" that occur when a few people meet and then work together.  Enjoy!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was fortunate enough to be in the city and surrounding area for a day trip from Washington to visit my Aunt. She and my uncle (my mom's brother) lived just north of the city near the University of Washington, where I graduated from high school in 1983.  In fact, my Aunt and Uncle lived on the same street as my Mom's Uncle's parents.  In the early 90's, when I was still in high school, my mom (who is now in her late 60's) would take me along for visits.   In fact, they lived right next door from my mom's uncle's parents in Bellevue.  I spent a few days there in the summer and was very impressed.  The city had changed a bit and things had improved.  After college I traveled back to the area to visit with my Aunt in Bellevues.  Now that I am back to Seattle, I decided to go down to the city again to visit her.  She was retired, living in a small house at the corner of 7th and Alder.  When I first saw her I was taken aback by the fact that she had an apartment.  However, after a brief tour of the house I realized it was my Aunt's little house.  For the next 15 minutes I sat and watched my Aunt while she did something she was very good at:  knitting.  My Aunt is a wonderful person.  There are no words to describe her. She is funny, kind, creative and very selfless.  Every time I see my Aunt, I feel like I have the good fortune to have her by my side.  Thank you Aunt! I don't usually get to post pictures, but this is a good one.  Not the most important picture in the world but something special just like my Aunt was.  This was a day out that my Mom and I took with my aunt.  It was to go to a museum.  At the museum we went to a gift shop that sold the original artwork from the first issue of The Amazing Spiderman.  Of course I bought the art.  Aunt gave me $15.00 when we left the museum.     My mom and I were going to go back to school, but she was too sick to attend.  We didn't tell anyone at our school except a few of our classmates and a couple of our friends at our college.   The next day we drove back to my
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought it was a bit much to tell the story of a man who tried to shoot a child with a paint-ball gun but the gun jammed so he decided to try another gun to see if it still worked. It did, which is why we find out that he shot the gun, didn't it?    The bad guy doesn't need a mask or a gun, he's got a big smile!   I hope that we'll see a few more episodes like this on the channel "Mighty Cartoon Network" but in my opinion, it didn't need to be a movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I said in my review of "The Devil and Daniel Webster," it was just as creepy as the story. This is an old-school horror movie, just like "The Conjuring," but less creepy and the film is actually pretty good. The movie starts out with a young girl (Julie Johnson) who goes missing after a party at her brother's house. She is found naked, her body mutilated, and her face and hands covered with cuts. When her sister shows up to find out what happened she finds a man, Daniel Webster (Mark Hamill), naked and screaming in agony. They immediately know something horrific has happened. Soon her family finds her body. They all know the same story: they were watching TV when something horrible happens to the children. When the kids are gone, someone starts cutting up young people. That person is Daniel Webster. This time, however, it is not his job to cut up people, he is simply watching and enjoying the show. He is a recluse who lives alone in a tree hollow. He comes out once a year to collect his leaves for medicinal use. He has an aversion to contact with people, and even the children at the party know this. During one of his visits, a young boy comes into the hollow and asks to see a little girl. He tells Daniel that the girl has a magic ring that makes people invisible. Daniel, not believing in magic, tries to tell the boy that it is all a trick. When a boy and girl get into the tree, Webster sees them and attacks them. The young girl runs away, and Webster starts to cut her into pieces. The girl manages to get away and gets help at a party. There, the girl is found with a knife stabbed through her heart. Daniel's only hope is to find the magic ring and destroy it. The film is based on the novel by Robert Bloch, who was famous as a prolific author. This film is very creepy and has some really interesting sets. The special effects were very good, especially the effects on Daniel's hands and face. He actually looks a little bit like a character from "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." The performances are a little weak, and there is nothing special about most of them. As a horror movie it is very good but as a romantic comedy I thought it was a little much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The third and last in a series of "Gods of Egypt" directed by Roman Polanski. Roman Polanksi made his living at being a director, and he is no longer doing so. He had his first serious flop with this one with the great reviews that everyone gave it, however the negative review was not for the film, but the poor performance by the three leading male characters. I guess that the actors all agreed that this was the best role they would ever play. The three leads have great chemistry with each other and a wonderful relationship with the two female leads. The only problem I had was the fact that the film ended a little too fast. Not all of the scenes worked, and in the end the film became kind of a dull film. I liked the first film better and the second film, it is a fine film, however it was not very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was a little confusing because there were so many different characters involved. If they'd kept it as a pure thriller, then the plot could have been much better. There was too much repetition of a theme in each scene. There's not enough action, and a lot of characters being killed off. It was the kind of movie that was too long for the story and it wasn't really a thriller either. I can only give a rating of 3 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has the same vibe as the old Rob Reiner films. It's got all the tropes and all the characters you would expect: arrogant and rich people and dour and miserable workers. The main character, played with the trademark smugness of an older Rob Reiners character, has to deal with being "outed" (by other people) as a drug-addicted loser. I'm not going to bother giving this movie a rating because it is so bland that it isn't worth your time: it is just an excuse to show you Reiner's smug, self-satisfied face. The first scene of the movie is pretty much a parody of all the other Rob Reineers films with the same characters, the same generic characters, and the same obnoxious "look what a nice man I am" mannerisms. But it is still funny. There are a few scenes that are actually really funny, such as the scene where the chief of police, played by the same person who played Bob Hope, has a breakdown in his office after realizing that his son is a cop and is not doing as good a job as Bob did. He shouts out the names of Reiner, Reinegar, Reinergar, and Reinerman and then breaks down again in tears. It is pretty funny, and when the police chief realizes that his life could be ruined by his drug problem it's pretty funny. A few minutes into the movie (probably the best part) a drunk is taken into the basement and has a nervous breakdown while Reiner looks on. Then you get the usual scenes of workers being jerks to their bosses and getting their jobs back if they will only do the work; or "doing their job" by doing a few pushups. There is also one very amusing part when Reiner and the young man working for him are discussing how much better the job he is doing is (he's going to be a "big star" just like Reiner!) and he tells him that his father is not much better and is only doing it "to get rich" because "his dad is a real rich guy." As the guy is about to have a breakdown over how much his father wants to be the biggest famous "actor" in the country (this is not a joke, he is making it quite clear that he means it) Reiner interrupts and says that his dad is just doing it for the fun. This is an appropriate response to a situation which is very
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a funny, and at times very touching movie about a very bad day. It is sad to see our heroes, who have been at war for decades, now have to spend time in a jail cell. They can't play the games they know so well and even the best of them don't think they can break out in a few days. But they have no time for this and are determined to get out of there. It all starts with the "funniest" scene I have ever seen. I mean come on, they are all very serious!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't expect to like this movie and I probably wouldn't have if I hadn't seen it in an off-hand remark on a blog. It's basically a modern fairy tale, with a twist: the princesses are not the good, kindhearted ones, but the evil witches and all sorts of wickedness.   (It's really not all that good.) But it's not a bad movie at all, and it does manage to be pretty good at things such as: Princess Alice and King Peter are the "good guys", and their daughter is the "baddest" one around. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a movie that should be on any fan of the genre. A high-tech, well-acted science fiction/horror movie.   A pretty standard story of a scientist who discovers the way to save a life from a dying planet, only he discovers that his body has gone to the same place and he is now dead.  There are many aspects of this movie worth discussing. First, the story is well-written. The writing is good and the plot is pretty straightforward. Even a young child would be able to follow the story. The plot is based on an old school science fiction book written in 1934. Although I didn't know it at the time, there are similar plots, such as the fact that the characters are forced to destroy each other. Second, the special effects are done very well. The alien planet in question, Planet Earth, is a pretty awesome place. Most of the scenes in this movie are really fun to watch.  A lot of people have said that this is a good horror movie. The special effects in this are good enough to make you feel like the character you are watching really has a good time.  One of the things about this movie that has always surprised me is that it is based off of an old book. The books were written when it was the height of science fiction. This movie is based in a much later time when science fiction is not nearly as sophisticated as it is today. It has not aged very well and that is something that is very impressive about this film. The performances are also top-notch.  I had only seen this a couple of times in the theater, but the movie never got old. It never got boring.  This movie has never been out of print and it is still very well-known today.  Overall, this is an excellent movie. It is very well made and does a good job of presenting a good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an excellent movie with all the ingredients.   It's not too violent, though it may have a few of those moments of shock that it so frequently indulges in.  The story is fun.  There is an amusing scene where a small boy plays the banjo to a young girl's tune which she hums.  It really isn't too bad.  And at the end, the old man says "Oh, you're back.  I thought I was going to forget you. "  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found the movie to be a good one, but for me it could have been so much better. The movie is a bit hard to understand (some dialog is so hard to get by, i.e. "you got a problem?  ") but otherwise it is quite interesting. I will have to come back to watch it again soon, because this is not a bad movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those films that's been waiting to be made for a long time.   It's a really clever film about time-travel, which I didn't know before seeing this movie.  A group of friends go to see a movie about time travel from the 1960s. The guy who plays the 'bad guy' is a genius. I would really like to see this on the big screen again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not sure about the movie, but I was entertained, even if it wasn't anything I haven't seen before.  That's not a bad thing by itself.    There was not a lot of dialogue in the movie and only a few moments of action.  Some of the actors could use a little more work, however, as they often seemed a little awkward and stiff.  I found myself wishing a different story was told and the ending made no sense.  The film was made as a tribute to the film "Shaft", which was a big hit in 1970.  If you haven't watched the film, you might as well start by watching that!  If nothing else, the film will teach you that a "star is just a star" and that a lot is at stake when a movie is made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was one of the funniest I have ever seen.   The plot is simple, but that does not make it boring; it is a simple story that the characters don't get a chance to get caught in their own fantasies.  The humor is not too over the top, but not as subtle as it could be.  I do not know whether the actors are good or not, but I am sure I will see them again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have a small crush on this movie, although I don't particularly want to do it (I have an 8-month-old daughter and can't be bothered to do anything that requires me to be present at the cinema), but it is an oddly beautiful movie with an extremely well-acted and thoroughly convincing cast. I don�t understand what people find so interesting about it though, the women are all pretty much the same, with one exception-an Irish widow who is very cold but at the same time very sweet and caring for her daughter. I guess it�s nice to have some mothers out there, though I donít get how that could possibly be considered interesting.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Towering skyscrapers, skyscraping men, skyscraper women.   And here's a good old-fashioned thriller.  I've long been on the lookout for something like this, and there's a decent amount of it in this one, the sort of movie I watch for the laugh lines.  But it doesn't really work for me; it is too easy and not very suspenseful, and I have no patience for such things.  The whole plot consists of a man who wants to know, in the most formal of ways, why he can never be able to make out a picture that has any of the characters on it.  There's something about this man who feels almost too good to be true.  As for the movie, it is pretty good, and has a very distinctive voice to match, but it doesn,t quite hit the high points that one would hope. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't think I was going to like this movie.  It looked like a typical Disney movie, and I really wanted to hate it.  I didn.    The first thing you should know is, this was made in the '40s.  This is not the Disney that you loved in the 1950s and 1960s. The look of it is reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz (though I think it has more in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas ) with cartoon people walking around and talking to each other.  It doesn't feel like the 1940s either.  I also noticed that there is little color.  The colors are bright, but there's little variation.  My only other complaint is that the music doesn't fit at all.  When the song "You're a Redneck, You're a Bad Ass" starts to play, it's a little too repetitive.  They also give out a "You've got mail" sign at the beginning of the movie, but it isn't shown again until the end.  All in all, if you're looking for a "badass" Disney movie with a big red cowboy and some talking animals, then you might enjoy this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was pretty much a Star Wars fan growing up. But when I saw the new trilogy, I was blown away. I still remember the first scene where Yoda explains the force to Luke Skywalker; it really felt like magic. I just remember going to the theaters, and loving every minute of it.  As a kid, I saw this movie over and over and I still love it. I think this is my favorite Star Wars movie to date. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know how many people will have seen this movie - I'm sure it has many, and it is one of those "so bad it's good" movies:  1.   It is basically just a big old fart doing a bunch of jokes about how much he sucks and then saying how much better he'd be if he wasn't a big fat gretchy loser, and how his name is "George." I don´t think that this makes much sense, it's like he has some kind of mental illness, I mean George would be the perfect name for a big dumb loser who makes a lot of money off of bad movies that nobody cares about. 2.  Now I'm no expert on bad movies, so if anyone can explain how this movie was made, please do! The film is simply a bunch a gormless losers trying to out-do each other with even more gormlessness. I think this has more in common with bad films in the '30s than it does with any modern movie. I mean if this is a movie, it ought to be a good one:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to admit, I had a few issues with this film. I don't want to say too much about the plot to keep spoilers for the movie out of this review.   This is my favorite film by the late Robert Altman. It's a brilliant blend of comedy, drama, and social commentary. It has everything you'd want in a Altman comedy: an amusing, self-deprecating, yet earnest narrator, a hilarious cast, a strong central performance from Warren Beatty, and a strong ensemble of supporting characters.  The film is written and directed by a master, and I have no doubt that this is the film that will make you think of Altman the writer and Altman, the director. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was an entertaining, quirky, hilarious, and fun movie about a group of young people who go on a camping trip to Canada.  We don't get much about what the camping is about or what our characters are doing.  Instead we follow the people and their families, each of whom is amusing and unique.  This movie is a blast and the actors are good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is the best. Very funny, very well written, very interesting. There's a scene where the two detectives have to run from a guy with a knife in his hand. The detective in the driver's seat tries to pull out of the alley. In the alley they realize they are being followed. They all get out of their cars. Then suddenly the guys in the other car follow them. They try to get away but the guy in the car follows. Finally one of them tries to ram the door with his car but the door opens so he has to get out. But the guy is too slow so he doesn't get away. This movie is a great example of how not to do a crime movie. The main problem is that the guy who is chasing them doesn't seem to be following the law. When he catches up to them it seems like he's going to do something but then he stops. It seems like the guy just doesn't want to get caught and he just keeps driving after the detectives. He finally does catch them but the detectives are out of it by the time they get in the back of the truck. This film isn't just a good crime movie however, it's also a good action film. The movie is very well-edited and it has a good cast. It's not much more than it needs to be but I'm not sure if the people who do the movie even realize it. It just seems like someone watched a lot of old movies and thought they would be fun to recreate. It certainly is fun to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In some ways, "Tully" and its sister film "Puss in Boots" share a number of similarities. Both films are set in a fictional village in the middle of England, both are very, very funny, both have strong female leads who don't take shit from anyone, and both share a central love story that is almost comically simplistic.  However, the similarities stop there.  It's like a little boy watching the old "Little Shop of Horrors" cartoons and saying, "Man, that was so cool!" And then, "How about 'Mulan'?!?"    And to the "Pussy Cat" that was the last thing he ever thought about.   If the first two films were about a village getting out of its muck, "PUSS IN BOOTS" is about two townsmen.  A local grocer who's been there a long time, and a local soldier who's come back home to see his family.  This film is the result of a lot of very, really good jokes, and also the same sort of clever and funny dialogue that you get in any number of "Sherlock" episodes.  If you haven't seen "Pulitzer's Quotable, Part One" or "The Aristocrats," you can definitely go do that.  Unfortunately, there isn't an actual punchline to any of these gags.  The funniest moment in the movie comes when Jack Nicholson says "I'm not saying this is the last time I'll ever do that movie!"   What really makes this movie special is the supporting cast.  There are no real characters.  All of the jokes are about how these two characters are different people, and that makes them great characters. This movie is hilarious even if you don't like the humor.  One of the more interesting jokes is when the two characters meet and fall in love.  Their conversation is like "I think I'm in love"   This movie has something in common with all the other "Buddy" films. It's a comedy with a plot.  When all is said and done, "BULLITT" is a very funny movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For a man like me who grew up in the seventies and eighties, this movie was the best thing I've ever seen and probably the best film that ever was made!  And one has to give the man credit:    What is it about this film that makes it so wonderful?   It tells the story of an elderly man (Bruce Willis) who runs a country club.  He is a "man of the people" and the film is all about how the "people" are being treated by this "man" of their own making.   The story is quite simple.  Willis' character is a man of "the old school" and he has made a "good living" from golf and hunting.  The golf course, that the old man owns, is run by an old man who has lost his mind.  His son, who is played by Bruce Willis, is the new man in town.   The golfers (in the original script) were made out of straw.  Then the old lady that is now a "gentleman of nature" makes her appearance.  This lady (Susan O'Brien) is quite an attractive woman, but not exactly like the one in the original.  Now the story goes something like this:  1. The old man (Robert DeNiro) who ran the Country Club, is old, but he is still the most powerful man in the town. 2. The young golfers who are making a good living are the most "talented" people in the village. 3. The "gentler" men are also enjoying some "special" pleasures. 4.  Bruce Willis' first acting assignment: playing a "young, rich" man that is having a problem with a "beautiful lady" and a "wild" wild animal.  So this is how it began.  A good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   You won't see a character with any depth or complexity in any of these films:  The only interesting character in the first one (  I actually liked this one more than the other two), is the one whose mother is being brutally beaten and tortured in prison - she is a pretty little red head who gets involved in the torture of her tortured mother.    I enjoyed this movie more than my other two films because it is so bizarre.  I also like the fact that these films are all about the same basic problem - if a man has to live a double life, you can be sure that he has not lived an ideal one either.  A lot of the films have some funny moments, but nothing that keeps me interested.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a bit of a wannabe punk when I was growing up. I did my bit in the early 1980s punk rock scene in London, where a lot of people got killed or were in prison. My father was an air steward for the BBC, so when I got into the music scene in the 1980s and started writing my own songs, I thought it was the best thing ever!   After finishing up a college degree in film, I moved to LA to study film.   In 1987, I was asked to do some music videos, which were a great experience and something I enjoyed.  I started a career as a music video director in Los Angeles with people like John Belushi, Rob Lowe, Eddie Murphy, Chris Farley, Eddie and the Cruisers, and a couple of others, and it was at this time that I met my first wife and daughter (my daughter is now about 20, so she is a real grown up and I miss her a lot!).   And so it all began.  What is it like to be a rock star?  The rock star has many things to deal with and a very short leash.  First of all, they're usually very handsome.  And not everyone in the band loves the way you look!  They're usually not the best singers (if you could tell them any other way...) and often have problems in finding people that are talented to fill the time they spend working.  There are also a lot more people looking to get in on the action.  Rock stars will find a way to do it.  They have a lot to look after.  A good rock star will try to be someone they can trust and will try and show that they love their kids.  But as all good rock stars must have noticed, some people will always find a reason to get ahold of you.  Some will do it for free and others are looking for more money.  For me it was a combination of these factors.  In fact it's not a problem for most of the people in my band.  Sometimes I'll give some of these people more money or take a cut of the music video money (which is often from one of the artists).  It was a bad decision for my wife and her family. I'm very sorry about that.  It's not the end of rock and roll though!  It just meant that I had to leave my wife,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a movie with a bad name, yet a great one. It's the first film I saw by British director and writer George Miller, and this one is one of his better efforts. You could argue that the film is a sequel to his previous film, but it's not. What you really have here is a story about an ordinary American boy who gets dragged into a very special world. You see, when our American hero, Jake Epping, goes on a holiday in a small town in Wales called Bridgend (population 200), he's attacked by a man with a huge, red face! The man is in fact the demon of the fairies, known as Puck. Epping escapes the demon's possession, and the local women fall for him. Unfortunately the locals soon discover he's not the only guy who can change into a giant red face at a moment's notice. The town quickly falls into disarray, so Epping decides to go back to America. He does this on a boat, and in the process of his journey comes across a young boy named Jake who has an uncanny resemblance to him. He goes back to the young boy and helps him get over the pain he feels because he was changed into a small boy when he was younger.   I've not seen a lot of movies that have been made by people who have never actually made a movie before. One of them is George Miller who was born in England and lives in Canada.  He has been a film maker from his early childhood, and has made over forty films. This is his first film.  I'd never seen a good looking movie starring a man who is not particularly good looking, and he looks much better here.  George Miller is an incredibly talented person and he gets to show off in his very first film that very skill with which he directs.  There is something very satisfying about watching a man put together a set of moves that move and move again, and there is no doubt that Miller has a wonderful vision of what he wants for this movie.  The story is well told and the characters are all well developed, with little details to help them along.  This is definitely one of the better films made by Miller.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I mentioned in my review of this film, the best thing about it is that it's one part sci-fi, one part horror, and one part action comedy. It's actually one of the only films I've seen that has all three elements in it, and that's a rarity among movies.   With "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" the directors have found a way to do a version of The Wizard of Oz (the movie that's being parodied here), the "Funny How Love Goes" video, The Wizard Of Oz, The Muppet Show, etc. in the same frame.  One of the key things about Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless World is that there is nothing pretentious or pretentious about it.  It's a movie about the relationship between two men and how their friendship and romance changes them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen the Star Wars prequels, but I have heard and read about the plot - the evil Emperor Palpatine kidnaps a young boy with an unusual name - and then proceeds to send his assassin droids out to murder his family members. He then gets rid of the boy, who's now a boy again, and has him sent off into the galaxy. That's it.  Now, that's far from a good plot.   The idea isn't bad at all, but it isn't really well executed.  The movie doesn't really give us an adequate explanation of who Darth Vader is.  In the original movies he's a Jedi who was killed at the end of Return of the Jedi by Anakin, who was a Jedi at that time too.  Now, how would Vader lose his lightsaber at the hands of an innocent boy?  And why couldn't he kill a droid with a saber?  That's all.  Not to mention a large part of the movie involves Vader trying to murder everyone in his family, because he's afraid that the Emperor is going to come back and kill them and then he'll be stuck.  And then he meets his own wife in a restaurant.  Oh, and it turns out he's married to another woman.  There is just so much wrong with this plot that the movie is completely unreadable for anyone who was actually interested in a Star Wars movie and was able to sit through more than half the movie, let alone all of the prequel stuff.  A movie like this is one of the few movies from the Star Trek era which still stands up today.  It is not a good Star Wars film, in fact it's probably one of my favorite Star Wars films, but there is one thing about it that I don't really like - the music.  I think that the music is just too much for even the most adventurous audience.  My problem with it is that it is just repetitive.  First there are all these songs about the Force.  Then there are these allusion songs about a galaxy far far away and how great it all is.   Then, after the Death Star blows up - there's the one about how they won't miss the Force, or the Force won't be missed.  Next, the one where the evil emperor is really evil and the bad guys are really bad.  Finally, there's all these cool themes about how
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is what the French language has been reduced to - a pile of idioms. It is not just that 'in the beginning God created heaven and earth' is an idiomatic expression of the common French belief that the world was first created in the Big Bang. It's that a good many French actors don't know how to express themselves. Most of them have no clue that they are acting, and are at least as bad as the ones in most Western films. At least in this case, when an American filmmaker is directing a French production, you get a pretty good film. It shows no sign of the cynicism or self-pity which infects most of the French films which are imported into this country. It is interesting to note that this is the only movie in which a French policeman is not a policeman. The police are always French and have to behave in French. And all their other characters have to speak French too. That is very unusual. They're quite an unusual people in many ways.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't want to go into this one. I really didn't. It was pretty darn creepy. The movie itself is very, very unsettling. The film begins with a girl named Claire (Nicole Kidman) visiting a hospital where her aunt (Marilyn Monroe) works. She is accompanied by two female friends who, in addition to having the unfortunate nickname of the "Little Rascals," wear bright pink lipstick and pink high heels. They get to visit the doctor and nurse for their ailments and they are very sick. They are told to try to make the most of their time. The doctor says that they won't leave until they get a prescription for a new "treat" called "Empathy Spray." Claire and her friends go through the list of possible uses for the spray. It has not a lot of uses other than getting them a little high or giggly. One of the nurses gets an unexpected taste and starts to get very nervous. She tells Claire she needs help getting it off. She grabs a pen and a little tube and starts sucking. She then takes a large red feather, breaks it in half and puts it on the side of her nose. The nurse goes to try the spray and sees the feather. The feather floats in the spray then it gets stuck in the nurse's hair. The bird escapes and then floats across the room where it gets lodged in a dresser. The next morning the nurse goes back to see what happened to her hair but there is a hole in the dresser and it is gone. Her friend is very upset and Claire says she needs the "Effort Spray." It is a simple spray that has a small red feather stuck in one end. The other end has a little red bead stuck in it. Claire and the nurses go to find the feather that fits. When they get to the dressers door Claire hears a noise. It is the bird. It flies over the dress. The nurses start to laugh and Claire gets more upset but the nurse puts the feather back and tries to give it to Claire. When she tries to put it back in the feather doesn't fit in the bottle. The girls try to do the bottle up until a red liquid comes out of it. It's a "Tear Jelly." Claire tears it up and takes it to her aunt. The aunt tries to make her feel better. It doesn't do her any good. Eventually the nurse tells Claire to call the doctor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this movie everyone seems to be having fun, including the hero.    The movie is about a boy whose family moves away and he moves in with his aunt.  When the boy doesn't show up for dinner, his aunt decides to look for him.  The boy is eventually found, but it turns out that he is a runaway.  In order to catch this runaway, he must go on a wild ride.  It seems that his aunt doesn't like him. When the movie is over, I didn't know what to think about the movie or the boy.  To me it seems that the boy is a bit selfish and not to interested in things around the house and around the school.  I didn?t really like this movie at all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A lot of film historians and critics have been saying this movie is probably one of the greatest of all time, and that's saying a lot. I'll admit that I was somewhat skeptical about the whole thing in the beginning, but by the end, I was convinced this film could rival anything else made in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s.  The picture was filmed in Mexico by a couple of young Mexican filmmakers, with a cast that included a former boxer named Juan Francisco Escalante, a former circus performer called Pedro Alcantara, and a few more Mexican celebrities. The movie took about three years to complete, and it shows. It's so beautiful, so romantic, so wonderful. It gives you the sense of a lost world, a land untouched by outside forces and cultures. It feels like a dream, as if the story is an allegory for the Spanish conquest in South America. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The fact that this movie exists is a triumph of the imagination of the film's director, James L. Brooks. I mean, seriously. Brooks takes a comic world and turns it into a dark, macabre, and highly violent work. The acting is decent, though the actors don't exactly stand out and the script is pretty straightforward.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I did not expect this movie to work as well as it did and, as a film, it is well worth it. The music was a perfect match for this film, and when the song "Sister" ended, the audience was totally spellbound and the film ended with a bang.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Well, it's not a good Hollywood movie but the plot of the movie was good: young lovers having a nice time with all the best Hollywood stars. There's not much to say about the plot. But it's great to see Hollywood stars in the big-time again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The idea that a group of misfit teens are forced to play a game, and survive, was always a good one. This movie doesn't give it the love and reverence it deserves. The acting in this film is atrocious. The story is also pretty boring, though that is to be expected.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are a few very good sci-fi movies coming out in 2013, but they are a little thin for me (more like a movie about sci-Fi). "Innerspace" is a fantastic science fiction film by Philip K. Dick, and it does some excellent stuff. It is a fairly simple story about a crew in a spaceship (like "Inner Space") on a mission to find the source of a mysterious radiation that affects the crew on all their different ships. The ship is being pursued by a very small ship (like a submarine) that can also fire torpedoes. The crew and their ship have been captured by the small ship in a submersible. The movie is well paced, and is an excellent example of Dick's ideas about space travel. There are all sorts of ideas in here, and I liked the way that the movie explored all of them. It's a great film, and a really entertaining watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's always nice to see a film made by a French-Canadian director, even in the 1970s.   The film isn't a big success by any means - not because of the movie but because of what it stands for.  A small boy lives in a small village in the French-Pays-Cotonac valley (the "Valley of the Moon").  He's always on the move, always on his own, and always surrounded by violence and chaos.  He sees a few friends on the same day and spends the afternoon hanging out, playing hide and seek, with little success.  When he's finally in the village proper for the evening, the villagers, who've been watching him on TV for days, come after him with knives, clubs and axes.  It all comes to a head, as they're getting ready to assault him and a few others, with everyone watching.  This movie really is about the children in the Valley.  As for the adults, they're the most fascinating characters I've ever seen.  They seem so innocent in comparison to the chaos of the valley.  One of my favorite parts of the film is when they try to run away.  We can hear them shouting as they run.  "No! No! No!"  Then suddenly... "Papier moi!"    And there are more shouts as they start to get the heck out of the village.  The entire scene is filled with just such childlike joy.  These characters are a joy to watch.  And, even more amazing than that, in this film, they never take themselves too seriously.  There are even some really good jokes, like the time that this little boy and his dog play hide-and-seek.  That little boy is in love with this dog.  (Note: This is from a French release of the American film.)

It's a good look at the people who live in the old west, and the adventures they went on. If you don't know it, you will after this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this movie. The concept is great and there is enough action to keep it interesting. The way the actors play their parts is excellent and the film does an excellent job of depicting the human tragedy at a camp for escaped WWII soldiers in the middle of winter. If you are looking for something to laugh at then look no further.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In any other year, this would have been a great summer film. It wasn't, but it was an improvement from the first movie, which was also about a group of people trying to stay together in a post-apocalyptic world.   The people at the start of both films were much more likable than the characters of The Road   and The Hunger Games.  I mean, they all tried to help the kids out, they were just as confused as anyone and their efforts were more than a bit futile.  This film, the sequel, added to the film rather than detracting from it, and the plot itself was somewhat better than that of the first one.  The story itself has a few flaws, one of which is the character of the leader of the group: Peter, played by Christopher Walken. In the first film, Walken's character was much more of an eccentric than an all-American hero: he was more like an alien with a penchant for drinking too much.  In this movie, Walkening plays a very different kind of character. He isn't nearly as likable, however, he is an interesting character and it is hard to look away from the movie.  There is also a new villain, played in this movie by Danny DeVito, and another new character, played (at least in part) by John Malkovich, who has an interesting role.  It is hard, though, not to be a little disappointed when there is a scene at the end of the movie involving a car, a boat, a jet ski and a truck in what seems to be only a few days time.  Sure, the movie could have ended about 10 minutes earlier, but for that one moment, it felt like they were going to wrap up a story they began.  After that, I'm not sure I'll ever get tired of the original film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me, a truly great movie is one where you see the world through the eyes of a person who doesn't really understand what he is seeing. That said, the performances here are all very strong. Michael Caine and Sir Laurence Olivier are both wonderful, as is Laurence Harvey and Richard Burton. There are a few problems. First, it is a little hard to believe that the actors are only 50 years old. Second, the ending is hard to swallow. For my money, Burton should win an Oscar.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been in a movie theater for a long time and this time was no exception. This is an old-fashioned tale about the end of civilization as we know it and how it is brought back to life. A lot of things were old to the bone: the government, a very primitive technology, poverty (not a lot to get, but a lot, and it's all on you) and a few men from the future who have no understanding of the modern world. A pretty typical story about time traveling in the way that some people are fascinated by. However, there is another element that makes it much different. This was a story about a man who is a genius, who knows a lot about what's going on, why things are happening, why there are so many disasters happening now, and the reasons that people are so fascinated with the time travel. It is so interesting that I can't help but wonder about the future we may be headed toward.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To get a taste of the classic  Lassie  movie you don't need to pay anything but do yourself a favor and see Lassiette! This is a story of a girl who has lost a puppy, she finds out it is the same dog that was left behind when the owner died of a heart attack, when he died he left the dog with his daughter to look after. The girl is a good girl but has trouble with her feelings. So the boy finds the dog and takes him home. It gets hot but Lassette is not interested in the boy. He wants to have the dog back so he decides to go to the pet store to get another dog to replace Lasse. The owner is not happy to see the boy come to the store because the boy has not paid him for a year. But the boy is desperate. He goes to the owner who says he has a few bucks left and asks the boy if he wants another dog as he has already been given a new dog and she does not like it. The dog that has died is brought back to life. The boy tells the owner it will not be so easy to replace the same guy that has already given the girl two dogs and wants to get rid of the girl. The only problem is Lassoette does not know who the boy was and does not want to know, the owner tells the girl to go get Lassi the dog. The next morning the dog returns with Lassiotte looking as if she had just been to a funeral. When the girl finds out what is going on she is furious and says that she would rather have a dog that she can love. The pet store owner tells her not to be so hasty. But Lassotte cannot be found again. When Lassosette returns the owner says "she is only a dog, she has no feelings but has a good memory and knows everything about everything" He tells the boy she must return to the Pet Store as she will not take any responsibility and the owner will be the only one who will be blamed. So Lassolesste goes back to the Store and starts crying the owner then tells her to take a bath. So they all have a great bath together then head over to the front door. There is no sign of Lassolete and the shop keeper says she has probably taken off for the countryside, she just walks in the shop. The store manager
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the better thrillers on the market right now, featuring a story that could have easily been lifted from a pulp film: a gang of thugs, a beautiful beauty, and a very nasty, very twisted cop.  The movie is set in a little town called Tumbleweel, Oregon, and it is ruled by a local sheriff named John F. Kennedy (played by Johnny Depp).  Kennedy has long wanted to take down the local mob; however, when a corrupt state senator hires a group of criminals to go on a kidnapping spree, Kennedy finds himself involved in a plot to kill F.D. Kennedy's beloved daughter, Sarah.  While the film is set primarily in the town of Tumblewell, the movie manages to incorporate the area around the small town into the plot in a couple of ways.   First of all, the action is excellent.  Most thrillers seem to lack the kind of good action scenes that are required in order for them to be considered suspenseful and exciting.  There are several shots of the mob hitting the streets, and they are always memorable.  But in addition to the scenes of the cops and the mob fighting, we get several good looks at the locals.  Some of them are charmingly ridiculous, and you are tempted to laugh at them.    The town itself is a fairly small place; so much so, that its population is actually only about a hundred people.  It is interesting that this town was built on top of an old timber mill; it's apparent that the mill had to be torn down, and the town built on the remains.  A lot of people seem to have been killed during the construction of the town, and some of the people who die are never mentioned again in the story.  As the plot progresses, you are drawn deeper into the story; you will eventually find yourself in the middle of a violent shootout, and then you will find yourself watching Kennedy's family members being murdered.  Despite the violence in the film, the actors in the movie are all good, and I really enjoyed it.  This is a very good, entertaining movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first heard about this documentary while surfing the Internet. I saw a brief trailer at the time, but only saw a bit of the film, and even then was not able to get enough out of the screen.  I am not ashamed to admit that I have never seen a more brilliant, well-made and exciting film.   This is the perfect example of the power of the Hollywood magic. The film tells of the great American story - the life, times and stories of the most successful movie stars in the history of cinema.  With the help of a very special guest:  It is clear from the trailers that the subject matter is more political, political and social commentary. The documentary is not only about the stars of Hollywood's golden age, but about the lives and careers of their family members and the role of the cinema in society.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a fun movie that did a good job of exploring the idea that there really was a great deal of evil going on in the world of television. The movie is a bit slow but the suspense is there all the way from the beginning until the end, which brings us to one of the few flaws I have with it. After a few scenes of fun, the movie takes off in the direction of horror. This is not a great movie and I would not have recommended it. I know that it may be the only good movie about television so the people that made this movie may not be as good as they thought.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film was the first time in my life that I saw an animated cartoon, and I can still remember that it felt like a cartoon. The graphics were simple and the characters were very simple. My favorite thing about this film was that you never got a full blown battle, just a few simple characters going about their business.    Cinema:     If you're looking for an easy way to pass the day or a nice day at the movies, you don't need to look any further than the Warner Brother movie called "The Wizard of Oz". This is a story about Dorothy, a little girl who is sent into the fantastic land of Oz where she learns about Dorothy's true identity and about a mysterious man named Scarecrow.  This was a fun animated cartoon that was made in 1937, and it is still very much alive today. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one is a great little movie, like a good story with good characters.    You may wonder why I picked this up over all the other bad movies I've seen lately.  Well, I like a bit of mystery and mystery has it.  It's set in the near future, and there are plenty of people out there that are a bit off.  They have an ex-cop that doesn't like people.   A little girl, whose mother is the head of the local crime-fighting squad.  A couple of young kids, who are very different from the norm, and the cop and his wife, who like to party.  And the killer, who is not at all like the usual killer.  I haven't seen the movies too many times now, so I don't really know the story too well.  What I know is that it's very well acted.  There is also a really great soundtrack.  (Note: If you're wondering about the original song, it was "In a Different Place" by Elton John.)  The movie also has a few great "dream sequences", where the kids see things that are not quite right in this very near future.  Like the kids trying to ride a bike when the policeman tells them that they can't.   Then the cop goes out for a drink and the kids fall off the bike and into the water.  This is pretty much all I remember from the movie, because I was still in a good mood the next morning when I woke up to the news that the killer is now the head cop of a small town.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In his own way, director John Carpenter presents a fascinating and well-crafted story, though it can be somewhat confusing (although not quite as confusing as one might think in an age of modern CGI). The ending, the ending of sorts, is also a tad too neat, but if this was a movie about aliens who were not quite human, it would not be an especially strong case for humanity.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I should give a little bit of warning. This movie is a classic. I haven't seen a better movie, the only things that have changed are the characters. In the 70's, they were not in the best shape. They were on drugs. They just wanted to go through the motions. I could not tell if they were in a bad dream or just drunk, but it was clear that they wanted to keep on doing it. The movie opens on two women going out with their boyfriends. They are pretty hot. There are other guys out and about as well. The first guy, who comes up to them is the same guy who raped them. This guy's name is Frank and he does all the bad stuff. He says he's the son of a famous doctor. He has a lot of money and some nice girls, but he just wants this one girl. He puts a gun to her head and says she's the only one that he wants. The guy who has the gun asks her out. He's very cool about it and seems totally genuine. The others who come to the apartment are also pretty cool guys. The only one who acts like a jerk is the old man who lives upstairs. It's kind of like The Godfather where you're really getting to know the gangster who's on the run.   The movie really starts to pick up toward the end. Frank makes one last pass with the gun. There is a shot of the old lady running out of the bathroom. She's dead. She was shot in the back and it was really quick. She had to have been there to see that. At that point, Frank decides to go to the house. The house is a small house on a cul-de-sac in a little town. There's a lot going on in the house: one side of the house is set up with an old couch and a fireplace and on the other side of it is a bedroom. The camera pans over to a man in the kitchen who is cooking up some kind of meal.  , it all comes together in a nice little flashback. She is standing in front of the camera and Frank says to her, "I think you're beautiful." and he walks up to her and puts his arm around her. As she is giving him a hug, the old woman comes out of another room. She looks at her back. The old lady is Frank's mother. She has a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In my opinion, the best movie of this series.  It is more of a sequel than a prequel to the first movie, and the plot is similar.    But the humor, characters and plot is even more clever and funny, and it will probably leave you wanting more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those classic '70s science-fiction movies that the young-at-the-time were more excited to see than anyone else: a space opera set entirely on the Moon. It was a little dated when it came out, in the mid-1970s, but it never lost its cool. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's an excellent movie. One of the best movies made in the seventies. I'll be watching it a few more times. There's a part in it where the movie is about a guy from the south who goes to the big city and has to go through the motions. The movie then shifts to the southern city where there's a lot of fun. I'm glad to see a movie that is funny but isn't preachy. It's the movie they should have made when they made the south famous.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this movie there is a certain 'tolerance' to be had. I'd suggest watching this film in the evening with your favorite beverage while you and your family relax and enjoy each other's company (or maybe just relax and watch some movies with your family - what the hell is wrong with you people??!) and think about how wonderful life is. If life is this great, why are there so many unhappy people in it?
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is about a college kid (John Cusack) who, while on a camping trip, ends up having to stay with his Uncle for the night.  They come across a little girl (Jennifer Hudson) and a man that is supposed to be their father.  The Uncle is a drunk.  I didn't know how far this guy goes so I wasn't sure it was going to be a nice thing to see.   As the evening went on, the Uncle begins to act more and more strange.  He tries to get John to make out with him (which, according to John, is totally unprofessional and gross) and he also tries to show him porn.  He even has a sex toy in the movie's opening.  Well, it's not a sex scene.  I mean, I'm all for seeing people have sex, but in a movie?   But I really liked the whole thing.  It was all a little weird and a little cute and I got a good chuckle out of it.  John and his Uncle are definitely a bad match-up and while I can't say that they did a terrible job together, the film wasn't quite a winner. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last film of       John Milius' " MASH " is a great one.   I have enjoyed many of    the John M. Miliuses films, they have  been very fun.  This is one of my all-time favorites:  There is   a   somewhat  weirdness   in   the   opening scene, the camera zooms out of the frame for a little bit then back in with a shot of the actors.  Then the next time the camera is back in the frame, the men are standing on the same block but the frame is different.  In   many   scenes you can hear the people talking in  their car.  They sound   different, I think they sound like  the  people in a horror movie from the 90's.  The acting is  funny and some of the  scenes just make you laugh:  The best line   from a character is when  he asks the guys "Did you have to pay for this?"  The men in  Fido's car don't look at each other, they look at   each other.  It would be like if they were trying to drive along but the driver is looking at the ground or maybe looking through a window.  This is a good   classic that   is worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the second time I have seen a movie that I thought was a little strange. I had no idea the man playing the doctor was a "psychopath", and no idea he played the other two characters were "psychotics" either. So, what was this movie about? It was like a scene from "The Exorcist". And it really got a lot of laughs.    So, how is this movie?   I think, I don't think "Psycho" is a bad movie, but I do think it is not as good as they would have you believe. And yet it can get really good. The actors (all pretty good) and the director all know the meaning of the word "horrible" and work really hard to make you hate these characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a great comedy. It's funny all the way from start to end, with the characters (and the director!) making the movie fun and exciting, the story moving at a good pace, and the actors being funny and charming.

With over 700 movies being made per year, the quality of films has been steadily improving.   The quality of cinema is now high and there is a growing demand for more films in the cinemas.  If you like a good thriller with a twist,   watch a film from the 1960's.  It will surely satisfy.

They live together in their own cottage, have a bad reputation with their neighbors, a bully, a vampire, a werewolf, and a voodoo priestess.   The film begins in a very creepy way, with one of the characters saying that she will be home late that night. The next thing anyone knows she has disappeared.  The story of a bad girl's bad life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   As of early 2011, I've finished my first season of True Detective, which has turned out to be my favorite show of the season. This is not my favorite mystery series: that honor goes to The Killing , but this is a very good show with a good cast (especially Ray Wise) and a very exciting storyline.   The show's main problem is that the premise -- a young, hot cop named Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) is found murdered by a couple (played by Woody Harrelson and Michelle Pfeiffer) after a couple's car gets struck by a drunk driver, who is himself hit by a car (played, of course, by Woody).   That kind of premise doesn't last for long.  So far, the story has focused on the murder investigations, and it has taken an interesting turn in season two: the detectives are on the trail of the couple who murdered Cohle.  They are aided by a new cop (Nicolas Cage), and it's nice to see that McConaughy and Harreland are giving us a less cynical, more grounded version of the world we live in.  They've also got the good sense to avoid having the detective find himself solving the crimes of another cop.  The story is fairly predictable at the outset, but it's good that so little is kept secret from viewers: we'll be seeing all sorts of different kinds of evidence and suspects.  I'm enjoying it so far: Cohle is an interesting character, and his love for the women and his family is a welcome addition to the otherwise rather uninteresting story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not a big sci-fi fan. I think the only thing which impressed me was that the movie is "not a space opera with robots, but a classic movie which uses the genre to its best advantage. And by "classic movie", I don't mean "that old movie which the kids watch nowadays" but really original and a real classic.  I think that this movie is the first movie I have seen in which a spaceship travels at supersonic speeds and it just looks totally cool. This movie is a treat for any sci-Fi aficionado. I give it an 8 out of 10, which I feel is a very fair score.

It was not a particularly good movie, but it had a certain elegance about it which was a lot like The Last Of The Mohicans. I have never liked the movie so much, and I like it even more now that I realize that it was just a cheap Hollywood attempt at a Western, a good one, but a very bad one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is a real gem. It is not often you come across a film that is as close to being an autobiography as you could possibly get. The story of a young man who struggles with alcoholism while at the same time pursuing his true love and only true friendship. If you are looking for a good laugh then you will definitely be satisfied. It has a great soundtrack and the actors are perfect.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I'm going to the movies." "Oh, you aren't going to see a movie?" The director goes, "I'm a director. Oh yes, it's all very well to say, I'm not really into movies. But I like movies that look at everyday things, from a different perspective. Like how they are not just the stuff of fiction. Like when I went to school, and the books there all looked alike." It does not sound like the story is as bad as it is said to be. There is much of interest in it - it is certainly a good film, but that does not excuse the bad performance by the actor who plays the part of the director.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I was expecting to be blown away by this movie, but I wasn't. This movie has a lot of promise (I saw it with a great crowd), but there isn't a lot to say about it. If you like a good, classic old-school gangster flick, this is pretty good. If they can do a second one, I'm sure they could bring that much more to the table. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm still in shock that I watched this! So much was done so right in this film! Great action, excellent writing, wonderful music, lots of character development, excellent cinematography...   It is still the only James Bond film I've seen that is actually a good James Bond movie!   Even though I had to sit through the second half of the film twice to finish it, it still managed to keep my interest throughout.   And then in the finale... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was like the best of the good movies in the 80s. This is a movie that will stick in your head for years to come. It is so awesome that a lot of the times it seems like someone is making a movie out of it. It has one of the best soundtracks and the acting is as good as any film of the time. It also has one the coolest looking cars. A classic from the 80's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There were a couple of moments where I was worried that the film might have been cut, as there were several pauses where things weren't very clear. But, even though I found the story a bit hard to follow at times, it was still very suspenseful and I am very glad I watched it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the story of a couple in love and how their life changes when they are invited to stay in a castle during the Queen's Jubilee. It's a simple story but it's told so well I'm left wanting to see what happens next. And there you have it my friends! This is just one small, yet entertaining movie. So don't worry, you'll have more than enough to entertain you for a few hours.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a solid story about a man and a woman in love. It's one of those films that's really good and kind of depressing and yet there is a very good message behind the film: "Life is short, love is forever."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only complaint I have about this is that all of the actors seemed really bored while in the scene where they meet, they were all standing still and none of them had any charisma. So, to give a good acting performance I would suggest having a great stunt double for all the guys and actresses and not letting them talk at all while they are walking and moving from scene to scene. Other than that good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the first time that I had the privilege of watching a movie from the "G.I. Joe" movies. They didn't have that much to show about the G.I Joe characters and I think it's a little disappointing that the movie didn't offer that much about the actual action in the movies. We are in World War Two and Joe, played by Peter Weller, is a German pilot. He is stationed with another squad on a desert island when a plane crashes onto the island and they discover a bomb. This doesn't prove anything about the movie though because we never see where the bomb actually lands. The rest of the movie is the adventures of Joe, his girlfriend and other characters that are never really shown or have much character in the movie. That said, I think the movie was fun. The film opens with a good set piece as Joe and his girlfriend are about to parachute from a plane. Joe's girlfriend is thrown out of the plane, but Joe and the others don't realize that until it is too late. They parachute and land in a house that they don't recognize. They investigate and discover that there is something wrong with the house and the owner, Mr. Gold, is missing. The two Germans in the house don't know what to do so they go and ask the owners of the other two houses on the island, which are very similar to the house in the original story. Both houses have been taken over by Nazis and one of the Nazi women is holding a small boy in a room. The three of the owners have been working together, so they figure it must be the Nazis who took over the house that night. They go off to find out who did it. The movie is a nice action picture in which Joe doesn't get a lot of action, but the movie isn't boring. There is a lot to see here. Peter Wellers has really done an excellent job as Joe. He has this tough guy look that is quite scary. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie and loved all the characters. The movie is not about a young woman who gets a job to make a little money and does whatever she can to raise enough money so that she can buy a house so she can raise a son who she wants to have like her. It is about a woman who goes down to the very bottom. This is about an old lady who goes to New Orleans when she is not able to afford a house. This was a very old fashioned movie. It tells the story of an old woman trying to keep up with the men who are getting rich and famous. All her friends have died of cancer, she has only a few dollars in her pension and she has to go down to New York in an old wagon to sell some of her photographs because her husband is a musician who was very rich in the days of the Jazz. The old woman gets all the money she needs to be able to be taken out to the clubs where her husband plays and to the dances, but she is no match for the world. It was just an old fashioned film from start to finish. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't seen this before, so I'm curious to see if it has any meaning in relation to the movie.   The first time I saw this was in the mid 1970s at the age of 5, and I was immediately mesmerized by this little movie about a couple of guys who go out to see a movie and run in to a problem, where a policeman shows up and kills the boys.  There were some good dialogues throughout, and they don't try to hide it.  It was a little scary, and made me smile a little.  I was always curious to know who made this movie, and finally, it turns out it was made by Steven Spielberg himself.  This movie is really cool, and the concept of a man coming out of a movie theater, then being killed in a mysterious fashion by a policeman is really awesome. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The book follows a group of characters, a father and sons, a husband and wife, a young family, and their friends and neighbors. They all seem to be getting along rather well except one person: David. David is a man of the cloth who wears a white dress and makes many women laugh. David has a crush on a teenage girl, Emily (who seems to fall for David, too). Emily has many boyfriends, but none is the man David wants. David, Emily, and the rest of the family are also on the run. There's also a woman who is being followed by David. The novel is told from the point of view of Emily and David. In the beginning of the book, we see how David and Emily become friends and how David tries to break down her walls and win her over. However, there is no love story. Emily is a young woman who wants a man who will protect her, not a man she would turn into a man after years of loving him. In fact, one could argue that the book gives a false impression of a love story by not really showing Emily and then showing David. There is no romance either. I was reminded of a similar book called "How to Marry a Millionaire" where you meet an older woman who has several kids, her own house, and even a rich husband. There was just something about the book that didn't sit well with me. It felt like I was watching an adult cartoon show. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are only a few films in the history of cinema that have ever made me happy.  It's not often you get to spend a day or two in a beautiful tropical island paradise.  There's a lot to like about the film, though not much of the characters do.   A lovely story and a nice mix of drama and comedy, it's a great time for anyone looking for a good time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When the last Alien movie came out, it didn't really get good reviews. The ending, as I said was an exercise in silliness. But if it had been a good Alien movie it'd have been a masterpiece. It just takes the best part of the original Alien film and does a more subtle and dark take on the story.  It's definitely a worthy sequel to Alien. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I know a lot of people who enjoy a good thriller. Most of them are thrillers with an element of suspense and suspenseful twists. I am not a big fan of suspenseful suspenseful thrillers, but The Last Exorcism is definitely a good one. A very strange movie. A real story told in a strange manner, with all kinds of peculiar twists.

This is one I will definitely want to watch again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want to see a good bad movie, you don't want to miss this one.  It's the rare Hollywood movie that is not a mess, and it's one of the rare movies that actually works as a picture.    A few decades ago, Hollywood was trying to make a new kind of movie, a Western style thriller starring the leading man, Billy the Kid.  The producer, John Schulze (Hogan's Heroes, Dragnet) tried to get Billy out there in a new, western style picture. Billy was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.  So he went to work. He worked hard, made a little money.  But that wasn't enough.  His father and brothers, also all wealthy, wanted more for Billy than just money. Billy and his brothers, who are all much bigger than they are, were told they must give up their money. They were told that they were never going to be any good because of a genetic condition that the family has.  Their father, John, says that the only thing that's going to keep Billy from running away, running away is his fear of the light, of going up the mountain with the big guns.  John said that they are all going to die, that one of them is going to have a heart attack.  Then, it gets worse: his wife, Mary Jane, has the same genetic condition as the kids.  Mary Jane believes that only by giving up everything else she's going have a chance of being a decent human being.  In a bid to convince her that she should give up her fortune, John and Billy, along with Mary Jane's nephew, get a gun.  They set out for the top of the mountain.  With one shot to the back, MaryJane turns to her husband, and says, "Do you know what you just did?"  When Billy looks at his wife with such sorrow, his eyes well up with tears.  Billy has never been so heartbroken.  What makes this story even worse is that the kids don't know that the gun is real.  It just looks like a little gun because, of course, there's nothing to protect it from the elements.  That's one flaw in a movie.  Another is how the two kids, Mary and Joseph, are the best-looking and best-educated kids in the movie.   However, they also have a genetic problem. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a genre full of cheesy and silly action films, we have a pretty good one. The plot takes place in an alternate universe where the Roman Empire never fell, and that gives it a nice twist. This movie is really good, I highly recommend watching it. If the Romans had stayed around and didn't get wiped out in AD 43 (I'm being generous here) they may have even had the chance to re-build their empire into a major power. I like that people who had died out to an extent like Lucius Aemilius Flaccus, the guy who invented wine, get a good return in this movie. But don't take my word for it, go and watch it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not have the best time with "The Big C" - so bad that I wanted to throw it over my shoulder. I'm disappointed in a bunch of people who didn't get the point of that movie. I'd give it an F if it was as bad as a lot of people seem to think it is. Not only are there way too many jump cuts (the actors have a hard time keeping track of where they are in the movie), but the "action" is way too boring for my liking. One guy is running away with a girl who seems to be a circus freak - which turns out to be her father's bodyguards, who have just run into a bunch an guns when they see a police officer on his way to arrest the father. They decide to stop chasing the police officer in their jeep. They don't have to, of course, but why not? That would be a cool scene - except that there isn't really much "action". In fact, what is portrayed is pretty much just one guy following another guy (in the car) through a buncha towns and some weird woods. There are only a couple of fights - a lot more than in any movie I've seen - and no gunfights, which are usually pretty much the stuff of Western movies. I thought that this movie would be all right - after all, it was made for a low budget, and it looks really good. But it is a disappointment. The acting is good - and pretty good all around.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not just the story that is a winner:  It's a story with a lot of heart that will make you feel sorry for poor Bunkan's little brothers.    If I was to put my name on a hat and call it the "Mao of China", the story of a group of little children who are sent to live at the orphanage run by a very sadistic, evil, sadist is an extremely powerful picture:   The film shows how children who grow up in a family which is totally different from their parents and have no contact with them are completely in a state of panic.  To make matters worse, the head of the family, the cruel but kind old woman is planning to take the children away.  With that evil, horrible, and horrible sounding name, the film is so much more than just a story. The film is more than that: It is a powerful and compelling story.    It is not a story about how kids and little kids should grow up and live life.  It is an incredibly powerful look at how the world we live in, which is so corrupt and depraved it is almost ridiculous, has the power to destroy a little child's life and his small family.  The film is filled with some beautiful, haunting, haunting music:  This is my favorite piece:  The song I love so much is called "The Child".  This song is one of the best of the year.  In "The child", a lonely little boy plays a game with his doll.  The poor kid is in a strange, evil world where it is so cold and lonely there is not even a tree to speak of. The little boy is trying to get the doll to talk. He doesn't succeed and eventually a strange creature walks by. The monster tells the boy that all animals do not get a chance to play like this.  One of the greatest songs ever recorded.  For me it is also the film's strongest emotional image.  This image of the little boy who has never been loved and has no one to play with and the evil and cruel woman who wants to kill him so much.  And finally the song that perfectly represents the movie: A beautiful, sad, and emotional piano ballad about an orphan kid's dream of seeing a girl who is a little bit "different".  I have been a fan of this song since I was a little kid.  Every time I
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is pretty much perfect. It is an enjoyable, charming, charming movie. It has the feel of a charming love story, but it is much more than that. There are so many amazing aspects in this movie that it's impossible to list them all. I won't bother trying to do so, I just want to get it out of the way. For starters, there are the beautiful, charmingly-dressed girls. The main characters' feelings toward them are shown by the subtlety of the acting. The best acting is performed by the main characters themselves. It's a very enjoyable movie to watch. It may not be perfect (there is some cliched, sexist dialogue that the director must have been trying to avoid), but it isn't bad at all. It does have a few flaws, though, so keep an eye out for them. I don't have a lot of negative comments about this movie. As I said, it's a really cute movie and you should just watch it.

I think I heard about it from one of my buddies at his bar. I don't remember the ending, but I did like it.  C.T.T: This is the first film I've seen in a while that I didn-t enjoy. It was so bad I just couldn't laugh at it. It's not a bad movie per se, just in this case, I found it pretty disappointing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really don't know how to describe this film without using the word "tremendous". This film tells a very interesting story about a group of men in the 1930s who are forced to play a game of hide and seek when one of the participants is found dead. The film was made in 1954. The acting, direction, and cinematography are superb, and the music is amazing. It's a fascinating film that I recommend to anyone who enjoys a good mystery movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A movie so good, it has to be good!    The plot is straightforward and not the hardest part. It's all about the "little" girl who is sent to a new school and who makes friends with the other new kids at a different school.   I'm a big Harry Potter fan and my kids are a lot like the characters in Harry Potter.  It is one of the few movies I can watch with the kids without them feeling intimidated (because of the movies they know and love)   It was fun to see a lot of different things in the movie: a boy who looks like Harry Potter and a woman who has the same hairstyle (but the colors) and a lot more!  I would definitely recommend this movie to any fan of Harry Potter (and Lord of the Rings and other children's books).  "She is a beautiful young lady, and she's as big a Potter fanatic as we are!"

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can see why the film is considered such a classic:  This is a film with strong messages:    The main point of this film is that God does not exist. And even in the case of a real God, a loving and caring God, who does care about the fate of this poor, suffering and unfortunate little girl, it is unlikely that he or his creation would choose such a person to be our first, or even our seventh, or ninth, or twelfth person. God is a loving God but he is also just another person who loves people in his own way. The first movie shows us that God loves us. The second movie shows that we should love people just like God loves them. That is all.

As far as this one goes, it was an interesting mix of films - "Jaws" meets "Ghostface." The acting was quite good, and the theme song and score were good (but not as good as I would have liked). I really enjoyed watching it, and will probably go back and watch it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed "Star Trek Into Darkness" a lot. I liked the way this movie looked. I didn't like the way it was filmed. It was dark and creepy and a little bit too much like a horror movie. It is definitely a film made by Trek fans. The only one who can play the Star Trek guitar is Robert Patrick. I've never seen the movie but I heard it was really good. It has a lot to say about space. It talks about how our planet could have been the place that created space travel but now that we've discovered other planets, we don't want to go back to our home planet. We're a spacefaring species and we like to visit other planets but we don a lot of technology. We need to stop doing that. We should be moving to a more primitive technology but instead we've become so sophisticated. We now have time machines. We want to make our old planet look like it did when we were still primitive and I guess it looks like that. The aliens do seem to like us. They seem to be impressed with our ability to travel fast. We are still primitive but we are now advanced and we're not going to change. I loved that the alien came back to Earth. I think that was a nice touch. I thought it would be fun to have him come back to the planet where he was born. I like the old movie "The Fugitive" because the aliens were like that but it was an old sci-fi movie. I guess this movie is in a science fiction category.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not going to write a negative review about this movie.    One of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in a long time, and not a terrible movie in general.  The main hero is a super hero, you know, the kind who flies through the air like Spider-Man.  A guy who could have been Spider-man but didn't.  And to show the world he has more than a little super-strength.  It's almost like they wanted to make him feel different, but the result is still the same.     They don't care. They do not really care about anyone.  They do what they want. They just want to do it with extreme cruelty.  I don't even want to talk about the people who are tortured.     And the movie doesn't shy away from how sick it is.   It is hard to find a more sick movie in the history of horror than The Devil's Backbone.   The movie doesn''t just make you sick. It makes you want to throw up and vomit so bad that you think you will throw up in your mouth so bad you will actually throw up.  That is how sick this movie is.   If you don't have a strong stomach, you might have a bad time watching this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the 1950s, the US Government conducted a series of hypnosis experiments on unsuspecting volunteers. This is what happened: Hypnosis was believed to have psychic effects, but nothing had been discovered until the 1950's. One of the experiments was a classic: a group of people were put into a large room with a mirror, an electrified floor, and a high voltage generator. A hypnotist entered the room and a stranger came in. The stranger was dressed in a very stylish outfit: a dark suit with a white shirt, dark trousers, and boots. He also carried a gold watch on a chain. The hypnosis began. Suddenly the stranger stood up, looked at the hypnotized people, and said "you have to forgive them: when they see them smiling on TV, they get their joy in the way of smiles." The entire group of hypnotized volunteers froze in disbelief. The hypnotist continued "Now I'll try it to my best to teach you a lesson. You, and anyone in the room, will remember this for the rest of your lives. You are just a bunch of children playing at being adults. I'm the adult who looks like a child. You're all just kids, and I'm very good-looking. " The experiment ended. When the hypnotist took the gold watch off the chain he found a ring hidden under the watch. He hid it under his shirt before he left. When his wife returned home from her work, she found a box full of photographs showing various US Presidents. One showed the man who would become President of the United States. All the other presidents were naked, except for President Hoover. After his death in 1947, all the photographs of the naked Presidents were destroyed. This movie is a good example of a movie that is fun, scary, and educational for kids and adults alike. You have to be there to see this movie.  Posted by John L at 5:54 PM

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a decent action flick with cool guns, cheesy dialog, and a cast of memorable characters. You see, the bad guys at the time wanted to kill the good guys by using a special weapon invented by the scientist who created the suit in the first place. We all knew what that weapon was supposed to do, it was a nuclear gun powered by a bomb that was stored in a tube inside the suit. It wasn't any different from the bombs used in World War I when they were known as the Little Boy and the Fat Man. So the government developed the weapon and they were ready to use it to annihilate the world, but they needed a way to test it. The government sent in the bad guy from the first movie to test the gun, that guy turned out to be the bad dude from the end of the first flick who is just getting out of the hospital after having a heart attack. Of course the badguy had to take care of the bad Guy from the beginning of the second flick, he just can't stay dead! Anyway, the government was desperate, so they turned to the good Guy from Part 1 (he was supposed be a little older but played a little younger) to come up with a way of stopping the bad Guys from exploding, since he has the most power in the army. So he sent a missile up to a building, then he called it the "Man-On-a-Rocket" and sent it into the building, but that didn't take long at all, it exploded and the badGuy died from radiation poisoning. Then the goodGuy did this horrible thing with the other missiles that he had in his suitcase, a few more of his missiles were in the same suitcase, and then the goodguy got a hold of a nuclear rocket and was ready to bomb the bad thing. Well, it seems the bad Thing was very strong and the Good Thing couldn't handle that power, the good thing was able to take out a few missiles and he went on the run to the government building to hide his evidence and destroy the "bomb". Well, the army caught up with the good guy, they were going to take him away, but the bad Things didn't want to just let him off, so a fight broke out and they both went down, and the "Bomb" exploded with the bombs that the goody-two shoes had in the suitcase. Well the bad things were all destroyed, and with a little more luck, maybe the government
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film, set in a rural Welsh community, was based on a novel of the same name by John Wyndham, a rural-grit writer who lived a simple life in an agricultural community, where he worked on his farm and lived alone, occasionally attending church with his mother. His story of growing up in a Welsh village and dealing with the difficulties that go along with that, particularly the loss of a beloved dog, made it a popular story for children. It was followed by a book series of the novels, followed by two more novels, and the BBC adapted the first two books into a radio series.  A fairly straightforward story that I found interesting, with a little story at the end that makes it more difficult to figure out what happened.  I really enjoyed it, it's just a shame there's no DVD or blu-ray. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was born in 1952 in New York. After graduating from college in 1961, I worked in TV commercial advertising and radio. The latter job required me to go to Mexico in 1968 for a year, a trip which was very good for my soul as well as my wardrobe. I returned to New York and got a job at a big city advertising agency, which put me in some of the best situations possible. My clients were like the Beatles. They were fun to be with and had the makings of a hit band. One day during a meeting of the firm, I got a call from my agent asking if I wanted to be a consultant. I said I didn't, that I wasn't sure which way to go and would take a chance at being a songwriter. My agent gave me a check for $1000 and said it was for the job, which he then wrote out on a check stub. After I arrived at the studio, the manager was out and I had to wait in the hallway. When I looked at the check, there was no signature so I went around to the door and tried the door handle which didn't lock. I turned back to the manager and said, "This is the check." He looked at me funny and said with a chuckle, "Why don't you make a new check for the rest of the amount?" I went back to my agent and told him the story. He said, OK, but don't ever do that again. After about a week in New Mexico, I realized I didn not like it. It was hot, humid, and the people weren't friendly. The manager was a complete jerk, I didn the worst meals, slept on my stomach at one of the most beautiful hotels in town, and I didn t like the way they made me work hard. I decided to leave the next day. I didn 't want to go back to where I had been, so I borrowed $750 from my parents and flew home. I was so tired and depressed, I couldn't wait to get back home. My parents were really upset when they heard the news, and my sister was even more distraught, saying that my life was going to take a turn for the worse. I told her I was going back to school and that I was never coming back. I also told her to go ahead and take the check. It really had no value to her, but that is where I began my long journey of self-discovery
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie about a really bad movie. If this movie had been made on a major studio, it might have gotten a decent movie rating. Instead, it ended up as a major flop. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm going to stop here for a moment and explain that this is probably not the best film on Earth, but at least it is an entertaining and funny movie. There are times when the jokes feel forced and the story seems a little forced too, but most of these things can be forgiven by the fact that they are all delivered by an absolutely ridiculous ensemble cast, with actors who can barely deliver anything in the slightest believable manner. In short, this is an enjoyable movie with some good jokes and some bad ones.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a fun and silly romp through the '80's. The cast is great, the story is entertaining, and the songs are all in good taste. This movie makes the point that there are many aspects of pop culture that are as old as the hills and yet we are still able to laugh about them.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never got around to seeing this film back when I was a little kid. Now in my late twenties and with a wife that doesn't really care about movies anymore I decided to give it another chance and I'm glad I did.   This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought this one was okay. There was the typical fantasy plot, but this movie doesn't seem to focus on any one character. There are some good action scenes, and the characters are well written, if a little flat.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As you can tell from the title, this was a well-known movie in the 80's and was one of the classics of the genre. I watched this back in high school. I loved it.   The story was simple and straightforward but it had great acting.  Some of the best parts of the movie were the ones that occurred on a train ride. The one where they went to the gas station for fuel was awesome and the ones where they rode with the circus people was awesome. The movie really got me when they were on the train and the scene where they were walking back to the hotel room were my favorites.  I also enjoyed the part where they got the kids a new bicycle because they were tired and were going to go back to school. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It is a very good mix of action and comedy. The action is well done with the characters being very well done. It has all the features that I have come to expect from the genre. I will be recommending this to everyone who is a fan of the action genre, The movie will be in my film collection for a long long time to come. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the early 1970's, a little boy was walking across the grassy slopes of a California mountain range when he came across a strange creature. The creature was a little red lizard that he referred to as "Big Red" and his father, who was also nearby, said it was "very curious." Little Red ran back to where he was staying with his father so his father could catch the creature before it ran away. The little boy went to get his father and while Little Red was gone his dad spotted a small creature, probably no more than a foot tall, walking up a slope. When the creature climbed the side of a mountain, his father yelled out to the boy that Big Red was coming. When Little Red turned the corner, it was almost too late to stop him, and his dad shot him in the head. After this, the little boy came to know that the creature had been a little girl. This little girl lived among the trees of a small mountain town, and her brother was the only person who knew who she was. She was a "little red lizard" who liked to get wet and play with the rocks and grass. Little Red always wanted to be a big red lizard.    I had seen many movies where a little kid discovers his mother, sister, father, and brother in a strange place.  In this movie we find out that when Little Red, who had lived in a small town and never knew that her brother had been with a "big red lizard," got lost on a hike, the big red was the one who found her. I know my little boy won't grow up to be "Little Red" but who knows what a little "red lizard" could accomplish...
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you don't like the idea of a "dancing girl", do yourself a favor and not watch this movie. I can tell you that the dancing girl does not work as a gimmick.   It is very weird to watch a film where one of the characters makes a dance move and everyone else does the same.  Even the song which plays during the film is extremely annoying, so much so that I had to turn it off.  So why does that mean that this is a bad movie?   Well, the premise of the film, of course, is that the main character (who is a woman) uses her feminine charms to help her husband get a date with another woman.  In a sense this is kind of true. Unfortunately, the film also includes a large cast of characters, most of whom are completely useless.  To give a small sample, there is a blind woman, a deaf man, a man who has two wives, a woman who has a dog, and one female bodyguard who only appears to be there to be annoying.  It gets even worse when one of those women in the film makes a pass at one of her male co-stars.  The whole film is bizarre, and it doesn't help that the camera work is extremely awkward.  What the film lacks in acting it certainly makes up for in the stupid, over-the-top antics of some of the cast members.  I was actually shocked by how much I enjoyed the film at one point.  Not only did I have fun watching the film for the first time, but I also enjoyed it on several other occasions afterwards.  Posted by John O'Bannon at 7:00 AM
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one was a great experience for me. I went in with the idea that it was some kind of sci-fi adventure movie. I loved that aspect. The only thing that I felt was a little bit off about it, was that they got to do some pretty fantastic things that weren't done in this generation of science fiction movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very excited about this movie. It has an awesome story and I loved the characters. I really loved the whole story about how the aliens first came to earth. I loved how the guy who created the machine was a really nice guy and he was a good friend to the guy and they always made sure everyone was happy. I think this movie was a little slow at times but I loved every minute of it and I would definitely watch this movie again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this movie so much I bought a ticket and went to see it again!  The director, Brian De Palma, is one of my all-time favorite filmmakers.  In fact, this movie could easily be an entire De Palmas film.  So, the movie begins with a young boy in a school.    But his school is a boarding school.     In order to attend the boarding school, he needs to be an Eagle Scout.  But what does an Eagle scout need with a rifle?   And why does he want to shoot the president? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my experience, the cast and crew that worked on the production of the film, were more than capable of making a film that could be watched by people of all ages. The acting on the whole was excellent, with the exception of a couple of the actors, but then this may be a movie for little ones who will not be able to sit through a 90 minute movie for every line or character to speak, so they will not miss anything important.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The great thing about this movie is that it not only has a solid plot line, it makes you care. This is an adult film, not a children's film. In fact, even when you have a little girl, you are entertained. However, the story is a bit on the slow side. However you are more entertained as a couple of kids are running around with an old lady who is in a wheelchair. As time goes on, it is more and more difficult to not care about the story. It is not really a very good movie, but it is entertaining and a good introduction to the genre.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was not a bad movie. It's the first time I've seen them play, the movie was pretty good, it was definitely the first movie I'd ever seen. If it weren't for the terrible ending it would have been a good little movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is the second version of "The Wizard of Oz".   This movie, like the original "The Wonderful Wizard of OZ", is a "good old boy" that is "loved" by audiences around the world, so much so that when a sequel was made "The Wicked Wizard of the West" was also made.   In the book, there are "good people" and there are wicked people, but they are not evil or mean people, they just do things that are necessary to keep the world running.  The Wicked Wizard is no different, as he uses "magical tricks" to try and scare Dorothy away from the beautiful Land of Oz, but all of it works to bring the young girl back.  "The Witch of the Well" is the last of the "Tin Men" in this film and she plays the "lovable" part.  After being frightened by the Wicked Wizard he and his wife flee the Land of Ooz, the Tin Men (who all look the same) are chased down by a beautiful witch, who plays a beautiful song, which is very similar to "The Frog Prince" from the movie "Ralph Breaks the Curse".  Unfortunately, the witch does not know she is a witch and so, she runs into a well which is filled with a sticky yellow slime that eats all of the characters before they even get their chance to go into the forest.  I always thought that this is the one part of the movie where they just added a lot more slime and they should have made a whole extra film with a lot of these scenes, but you still get a good laugh, so that is good enough for me.  This film was a "bad omen" for many people who saw it when it first came out, but now they have seen it twice, they know why.  You will find it difficult to find a copy of this film these days, but it is a favorite of mine, and I hope that someday someone will find a version that will satisfy my cravings for this classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really liked this movie! It was fun to watch. I liked the comedy and the characters. I don't like how one character is constantly calling another "goddamn fool". I think "Nig" should call another "Goddamn Fucking Nig"! I don' t like how the guy walks back and forth on his knees trying to impress people. He seems like a jerk. It is funny at times but other times it is really weird. I thought the movie ended just before the bad guy's henchmen came and put the bad man in the trunk. I didn't want to go back.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember watching this movie back in the 80's and loving it. Now that I'm old and can see it on DVD it's even more hilarious (and I loved the jokes). The cast and crew were really fun to work with, and I enjoyed seeing old jokes and the "what were they thinking" moments.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was in attendance for the opening night performance of John Waters' bizarre, twisted movie, and there are a few things I must say.  It had everything you've ever wanted to know from a Waters film:   A great performance from Johnny Depp,    The oddest, weirdest film since The Dead Zone.   All of the characters were hilarious in their eccentricity, with the oddest being, of course, the clown.   A great performance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have heard that there are some similarities between the movie and the song 'The Last Time We Say Goodbye' from the hit TV series 'Murder, She Wrote.' But it is not the same movie. The movie looks much better than the TV series!   For those who don't know the TV show is based on the true story of the last time we ever met.   The movie was written by a writer known as J. D. Salinger. The screenplay was directed by Robert Altman. This movie is not rated very high, but for an unknown writer in the early 60s it is pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very well crafted film with a strong, original and clever script and well directed movie.   I found this film interesting as it deals with some subjects that are more or less taboo in today's society. As such it is a welcome change of pace to some movies that deal with social issues and political correctness. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. I'm not a fan of movies with a lot of violence, violence being my preference, but I enjoyed this. It was funny, I enjoyed it. It is about a boy who is trying to be a real man (and then some), and the girl who is not a boy. The film plays out like a comic book, in a storybook. I loved it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There are a lot of good, but nothing that will blow your mind.    I've seen many films over the years that I didn't like at all, but not this one.  If you really want to see a movie about a crazy guy with a gun, and a crazy lady, you would have been better off watching a "Laser Flash," or "The Killer's Wife."   It's hard to put my finger on what's so great about this movie, except that the characters were so realistic, and so well done, that I could have sat in a movie theater for three days.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had a really good time watching the new movie: Pee Wee's Big Adventure.  I found it amusing that the character of Pee-Wee Herman is not only the greatest cartoon character of all time, but also, the funniest one ever.  If you have a good laugh at this movie, you will laugh for days.  You will laugh until you cry.  It's very good.  (review courtesy of Roger Ebert).
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first movie I ever saw in a theater was a great one.  With a wonderful sense of humor, the movie is a wonderful blend of humor and science fiction.    In fact, I remember the opening of the movie as my very first time having anything in my mouth.  And I can see why everyone loved it.  The film is set in the future where the world has advanced to an advanced state of technology.  Most of the time this involves an advanced technology that keeps humanity at the top of the food chain.  This state is known as the Hyperborean Empire.  There are a few humans living out here on Earth but most are still out in the Hyperbolian mountains where they live under the watchful eyes of the hyperborean empire.  The main character is a Hyperboreans.  He is a little robot that happens to be human enough to look the part.  His name is Sam.    He was given to him by his parents in order to help him with his studies.  However, he has very few friends.  Because of this the most important person in his life is a cat named Sam. Sam is a very interesting looking and smart robot.  One of his main attributes is that he has an imagination, so he does things with his mind.  I found him very relatable and had a great time with this movie.  Sam is an example of the future the movies was trying to show us.  At the time, this movie was made the idea was that the future would be similar to Star Trek, with robots that were intelligent, friendly, but very lovable.  It did not turn out like this.  In a lot of ways it's like the last years of the Roman Empire, with the emperors running the government, the Roman people getting their asses kicked, but never able to rise up against them.  While the movie tries to show how the state could work better and how the robots could work together to save the people, it is not successful in doing so.  Instead, the most interesting aspect of the film is that the robots do not work well in harmony with one another, though at first this seems like a bad thing.  Unfortunately this leads to them coming to blows and having to be controlled by the humans, who only have control over them in a very limited manner.  Even worse are the moments where the robots try to help each other out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the first time I'm enjoying a film that doesn't involve me in the plot and doesn't try to force me into a role in the story. If I were forced to make an assessment of the film, I'd say it's a solid film that can stand on its own merits, and has a lot of potential. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the sequel to the 1985 film "Mister Smith Goes Hollywood", but it is worth watching this one for the story alone, as well as the great acting and direction by the same writer/director: Mike Nichols, in this film the film is set in 1920's Hollywood and about a famous Hollywood film director, played by Paul Newman, whose film is about a man who gets mixed up in a murder case and then meets a pretty girl. When this film was first released, a lot of critics and viewers thought it was a little over-rated and that the story could have been much more interesting. But the film has since been remade as the sequel, a film called "Misters Smith Goes West". I have not seen the remake, but I've heard it is actually quite a good film, and some critics are even lauding it as a worthy remake of the original.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie about two gay guys who fall in love with each other. That is all. They are not allowed to see each other in the privacy of their respective homes. When two men, with a great need for each other, meet at a nightclub, the two have a whirlwind romance...with consequences that are far from the romantic, romantic, beautiful, wonderful romance they had hoped for. But even after two years of living together and trying to make it work, the pair never did quite fall in...
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the classic horror movie from the 1950s, and it has an unspeakable power and frightfulness.   Director Robert Bloch and his cast make you feel really sick to your stomach.  One scene was so creepy it made my teeth vibrate.  It's just as I remember it - a woman is walking through a farm field on a moonless night when a farmer's dog attacks her. The dog gets away and turns into a wolf and bites the woman on the head.  A man comes out of a small hut and sees the wolf attacking the woman, and then the wolf turns into the woman as he turns to run away.  And there's a very creepy ending.  As I look at this film now it seems very dated.  I'm not sure how many people actually saw this film but for me it really stood the test of time.  - November 2, 2014This is really old now

He is given a job as the town's Sheriff (which is a lot of fun since you know everyone in this small town will be friendly.  He also gets to spend some time with his girlfriend who gets him into trouble!   I recommend a trip out to this little town for sure!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's all about the music here... (even the music in this movie is great, as are the other parts of the movie. In a nice twist, the movie actually starts with the music (even if the film is a bit slow...), even if it's quite obvious at that time that the movie is about the life and death of the famous composer. However, as it says in the credits... this movie really isn't about the musician at all. It's more about the composer himself, and it tells a very funny tale about a great love which was born here. This movie is definitely not to be missed.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an incredibly well written film, that never overstays its welcome (and I am so happy about that) by taking the time to flesh out the story of one of the most important and under-appreciated authors. The film is not just beautiful or thrilling, it is also a beautiful homage to literature and a tribute to the authors who have inspired it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   An interesting, if not a little boring movie in that there are no aliens, aliens are not what the movie is about. And the only aliens that are present are the humans, so that makes it quite a dull movie.   The movie is set in a space station named MOSI and is about the two brothers who work there: the first one being the boss and the second one the new hire.  It has the feel of an old 80's sci-fi film: a bit cheesy and not very original, but still a nice watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As one of my favorite genres, science fiction, gets a new treatment in the new release 'Bender Must Die'. I must say that the film had a great premise in the fact that it was based on the character Bender from the TV series Futurama. It is a sci-fi action comedy which I always found funny. There is not much to be done in the first fifteen minutes of the film which is good. There are some great and funny lines like "We need more robots like Bender!" and "What happened to your eyes?" and "We gotta stop him!" The other main characters that the viewers gets to see in this film are Bender himself and his Robot companions from other episodes. It takes a good few minutes before we get to know these characters well but by then it is obvious that they are all very different from one another. Bender does not have a whole lot to do so there is little to write about. However, I must mention that the only robot in the film who is not a robot is Fry's Mother (she actually looks more like a cross between a human and a rabbit) but she is played by the very talented Angela Waterden who also appears in another film called 'The Bots and the Bees' (also mentioned earlier) and a good one at that.   This is why we love science fiction:  Another problem that I had with this film was the fact it took too long to get to the action scenes (which were a major let down for me). The other problem was the way Bender was written. He was not my favorite character of the series (as he never got much development throughout the entire run of the show). But I always felt that he was one of the more likable of the characters and I always enjoyed the fact he was in many of the episodes that I enjoyed so much. But I felt that there was nothing in the way of his character in the entire film. I didn't feel any character development whatsoever for any of the other characters, especially those that were meant to be played by Angela Waterbury.  This is one of those movies that is too bad it didn't get a better reviews.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie a couple weeks ago and I was pleasantly surprised with the film.   It has a good premise and an engaging plot.  At it's core this movie is a revenge story about a man who takes his wife's virginity, has her do a threesome with three other guys, and then beats the living shit out of them with a brick.  It's pretty brutal but it also leaves you with a lot of questions: Why was she so promiscuous? Why did she make her life such a living hell? What was she thinking taking off her clothes for a bunch of men?   The film has a very good soundtrack from an impressive ensemble cast.  So if you like revenge, beat up men, and a good beat up, this is a good place to see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of my best friends told me about a movie she saw last night, I had never heard it before, but I loved the plot, so I bought the soundtrack. Now I have a new favorite movie and you are really wrong if you are not watching it, and I wish I were not, the movie is about an Indian man named Raj Singh, who is traveling back in time after he falls into an ancient temple in India. What makes the movie more interesting is the fact that Raj Singh has lost his job as a chauffeur and his life because he is always traveling around to find a new job that is available at the time. As a result, Raj Singh is often depressed because he's never able to find the right job.  After visiting all of the temples in India, Raj and his friend, Mr. A, must try to get back to the year 1882 and stop Raj Singh from being thrown in prison for the crime of getting mad at a girl. This film is not only about the Indian man traveling through time, it's also about the friendship between Mr.A and Raj Singh. I loved watching Raj Singh try his best to save his friend's life. Raj Singh was also a character I would like to see in movies like these. Raj is one of those friends who always does what he thinks is best for the guy he's with. But he does have a sense of humour. In the end Raj and Mr.B are able to get past their problems and make it back to 1882.  I highly recommend this movie, and it is a must see for all movies lovers!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is not only an action film, but also a psychological film.   The story starts when a man from Mars has a dream in which he meets a beautiful woman named Alia (Berta Costin). This dream is so beautiful that he has to come back.    From Mars, a man named Gail (Hans Holbein) has been told that his ex-girlfriend, Eliza (Maeve O'Connor), will be married soon. Eliza is not interested in a man like Gail and he is not willing to put up with her anymore.  Gail arrives in England, but the people of England don't want him.  They make fun of him, and try to force him to leave.  Gail leaves Britain and the woman who used to be his girlfriend is with him. However, they are married and they get along well.  The plot gets complex and very good when the plot is based on the "lurking" and trying to get to know each other.  What really makes this movie is the movie itself.  I am a big fan of action films.  This movie is very entertaining.  If you are looking for something new, or to see a new director, this is worth checking out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only reason we get this is because of our obsession with David Lynch   As a David Lynch fan, you've read the reviews. If you haven't, you will now. If your not already a fan of Lynch, I highly recommend this movie. Even with his eccentricities, you can't help but laugh. You'll laugh so hard that your head might explode (not that it'll hurt). Even with Lynch's weirdness, it's still a funny movie. There are lots of times when we laugh out loud.   I've loved movies like this ever since I was a kid. I have no interest in the film that inspired this film or the cult following it has built.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The         'Gangster of Bay Street'   is not an unusual film in the cinema industry, for there is a whole genre of films which are based on the same genre as this one. But, of course, it is not in this same genre at all. The film is a comedy-drama which is about an ex-con who falls in love with a woman who is played by a really attractive young woman by the name of Lina Medina.   Unfortunately, they have a fight and then the ex-Con wants to leave town (he has a job in Philadelphia which he is leaving) and the girl then wants to marry him.  This is not a film that appeals to all the audience and is probably more for one who is used to the same sort of comedy-films as in American movies.  For me, one of the most   interesting aspects of this film is the   portrayal of the ex -Con who is not too bad.  He is not totally evil, though, is not completely in the right place.  The reason he is not entirely in the wrong place, is because of a very cleverly played piece of dialogue by a character who is a complete fool. I have to say that I liked the ex Con.  There are some   funny scenes,  but I   was just   bored with the  end   of this whole film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen a lot of movies and this one is one of the better ones.   It is set in a city, I am not sure why it isn't called "Shenzhen"   The Chinese city is a modern urban wonderland.  Some of the buildings look like something from an alien planet.  There is a strange underground tunnel system. It was like being in another galaxy.  I don't know if I should be impressed or scared. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is no other movie that does justice to the concept of a movie set in the early 20th Century. I have watched it several times and I still marvel. I also love the cinematography of the movie. I hope that this movie gets made a long time after and is a must watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie itself is quite enjoyable for the time it was made.   It's got an excellent cast and good acting by all but this movie had a few problems.  At times, it doesn't feel like a movie and it's just over.  The whole time, there's the feeling that you're being taken for a ride and you don't really feel like you've gotten what you're supposed to.  It has a lot of good plot lines but those plot lines don't necessarily come together, especially with some of the character developments.  There are a couple of good lines but they can't really be applied to most people.  This movie is definitely worth checking out for those who like good old fashioned adventure films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While "Memento" may not be the best movie I have seen in quite a long time, it is a very good example of how not to do a horror movie.   The script is pretty good, if predictable.  The film is slow and creepy, and then there is a pretty cool little cliffhanger!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is great. It is a very well done thriller that doesn't try too hard to give the viewer the sensation that the movie will be an action packed movie that will leave you shocked. It will surprise you with the things that you won't expect to see in a thriller movie. The story is a good story with some very good acting. However, there are two flaws that can be seen in this movie. One is that the story has one major flaw: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie opens with the main character in his underwear, being taken to the police station to interview his wife and children. A policeman who's been looking for him for two days turns in to his neighbor (who works at the same station as the police) and says he had seen a woman in a blonde wig sitting on a chair outside his house. "Who is she?" "That's Lulu, the girl who killed the mother of the boy I used to marry years ago." (I was eight years old, which is more than enough time to forget everything.) Lulu turns out to be the wife of the son who killed his wife. Lulu kills a policeman (who's only purpose in life is to look for him). Lulu runs down a man in the street, killing him. One of her children kills another policeman, who's then killed by a stray bullet. As for Lulu's boyfriend's family, his father and uncle are at the station waiting for their son to come home. They see Lulu run into their house (she's so full of herself she's no longer wearing underwear) and the boy (who, by the way, is black) runs in and takes off his jacket and shirt (to reveal that he is wearing his own underwear). And then Lulu is shot in the face by one of her kids (who had no choice but to shoot her, as no one else was around) and she dies a few seconds later. There's no sense of time, as everyone dies in the blink of an eye (although the police officer, who was with Lulu the entire time, doesn't). The children are locked up in a cellar for two years. The police don't have much of a case, but it does give Lulu an out when she becomes famous. I really had to force myself to watch this movie because it was so awful.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is not a movie to enjoy in a room full of strangers. In fact I doubt if anyone else will watch this film. But if you like science fiction and you do not like movies about scientists on space shuttles, then this is the movie for you.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is pure camp from start to finish. It's hilarious how it starts like "Gee! What if this is the year 2000?" (No it isn't.) It's one of those movies where you think of it as being old. Then, it goes and turns into an 80's throwback. It was so campy and made the most ridiculous choices as to what movies were appropriate for the year in which it took place. It has its charms, but its just really bad. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you see this movie, you just feel like you're back in the 1980's. There is something almost cheesy about the comedy in this movie. It's almost laughable. And as you watch this movie the time goes by and you'll laugh at some of the jokes. I can't say too much about the acting of this movie but it's very good.  Also a good comedy movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know if it's a good or a bad thing that I have two movies of the same kind in one month of 2015.   On one hand, it means I haven't seen a movie this good this year yet.  On the other, it's probably the only thing the film industry has going for it right now.  A very good time spent with good guys, bad guys, and bad situations.  I'm a huge fan of Christopher Walken (I'm a big fan of any film that features him in a starring role) and I'm sure I'm not the only one. I'm also sure that he won't be playing himself in this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie, with the help of the great voice of Al Pacino, gives an insight into the life of a man who was the most hated man in America from the beginning of time. From the beginning we were told that this man was crazy. In fact, we never really saw him crazy. It was that he thought he was God incarnate and he lived like a king. He would have had a perfect life but for the fact that he was born into the wrong place in the wrong time. His father was a well respected and rich blacksmith and his mother was a poor blacksmith who was married to a white farmer. They had two daughters, one of whom was a bright young woman named Frances. But Frances had a big problem. Frances was the oldest child of a blacksmith father and a white mother and they all came from great wealth. Frances' parents would rather not have their family be known as rich because, if they were to be found out, the consequences would be very severe. Frances went off to a prep school where she learned to read and write well and become a good student. But no one believed that she was really "smart" and most people thought that she had a pretty bad attitude and was just bragging for the fame that came with being an "A" student. When Frances was 17 she got caught in an accidental drowning and a few years later Frances had to drop out of school for a while because her parents insisted that she would ruin her life. Frances never went back to school because her father wanted her to focus on making a better life for herself and Frances went into a saloon called The Big House, where she got drunk and started to act like a complete fool. This got her into more trouble, and more people started to notice her behavior. In an instant Frances' family was put in a terrible situation when she was accused of stealing a coat from a department store and accused of selling an expensive watch. This situation caused Frances to fall in love with a man named Bill and Frances to marry Bill. Bill got into a lot of trouble with the law and was eventually put in jail. Frances had gotten so used to life as a rich white saloon girl that she no longer cared that much about money. The first sign that something was terribly wrong came from her husband when Frances refused to go to the hospital with her husband and she did not go to work at all. After Bill was thrown in jail, Frances took in a lodger to live with her

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is true that a lot of bad movies were made during the 20th century and most of them weren't too bad. What I don't like is when a decent script with good actors is made to look like a cheap B-movie with bad special effects.  The story is good and a fun adventure is what we get here.  It has a good, old school feel to it, and this old school type of story is what I always loved with Western movies back in the day.  I really hope that this movie will be made again in some form and I look forward to seeing it on some type of video or a box set with the latest DVD release.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most important thing about this movie is the fact that there is something "different" about it: there is no time for the familiar (like a lot of these westerns, especially these old wests, are more western than "western" and the hero is not "western"), and there is a lot to be said about some really fascinating characters: the bad cowboy who is trying to live up to the myth he was made to live by: the beautiful girl, "Miss" Denton: the old gunslinger who has come back to "The West", as an outcast from the "good" old days: the pretty redhead who is being seduced by Mr. Good, a "bad hombre" who looks like the "old west's" "bad bad" sheriff: the good cowboy who has an intense dislike of these people. This movie is about the people.  The thing that is different about these stories is that they are true stories.  They are about real people: these stories are the "real life" of the people in these stories: they are real: we hear of real things: we do not know whether they are being used as stereotypes or real, but if the "bad cowboys" are not real, it is because the "heroes" in these western stories have no real "hero" at all.    What makes this movie interesting are the people themselves: they come through and tell us about a real cowboy society, in a time when there were "bad cowboy" people: the "white people". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good one. If you like good movies, you will like this one. It's not your typical movie, but it does a lot of things right. I am a big fan of Stephen King and I like to see him play. This one does not disappoint. The characters are very well written. I especially liked the evil guy. I did not mind the slow way things were handled, but I liked it.    This movie was just plain creepy, which is a great place to start.  If you want a good horror movie, go to see it in theaters. You'll be scared to death.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I read the synopsis of The Boy (1997), I was intrigued. And the plot of this film intrigued me even more. After viewing the movie, my interest was piqued even more since the boy in this movie is a nice young lad of about 16. The movie is about a girl that has been raped at age 9 years old. At age 17, she is in jail for raping someone and is not given a chance to reform. And she ends up getting an abortion at age 22 after spending 11 years in prison. The only thing that's shocking is how much a person can change. I have no idea why the girl is raped at such a young age. I mean, if the person that raped her didn't like her, why didn't they kill her? At first, I wondered why the people didn't just kill her in prison at an earlier date. After all, she was a 16 year old and clearly, there's not much she could have done to stop the rape. There is nothing shocking about her rape. It's not a rape that I would have even watched if I wasn't interested in the movie. She is raped and it is not a good time for a rape. But then again, it is a short movie. It was good for the first half of the movie and even when the movie got really good I just felt like I had seen it before. The plot line is quite similar to the movie "The Lost Boys" (1998). The same kind of story and characters with a rape as a main theme. The difference is that "The Boy" is a little bit more mature and a bit more entertaining. There were times that it really caught me off guard. There was one particularly interesting scene that really made me wonder what was going to happen next. The scene took place in a prison and the girl has to walk past a guy that is raping a girl. The girl is surprised by what she sees and it turns out that the guy is having sex with both of them. It is kind of sad and the guy just kind of shrugs it off. But, there was more to the scene. As I was watching this scene, I was thinking to myself that we've seen it all before. This is a rape, it's a gang rape, a woman is raped while it is happening, a girl is violated while it's happening. The most disturbing scene for me in this film was when the guy has his penis sucked out by the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was pretty good. It was fast-paced and exciting and did an excellent job of creating a nice atmosphere for the movie. I don't see why some people aren't fans of the movie but it doesn't take long before we get into the actual plot of the film. We have a young black girl, Aiko (Rikako Aida) that just arrived in Japan from the United States. She comes with her mother (Kumi Uchida) and an older brother (Yuki Shido). Aiko is smart and likes science. However, her mother doesn't believe in Aiko, a black girl. And that's all she has going for her in Japan, so she comes to Japan to learn her mother's bad habits. Aiko soon finds herself a very interesting and creative neighbor, Natsumi (Misa Fukuzumi). Natsume's (Toshio Matsumoto) house has a large amount of books and many strange things that Aiko notices in the house. Natsuma is a good friend of Natsumoto and he helps Aiko when she asks. I liked how Aiko helped Natsuki (Natsumi) when she asked. It seemed like this was a story that could only be told by a mother's son.  I also enjoyed how the movie played with the whole family dynamic. Aikko's mother is a very strict person with a strict and strict wife. But, the movie shows how Natsu's wife and their son (Natsuo Natsuhiko) have very different ideas on how to raise their children. When Natsusho, Aikako's mother, makes a speech, Aiki becomes very angry. I thought this was one of the more subtle ways of expressing the family's differences. I like how the kids didn't seem to be bothered by their mother's speech and how their mother seemed more concerned with Natsuko's education than her own.  For me, the best part of the whole movie was Aiko's relationship with Natsuo. They share a lot of similarities (Nai) and Natsu makes many observations about the two of them (Nagashimayo). I liked that this movie also showed the kids' parents and how these families deal with the differences between their own children.   If you like this movie, you might want to check out the other movies that come out in the same time frame. They're
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is great, it has the potential to be a great film, there's just something not right in it, it's kind of awkward to watch. The acting is good and I really enjoyed the story of the old man trying to go back in time and get revenge on the bad guys who have been tormenting him all his life, but he gets himself into lots of trouble along the way and ends up in a very bad situation, it seems as if the bad guy is the only one the old gentleman can trust, maybe that makes the old guy more evil than he lets on.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The last time I saw the film, in the 1980s, it's quite different from the one I have just seen.  It has lots of humor, and some great acting.    There is an amazing scene where Robert Mitchum is trying to find the owner of the "S" car and ends up in a movie theater.  It was like a great old western with great sound mixing, and a great ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie during the first weekend at the local movie theater. It was a very strange experience. The movie's director, Bruce McDonald, is a very unusual director and it's not surprising that most of his movies are pretty bad. The reason that this movie is so good is that Bruce McDonald has always had an eye for the peculiar.   The film stars John Travolta as Joe Pesci, who lives in a small town in the woods. When his girlfriend leaves him, he begins to suspect that someone is after him.  It's the kind of movie that you can't help but find very interesting even if you find Joe Pescie a little too odd-looking. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the middle of an episode of The West Wing , President Bartlet (or is it Mr. Bartlet?) had to make a decision about the future of his nation and the world. The President's chief of staff, Toby Ziegler, had made the decision to allow a Russian ambassador into the United States. As Zieglers only daughter was in a relationship with a Russian man, the President had had his daughter brought to America to start a new life. This, however, didn't sit right with the Russian government. While the Ambassador was a great diplomat, President Ziegers wife, and her mother were all killed in an act of terrorism. So the Ambassador wasn't an ideal choice to be allowed to stay in America. The Russians were going to send their ambassador to be judged by a court of Americans. As it turned out the American President was on the jury. And what a jury it was. Toby Ziegeller was the perfect choice for a trial by jury. At first, President Thomas Bartlet felt bad about this. As a trial attorney and as a father he couldn't think of a better choice. And when I say perfect, I mean exactly that. There wasn't a single bad thing that could be said about him. So a trial was set up between the Russian Ambassador and the President. Now the President doesn't actually have to attend the trial. However, he was forced to attend because the Russian ambassador was about to walk out of the courtroom. What follows was one of the most tense scenes to ever have been shown on a TV show. Toby was forced, literally pushed, by the Russian President to testify before the jury and testify against his own country. The trial was the most dramatic one the series had ever seen, and the scene was as tense as a Hollywood movie. It was also a case of revenge on a world that no longer wanted to be part of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this film, a man is trapped in a space station with a woman, a beautiful woman who has been imprisoned in the station for over 4 years. I think that this is one of the very few times that the studio made a movie about a woman in a confined place and it works quite well.  The movie does a great job of showing the loneliness and frustration of the woman as she waits for a rescue.  A lot of the scenes in this movie are extremely dark and sad.    The film was directed by Jules Dassin and produced by Charles Vidor and I'm grateful that Dassin was able to capture the atmosphere of the space station and the loneliness of the characters, even if the film is far from perfect. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This has the look and feel of a good old "pixar" movie but with a contemporary approach.   I was very impressed with how well these two directors knew how to present the story.  The story centers around two children, Johnnie (Tom Hanks) and Daisy (Jennifer Connelly) who are orphaned from a storm at sea. When Daisy meets Johnnie, the two find a kindred spirit who has been lost, and Johnnie begins to teach her the basics of what it means to be a human being. I thought this was a very touching movie that shows Johnnie and Daisy growing up from being two "cute" kids into real human beings, and the journey they go on to figure out who they are.  There are some excellent performances in this film as well, the best acting is definitely from Tom Hanks as Johnnie.  I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it to all viewers of childrens movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's been years since I last saw this movie, and since then it has stayed with me in the most vivid form.  When it was released, most critics described it as cheesy and unoriginal, but they weren't wrong, it's a good cheesy/unoriginal movie.   If you don't like cheesy/original movies (see: American Pie, I Love You Man, Slapstick), then this is one for you, though the script is much more complex than a simple "he stole a girl's car" story.  I love the movie's sense of humor, and it never gets old. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the last film of the trilogy.   This is the first in a trilogy with more than one film of different genres.

I'd also say that it has a certain charm about it.  And the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A lot of fans were disappointed about the ending of "Fantastic Four" - mainly because the good guys were too lame to stop a madman from killing all of humanity. I was happy to see it wasn't a remake of "Rambo," which had the same plot. I'm happy to finally know that the film series isn't over and that they've got more great stories to tell. This movie gives us a glimpse of the future and gives me hope that this film trilogy will come back around again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good flick. It does exactly what it should do, and then some.    It has a little bit of everything: A love story, a political thriller, an action flick, a comedy, a romance, a little adventure, a love letter to a girl who never really got it, and a whole lot of love (that's one thing I've learned about my wife).   As a love story I liked it a lot. It had that wonderful ending. The only negative was the amount of people in the movie. That was an issue for me because I think the point was to take the audience on this journey and not make them sit in one spot. I think if you have that many people you should be making a movie like this: Where the lead couple takes the audience along with them to learn more about their life, love, family, and friendship. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie stars Paul Newman, the great white hope of the American cinematic universe; Newman has won the heart of the youth everywhere, so we expect to find the young and innocent Newman in a pretty place.   We do find young Paul Newman on a white horse, riding through a lush, sunny forest.   His path is blocked by the stables of a wealthy but evil horseman.  He has been kidnapped by the horseman, who then proceeds to kill everyone in sight. Paul Newman has to save the day and find the horse and his riders. I have read all about the movie by now and I don't want to review it because I just found out about it for the first time this morning. But if you haven't seen it, it is a very good movie that everyone should watch.  It is a well shot movie that has good effects.  But it is the story that really keeps me watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a film of the 1950's, and at the same time it's a period piece that perfectly captures that time. It's set in the 1950s, and the story is set in a small town. The town is where most of the story takes place. A big family plays hide-and-seek, or something similar, out in the woods, which is an actual forest and not some kind of place like the movies! The family doesn't get very far in this forest, it's too thick and too scary for them. But there's something about the woods that catches their interest, and eventually they get out. It was a fun time, and I have to say that I think this is the movie that made me fall in love with Halloween.

You know how we like to love someone for the right reasons, despite the fact that they are often completely out of touch with reality.  They're in love with the way you look, what you say, what your shoes say, how you dress, or the way that the movie that you like is being played and the soundtrack that you've just heard.    I know it's probably too late now that I'm 30, but I think I found my favorite love and it's with a man who thinks as I do.

My girlfriend and I did not have high expectations for this movie, and it did not disappoint. This movie is a good thriller with a good plot and some nice visuals. There are also some interesting characters in this movie. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone. A good movie that has a great story and great characters.

The ending also makes you feel good. There are a lot more things to come, and I expect the movie will be in many more theaters in the future.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a good idea. An American who has been living in England since the early 70s finds the time for a little vacation. This is to be a vacation for the sake of his wife, who is being treated at a large English hospital where many American and British doctors work. He wants to make a movie about this and he does it in one of the worst acting performances ever made by a man of his age. This film does not even pretend to be funny. It is just a sad and sadistic movie and it does not give a laugh. It will not make any sense to anyone but most people will not remember it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good, and scary movie, the only downside is that the kids are not afraid, but just run away from the "haunted house" (which is not really a house; it's a big barn), but what a fun movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie interesting. It is really hard to be a true monster slayer if you are a woman, because you have to go and hunt the monsters and the "creature of the night", in a male-dominated society. The monster hunters often are portrayed as the best of the best. Their lives are dangerous and it is hard to live a life like that. In fact, it is pretty interesting to see how these men struggle to find meaning and purpose in a life that is very different from what they thought it would be. If anything, this movie highlights how the world has changed, and that it is not as straightforward as we once thought it was. It also illustrates how humans are becoming increasingly more sophisticated. The human race has evolved from a "cute little beast with claws" that hunted other smaller creatures to a very advanced technological civilization. The technology they had in the original film was primitive, primitive. I don't think the movie was trying to be "grim and gritty". This is a "monster of the nights" story, not a post-apocalyptic story. It just shows the progression of technology.   There are several elements that could be construed as gags. The whole "go with the flow" routine is used fairly often to try and get the monster slayers to loosen up and enjoy their time killing the creature. The movie also goes at least once to the point where the "night creatures" show up at the end, but it is a fairly simple resolution (the hunters don't show up again, and all is well).   The creature design was really pretty good. The creature designs are a little more complex than the previous movie. It was nice to see a bit of more variety in the designs. They seem to be designed for the "cuddly" side of things, like the old Gremlins and the new T-Rex. There is a pretty good balance of "futuristic" and "cuteness". The creature design for the female slayer, was a bit "retro-chic" (which is a good thing, because that was her design in the second movie). I was pleased with the design overall. The slayer was designed really well, and not over-designed. I didn't really see a problem with the slayer's design. I would have liked to have seen her head a bit more streamlined, but that is a small complaint. The female slayers were really

I think the  best and worst parts of this film are the parts where we discover that a former Miss Universe (Goddess Ciara) has a new boyfriend (Gad), and how her dad (Billy Bob Thornton) tries to keep a straight face when he sees that she's been acting crazy.   What is there to be afraid of about Gadd?   She is an absolute delight.

It is a very well acted and acted-for-the-entertainment-of-us movie with a rather silly plot which is funny without being too over the top, and with a few good lines thrown in. The best part of the movie is the ending, which I liked a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The reason I can really recommend this film is that I was able to see something about what the future would look like if we gave a kid an unlimited amount of money. It is a brilliant concept about how the world would change if we all decided that the kid can afford anything he wants to do. So yeah, the movie is very good, and I was glad to see an actor like Michael J Fox back in the screen, making his movie debut in a very funny film.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who has always wanted to see how the future was going to be, but can't because their parents are making sure they don't take money from anyone because if they did then the world will be gone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought a lot about the story of this film.   For me, it was a very emotional movie, and even though I felt this was a big mistake on the part of its director (at least the opening credits) the film was still very moving and did a very good job with a good story and a very sad end.  It also made me feel that there is a lot of hope out there, and it was hard to watch a film that ended with the death of a child, as this was the first time a child had died in front of me in quite a while.  But the most important thing I want to bring to your attention is one particular scene I am so happy about.  I knew in the beginning the film had some great action scenes but I really did not expect to see such great action on such an emotional level as it was presented.  At one point in the film the family is eating dinner (while the baby is screaming).  Then the mother tries to talk to her husband about something.  Suddenly the father is shown in the doorway, and the mother starts screaming.  The next thing we see is the father having a big axe in his hand, and going down the staircase (which is still dark) to get the axe.  There he has the baby, and then the camera comes in on a close up of a headless child (the baby is wearing a pink shirt), and we see the father have the axe in front him and then it just gets darker and darker.  Then it cuts to the mother's face getting cut in half and a knife going through her head.  This sequence is simply incredible, and just gives such an intense and sad ending to a very touching story.  So even though this is not a particularly good film, this is a great ending that I highly recommend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't remember what a bad movie this was, but this movie had my favorite musical number in a musical!   It was just great and made me feel like I was being taken back to that special time in my life, especially when the film was ending.   This was one of those great musicals that made me wish I could go back and change some things, and that there was some type of an official musical to this movie that I could see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a bit of a classic. You will get many laughs, and at the same time, some really bad movies that are worth watching, but, unfortunately, the only thing that keeps it from being an all time classic, is that it lacks any kind of plot. There is one big reveal, the movie is over so fast that you don't really get any closure or any real suspense. It's like that movie where they show the whole movie of the war without any plot, then just cut to the action of the movie...but then they show all the action again later. The ending is also kind of lame, but the movie was really good so maybe that's why it gets a 10. The soundtrack is really good too, and the special effects in the movie are really cool! I just wish I were in the Army, or a pilot instead, so I could see this movie again...and again...
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's nothing else like it:  It was a good summer night at a little movie theatre in New York:  At a recent screening, I had the pleasure of seeing a well-acted, suspenseful, and entertaining film by the director of the recent (and excellent) "Cirque du Freak".  I had never seen anything like it and it has much in common with the "Curse of Chucky" (I'd never heard of this one until I saw it). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am not a movie aficionado. I find it hard to find movies that I enjoy or that I wish I had seen before I got too old to go to the movies. This one is a perfect blend of comedy, romance, family drama, and action. That's not bad right? What makes this an interesting movie for me is the fact that I never knew about the relationship between the parents and that the movie is based on the real life of my friend's uncle. I found it to be fun and amusing to see a child's life play out. I can't wait to see if the movie will get a sequel. I do have one question though: Why didn't the two-year old girl's mother stay home and take care of the little girl? She was probably so upset that she couldn't get along with her father that she would want to stay home. Also, why did they take her to a movie theater? I know that people get mad at adults who take a little girl to a theater but it's not a good idea for an adult to leave a two- year-old unattended at a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I found The Dark Crystal a little creepy, but not nearly as disturbing as some of those movies I remember watching when I was a kid. There were a lot of weird things going on and it felt a little like a movie that was trying to fit the tropes of other movies while trying not to be a direct rip off of them, and it probably failed a bit of the first and most obvious step in trying to be anything other than a movie about a magical land of strange creatures. It had great, dark, creepy music and it was just plain weird, but then again, this is a movie to show how scary your favorite movie can be without the obvious, over the top, cheap tricks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    While I liked all the other great action movies in this trilogy (with a few exceptions like The Matrix Reloaded and Terminator 2: Judgment Day), I must say that I really enjoyed the third installment.  The last act is really well done in my opinion, it really gives this movie a much needed kick-start.   This is also a good introduction to the world of computer movies, and I think it really shows the possibilities of this medium at this point.  In fact, I was surprised at how much more interesting this film was than the first two (though I was expecting the second to be worse).   The film takes place in a cyberpunk metropolis. The main character is a bounty hunter and is hired to take out a bad guy who runs an illegal casino with his brother.  He does a wonderful job and takes down the bad guy just in time. However, the bad guys henchman are more than happy to get a good crack at him.  Once the henchmen get a little too close to his back it becomes a problem, because he can't hide from them.  With just a few moves he gets one of his guys to use his cyborg leg to kick the henchymen in the knees, giving him a chance to escape, where he then goes to find the baddie's brother and try to take him out, but gets into some problems along the way.  However, that is only the first half of the movie. After the escape is a huge chase through the city and the rest of the film is spent on a long scene where the baddies are escaping from the cyberpolice on a bike.  This scene, where the henchaeps are escaping in a bike, is the only time in the whole film where the action really goes in full-on cyber mode.  I found it pretty interesting to watch these bad guys take on a giant motorcycle.  After they get away from the cyborg, they get out of the bike and it is immediately clear they have to change into human form (because they don't know which one to put into the bike when they get caught).  This whole transformation scene is done with a sort of slapstick style, with the bad henchmans trying to figure out which of the new body parts they will be able to fit in.  Fortunately they don 't have to and they are able to put one into the new bike and go.  They then have a run
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was a good action movie that was made in 1968. Not that I would necessarily recommend this to everyone. However, if you are looking for a good fight movie with a good amount of explosions and mayhem to it, then this is the movie for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There was some fun with this film, but it could easily have been a much better one. I wasn't really impressed with the acting, and the dialogue was very stilted. The movie had some good action, but I was kind of disappointed by how it ends. I'd like to see the movie again one day with a better script. I'm hoping to see it in a big movie theater where the lighting is better.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's one of those movies that you think a minute into it, and then after that, you just know you've seen it.   There are a number of reasons for this, and for me the most important has to be the direction.  A couple of years ago, when I first saw it, the original poster had a picture of a woman with a baby and the text "The Mother."   This is exactly what it reminds you of.    The woman is not the mother.  She is the prostitute that was in a position of authority over the child.  The director, Stanley Kubrick,  is an artist and he creates a sense of tension in the film that you don't see in most westerns.  You know that the end is going to come, and you see the end come but you don 't know why.  It has a very strong emotional impact,   and is an interesting look at a very unusual film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a good, old fashioned horror movie about the last man in the world who is a psychic. His powers are limited to the ability to read people's minds (he can only perceive their thoughts) and to communicate with the dead, which he does by holding forth. The movie is not really scary, the scares are real, but it's a very suspenseful, gory and dark little movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am going to go out on a limb and say that this movie is as entertaining as the good old days when there were a bunch of teenagers in black leather clothes hanging out in the streets of Los Angeles and the bad guys were just bad.   It is a fun movie for all ages. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good story with a great director.    The first hour is mostly just the kids going to school.  They are being nice and kind to one another.  When it ends they run into the house of a nice old couple who are dying and will be missed.  This is followed by a long, strange journey through a forest where we don't quite know what to make of things.  The movie never seems to be about anything so the scenes are very disjointed.  The ending is very disappointing as we get a very silly little story with some funny moments but I would have preferred if the kids would not have left the cabin.  There is some pretty good, if a little odd, humor throughout the movie but it can be a bit hard to follow with a little movie like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only problem was that it ended rather abruptly. I understand that it was meant to be a sequel. Yet it didn't do that. Maybe it was supposed to have the hero return to earth, but it didn�t work. We had to wait some time for the sequel to arrive. But the first one could still count as the first movie.   I'd like to tell the director that he's probably going to get a lot of flak for a silly movie like this. Yet for that, I give it a 2/5. (The rating will be updated as the movie progresses.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an American thriller that follows two young sisters, Mollie and Beth from upstate New York who, because they are poor, live in an orphanage and take care of six other kids. It seems from the very beginning that the two girls are destined to be rivals for their mother, who has been the head-teacher at the orphanage for years. That is, until Moll's sister, Beth, shows up and starts competing for their mom. The drama is fast-paced and there is a lot to see and hear, with a good dose of action, too. It is entertaining as it twists around and around and sometimes the suspense is just plain good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember seeing this movie about a decade ago and enjoying it thoroughly.   This movie was released in 1969, and the plot was simple enough:  The young hero, Jim, is an orphan who was raised by a single mother.  His father had left the family when Jim was young, but Jim was determined to become a Marine like his father:  He became a good, solid Marine, and then went to the Naval Academy, then trained with the best.  But then the world went crazy, and Jim's father died, and everyone thought Jim had left his father behind in the world and became a killer.  He was the best of the worst.  A few years later, Jim's brother has gone insane and Jim must take care of him.  After some trouble, Jim and his family move to Los Angeles and Jim takes up as an auto mechanic.  The film is one of the better early action movies and really captures that good feel of the times.  It has some wonderful special effects, which I have not seen since.  Some of the best scenes are the car chase.  When the characters are traveling on the freeway and Jim jumps the curb, you can't help but feel like you are in a time machine.  I really liked this movie and have yet to see anything like it.  And now I wish it had never been made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen more than my share of "dark" movies, but this one, especially the way it started out, was quite a shocker. I suppose the director had already made his bones when he got hired to work with George Lucas on The Empire Strikes Back, but he seems to be getting better and better, and there is nothing I have seen that has matched it for me yet.    "I have no idea what this was about. This is an old science-fiction story which I had long forgotten. It didn't interest me at all, but it's a little creepy. It doesn't really have much action, and is a fairly straight-up comedy. It could well serve as a basis for an episode of the MST3K, but I'm not sure it could stand up to the series that it was supposed to. I hope it gets some love someday."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While I've been a Star Trek fan from the beginning, I did not really realize, until watching this movie, how much I've grown to like and appreciate what I do. It is an interesting story about a man, who works a series of jobs to raise money to help pay his daughter's college tuition. He's not very lucky though because he's a pretty pathetic guy. He has a hard time getting laid and he has a pretty boring job. So he's pretty much miserable. But then, one day a new girl walks into his bar, and the manager of the bar, decides to introduce her to his crew. This new girl, goes by the name of Amanda. Amanda, is very sexy. She has an athletic body, nice long hair and a sexy smile. She's very funny, she is a bit of a tomboy, and she can even dance quite well. So she's a very appealing girl. But, her father, isn't really much of a father figure either. He seems rather old and slow to the point where he may not even be capable of keeping his daughter entertained. So it wasn't pretty clear to me who this girl was at first. But soon after she came to the bar and introduced herself and started dancing, I knew that she was something special. She is a true charmer, who can make a guy feel like she's his girlfriend. The only thing is that she has an attitude. She can be rude and not very nice at times, but she is still an attractive girl. After a lot of nice dances with Amanda, this bar owner, decides that he'll offer this nice girl a job. And so it goes. After taking a little more time off from his job, the owner decides to go home for a while. Amanda then starts having a drink in his bar. Her mother has told her that he doesn't feel very well, so she takes off in her little red car to get some much needed sleep. When she arrives, her dad has apparently taken his little red Mercedes and is sitting in the living room drinking a couple of beers. I don't know about you, but this made me feel really sick to my stomach. I couldn't watch this movie. I turned the volume down and walked out of the movie theater. I was so angry. It just broke my heart to see this horrible father in such a terrible way. I know, I know. The movie, while it is not terribly good

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's main character, Dr. Peter Van de Water (played wonderfully by the ever reliable Richard Kiel), is a highly eccentric Swiss psychiatrist. He is an expert at talking animals and has a penchant for making bizarre comments to those who are brought to him by their owners. But it's Van de Wood who keeps him on the whole time--he's just that amusing. The film was filmed and edited by John K. Reischberg. The story is told by Van de Wall's daughter (Bridget Soubry), who takes her father's place as Dr. Van de Van (or as Dr Van de Wart as she refers to him--it is not really his real name). Dr Van Wart is a charming man who takes his patients out to the hills to help them relax and see that nature is in fact "the answer to everything." The film is set in the late 1930s and early 1940s in Switzerland, where Van de Dr. is a Swiss-born psychoanalyst. The theme of the film is the importance of nature, especially in connection with relationships, and the ways in which nature's healing qualities are overlooked in the modern world, and even by some psychiatrists.

While a beach is an idyllic place, it has its fair share of dangers, such as waves washing people away.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I first watched The Manchurian Candidate I was a little wary about it. My own memory of the movie had faded years ago (I think I saw it in a public high school cinema) and I thought the movie was more or less the kind of low-budget, low-quality exploitation film that often shows up in those days to see if people would go along with a movie. I did not go along and didn't even enjoy it very much. The movie was a combination of many elements I didn't like and a lot I did, although not in the way the movie makers intended. At first I felt that we were in a typical CIA movie that shows the way for an enemy to get us to do our dirty work. Of course, that was not the case at all. It was far more sinister and far more convincing than I had first imagined. I had been warned, however, that The Manchinueber Candidate wasn't a good idea if you are watching a big screen in front of a huge crowd at a high school. And so we were. We were in the middle of a high-school drama, a drama that was supposed to be a high point of the entire year. We had been all over the place as a group, and it was wonderful. Now we were back at the school's big event, and the movie seemed to be more about the school drama than about the CIA plot. The manchurians are the worst, and they have taken over the school, and now they will kill all the girls! Of course the movie does not include the scenes from the "dramatic" movie that was going on, but I thought it was worth showing just to show just how the CIA gets people to do things for them.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So, after years of watching horror movies, I started to think about trying to watch a good one. I thought about it for a long time.   I didn't like the first few movies I saw, and I still don't. But one night, a friend of mine and I went to an independent movie theater. There, in the second row (of movies), was "The Innocents," and I fell in love with it. It is a story of a group of children who were kidnapped and used for occult rituals.  The girls are all in high school. One of them is a pretty redheaded girl who is trying to keep up with her friends. She is actually good at it.  They have a "sister." Her name is Anna and she is a very strong minded girl who actually doesn't care much for the ritualistic stuff that is going on. She doesn't like that she is being told to do it by a sadistic psychopath who makes her do things like wear a dog collar.  The other girls don't like Anna. She's very independent and is a lot less nice than the others.  I love the music in this movie. It was beautiful. I think I like it a lot more than the first one I saw.  This is a great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What a great movie! It's like the old time movies where you are on your way to the moon (the moon!) while on earth you are doing other things (the earth, the plants).  It's about a man trying to get back to his hometown which has been destroyed by a meteorite (more on this later). But his journey is a bumpy ride for sure:  The plot is really very simple:   One thing leads to another and the result is an epic movie about a meteor hit, meteorites, the man trying get to his home, the woman trying to bring back the man back and lots of other interesting things that can only make a good story even better.  The art is really nice:  When I'm trying to describe the art of this movie to someone who didn't quite understand it when I saw it I would say that it has a strong and simple style and it's all set on top of each other.   The sound:  I really like the sound effects and voice acting. The music is good too:  I think that it's more than what I would expect from a movie by this director.  The acting is just fantastic:  We have very good performances with some of the biggest names from the movie (Harrison Ford, Tom Skerritt, Kevin Bacon).   This is a great addition to the collection of old timey movies:  To all of us who didn't see it back in 1982 when it came out, this movie was simply great:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To get back to my point, The Matrix, one of the great science fiction movies ever made, was an unmitigated disaster on every conceivable level. When the film started, I thought: 'I like this movie; it's a thriller,' and was so wrong. The 'plot' is pure junk: there is a big battle in which a robot kills a bunch of people using his arm, which then explodes and hits a wall, and then some guy named Neo is a cyber-agent fighting the robots in some sort of robot-fighting ring or something. The battle is really bad: the action scenes are so bad (the robots are made of clay, and Neo is on a giant, moving, metal throne, in a cave filled with all kinds of horrible stuff that would be considered 'unpleasant' by today's standards). And then the film goes on to be a very bad story about Neo, whose only purpose seems to be to talk and fight the robots. (He isn't very good at either, but he's a little more 'cool' than the robots seem to be. It's also not very long, though it tries to be, though I think it's just too long for something like this to have any sort of meaning. This is, after all, a movie about the future, in which robots are a major problem and have to be destroyed or controlled in any way possible. That's the message, anyway.) I haven't seen a good film in a long time. I haven?t seen any good films in a very long time, as a matter of fact. This one seemed really'realistic'; I suppose it was an attempt to create some of the more outlandish sci-fi of the early '80s. I still don't know what a movie like this could be about. I think there's a message here, but it is lost in the confusion. I wish they had left out the whole movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that this might have been the most fun I've had with a movie in a very long time.   It's funny, it's moving, and you get a good sense that the cast knows exactly what they are doing.  I also loved it when the director said, "I'm gonna let you in on a secret: I do this because I want to."   And so it went.  A very high-quality movie about one guy trying to make his dreams come true.

There's a bit of slapstick, a good amount of campy fun. It's a good fun, but not a good horror movie, I guess. If you're looking for good, scary horror movies that don't come with the usual cliches: a mysterious malevolent entity, an invisible force that manipulates the dead and a man who has never been to the underworld, then you've found the right movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the best examples of a good script was the screenplay of The Blackcoat's Daughter, which was written by the late Peter Weir. I do not think it is possible to write a better book than this one, which shows all the signs of an exceptional story. The plot is simple: an author (a "Blackcoat", a former spy) is called back to spy again. But there is something strange about her book, as if she was a spy herself. There are a lot of hints about her past - the "Blackcoats" were a group of ex-British Secret Service agents, which were recruited by General Sir Percy Cox, and were the first British people to find themselves trapped in a Nazi occupied Russia (a theme that would reappear in many other films). This is how the film begins: a girl named Svetlana (Gina Lollobrigida), who has always been interested in the mysteries surrounding her past. She begins to uncover many of her pasts and discovers a series of murders. Eventually, she finds her way into a mysterious world of crime which seems to be connected with the author - a strange woman called Anna (Mina Malaya). The Blackcoats are a mysterious group of young ladies who fight a war against the Red Army, but are only interested in a certain "golden hair" (as they say in Russian). One of their first missions involves an author who lives in a village where the inhabitants are under strict Nazi control, but she manages to escape. One day, Anna has to go to the village to talk to her friend, the author, and make sure she returns safe and sound. But the Nazi guards, led by Captain Savenko, are waiting for her. Anna gets a chance to escape and manages to make her way to Berlin, where she finds out the truth about the Blackcoat's. But before she can reveal any secrets, she is arrested by the German secret service and sent to the gulag - which she manages not to return from. Svetalana soon realizes that her love for reading has been a mistake, and she tries to get away from the Blackcoat world. But she can't keep away - she can never leave them. When the girl begins to change, she begins to find that her feelings for Anna are stronger than her love of her country. She soon learns the reason for the BlackCoats' actions. Sveta (Gloria Stuart) is a beautiful
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film from the 70's.   I am always impressed by the originality and creativity of a good story.  The story is simple, but it is executed very well.  A young couple is walking down the streets when a car runs them over and the two are buried in the same grave.  From there the film goes on.  We learn that one of the victims was a wealthy man from Philadelphia who happened to be killed by a drunken driver on his motorcycle.  His wife is pregnant.  He and his wife decide to drive to Chicago and give birth to their first child.  Unfortunately, the child doesn't survive the journey so the couple make the first of many trips to Illinois.  In Chicago the woman decides to give the baby to her sister so that she can take care of the baby's father.  They are all good people, even though there is some tension between them and it is clear that they have a strong marriage.  I don't know much about the husband, but I know that he is a lawyer and that there is a lot of family drama happening.  This makes for a good family drama, but the only bad thing I can say about the film is that the actors play their roles extremely well. If you have a good memory and you enjoy a good time with your family, watch this film and you will be happy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this is a movie which will stick with me for a long time to come.  It has a pretty good plot.  The characters are interesting.  There is a decent amount of violence which is a bit much.  However it isn't to all, as it is set a long long time ago.   There are a lot of historical facts.  What makes this movie very good is that its set in the mid 18th century and it has been made for the movie-goer who is looking for something good, and not just another boring historical film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie from start to finish.  From the first scene with Michael Fassbender in his "Black Mass" tuxedo and a nice shirt, to the final shot of him on a street corner in a red dress singing to a crowd, it all felt so right.  If you like the Black Mass, you will like this movie even more.   A good movie, a must see.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'd never heard of the "Borges" movies before.  They made sense to me.    The movies follow a classic story, "The Library of Babel" (The Man Who Could Not Write),  in which a genius attempts to decipher the entire English language, which is filled with thousands of words but no one is able to translate them.  You don't need a degree in linguistics to understand the movie, but if you can, check it out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you enjoyed The Wicker Man you'll love this one:  It's one of those strange and wonderful things when a great, weird movie about a man who wears a wicker mask comes out into the open and is the sort of movie that doesn't matter and never will:  One of the most charming things about the WickerMan is that it manages to be very moving, weirdly funny, but still very real:  I like that it's set in the 1930s, but it's not about a 1930s movie set in a 1930's town:  For one thing, the sets look like they're in the 1970s (a fact that is made clear by the fact that the WingerMan is played by Robert Mitchum), yet they still feel like they could be right out of that era:  A lot of people have accused the Wickers Man of being a spoof of The Wizard of Oz:  In fact, it's the reverse. It isn't an overly magical movie:   What we're looking at here is a very human film, very funny (and, most of the time, genuinely funny) and utterly bizarre:  And it's a great example of an original film that's still going strong even after the fact:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a great movie. The actors were great! I didn't think the plot was all that bad. I found myself laughing a lot, although the plot is a bit silly.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a nice movie. It had lots of humor and a great theme song which was nicely done. It is a great story with a great ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a true story:  A man called "Emanuel" is a good guy.  He's a carpenter, a nice man and a really good friend.  His wife is also very good with him.  Emanuel is a real good guy who believes in a better tomorrow - a future where everybody does everything together.  But he has one major problem.  One day he gets a note saying he is not to appear in the city tomorrow (the note, written by his wife's brother, is actually addressed to Emanuel and to another, unknown, man, who also gets his last name incorrectly spelled).  He doesn't even know why his name was put on the notice - it seems to be a family dispute...  In the meantime, his wife is very ill and at the hospital, Emanuel, having lost hope, meets another doctor (one of her old nurses), who takes his wife to the next town (the one Emanuel knows).  The next day, Emanuel comes back to the same place to look for his wife.  As he's leaving, another nurse approaches him, telling him that her mother is in bad health and is too ill to come to the hospital anymore.  "You're my only hope," Emanuel is told.  A few days later, at Emmanuel's place, the nurse's father appears.  The father, a man in his 70s, has the same bad luck as his mother - and he too has fallen ill.  All around them, the good guys are dying - Emanuel's brother is in the same situation, and the nurses' father also has bad health.  Meanwhile, a mysterious old man approaches Emanuel, offering him money (money he has no need of) to find his wife - money that can be used to give his father a proper burial.  When the old man takes out his wallet, Emanuel thinks it is just a joke; but when the man pulls out two money-bags and gives him a piece of paper with a note in it, Emmanuel's life changes forever.   So, when we see Emanuel go in the forest, we should not be surprised to see the old woman with the stick (a symbolic figure of the mother spirit, and one who has no love for Emanuel) and the man with his father.  These are all representations of the people in the village who feel lost in the fog of the past and the future.  They can't really come up with an answer to

It had a real-life inspiration; the man who founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Joseph Smith. And all the important historical figures, such as the Prophet, were portrayed as normal people. It was a good story and a good film. A definite thumbs up on this movie. Rating:
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are in to some good action movies, don't miss this one. It doesn't really have the style of an action flick. It has a more laid back and realistic feel to it, it is definitely fun for the whole family to watch. I really like this movie and it is very good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good, very well acted movie (for a small, independent movie about something very silly) about a girl who moves from England to France where the man who saved her from a drowning accident at sea is trying to locate her brother. It looks like this one is going to get good ratings, but at this point I feel it should be rated lower than it will go.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a good old horror movie with good acting by all the actors, a good story, a simple plot and a lot of suspenseful scenes and suspenseful twists.  It has the perfect blend of horror and thriller.  But as always with horror movies it leaves you scared, but not quite sure if you need to see it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was not aware that the movie was called "I am an idiot" (like "I had a ball" or something along those lines). Anyway, the movie is about a retarded old man who's son is killed in the car accident. He doesn't know who he is and he's just an idiot. But I really liked the movie. It was a funny movie. Not funny like some other movies I've seen, but just good. The film didn't have a good ending, but I could not remember if they got off the bus. I guess the whole movie just sort of happened.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those rare movies where all the main characters really live up to their titles. The story is really good, all the characters are likable and you feel so bad for the protagonist and the whole town when all the kids are sick and the only doctor is a guy named Mr. Woz. If you like science fiction, you won't want to miss this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very enjoyable comedy that is full of heart!   The film is the story of a young girl that is obsessed with a famous Japanese cartoonist.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about a man who doesn't know he is crazy. His wife, the wife of his doctor, is having an affair and they decide to keep it a secret from the rest of the family. But when the affair is exposed, the man finds himself in a predicament. His father, the president of the country has been shot in the back by a woman who was hired to kill him. The only way to save the country is for the man, a lawyer, to stop the women from killing someone else. The women in question are the daughter of an old man, who doesn´t know he´s mentally handicapped. The daughter, who has the mental capacity of an adult, has been having an incestuous affair with her father. And the father, who is a lawyer is now forced to go on a personal vendetta against the daughter.    This is one hell of a movie. I liked it. I loved it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bruno Forzani's The Life of David Gale was a good little movie about a very odd little man. Forzane is a man who is in constant pain due to an operation he underwent back in the 1940s which resulted in the amputation of one leg below the knee. One of the reasons Forzante can't quite get over the amputations is that he's never quite able to walk without falling over. When his girlfriend, a former dancer, marries a rich man and moves to Paris with him (a decision Forzabe can hardly believe) she starts taking him to the best places around the city, and he feels this was a deliberate act of betrayal. I'm sure that when the two meet in Paris they'll find that there's plenty of time to get over what's happened to Forzano since his life has become a bit more normal. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      A good movie about the great man in black.   My 2cents:  I had just finished watching John Huston's classic The Great Dictator and thought it was one of the best movies ever made.  I hadn't really seen any of Huston movies but his films always appealed to me.  It reminded me of movies like True Stories of American Gangsters.  A good, entertaining film.  I have to ask:  What is with people who have nothing better to do than to go to bars and have fun?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good old-fashioned tale of a group of men who are hunting a bad guy.   As the name of the movie suggests, it deals with a group who are on a journey to kill and remove a very bad guy from the earth.    It is a very well directed movie.  It has the look and feel of a cowboy western.  The music in this film is great.  I like all the western films in that style. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a genre of movies that seem to only make their way into multiplexes, I'm surprised that a movie with a real emotional impact has not already been released in theaters.   If you were one of those kids that watched the original Star Wars: Episode I as a child, there is no doubt that your memory of the first movie still remains vivid.  In this movie you get to see how this new generation of scientists are building a new ship that has the capability to travel to another solar system with minimal damage.  When you first see the movie you think it will be a typical space adventure and you are wrong.  If there is a flaw in this movie it is the fact that the original actors don't do their best, but still they do their job and bring the characters to life.  The ending, although brief and a bit forced, does provide a satisfying conclusion to an interesting movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was introduced to this movie in a school movie. As a kid, that was a really strange movie. If you think about it, it has nothing to do with anything else; and it doesn't really get anywhere. It has a female doctor who runs a clinic and treats patients who are in a coma (as in the movie). The patients are in that state because they have had their brains removed and placed in a jar. (I don't remember if they actually called the brain jar the brain because it is in the same box in the trailer.) The clinic also has a room in which you can examine the patients if they don't speak. The patients speak, and they are all quite funny. There's a few jokes, and one of them has the woman taking a bath in a sink full of water, and she is still in a bad state because she has been drugged and her head was put inside a jar and placed next to the woman's head. The clinic is filled with strange-looking medical machines. One of them is an ouija board, which means, I guess, that it's an instrument to get messages out to the dead. Well, apparently the patients are also capable of reading messages. The doctor is trying to communicate with them, and the messages are in Spanish. The only thing that I really noticed is that the doctor's clothes change. It's as though they've got something on top of them, or the clothes were too short. I was also surprised how many of them were older than the others. And the last one was quite a good looking girl. I wish I had seen this movie at the theater when it was on, because it had a very strange and eerie look about it. I'm not even sure if I saw it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My friends and I loved this movie very much. We really liked the story line of the characters, even though it was a somewhat clichéd, somewhat stupid movie. We like our heroes smart, but we don't like our villains stupid. This movie is full of wonderful things, even the acting was great, though it's just a lot of kids acting like they're kids. I thought it was very clever.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've had my eyes on This Must Be the Place for a while now. I always wanted a shot at writing a review. This film was a hit with me. I really loved it. It didn't have that "good-bad" quality which made so many other films such a disappointment. I didn't find any glaring errors but there is a whole new direction in which the director is taking the story. It's not a bad direction and it doesn't try to be all things to all people. All of the character are not bad. This is a film about a man who wants nothing more than to be loved by a woman (that he has a crush on) who is a teacher. It is about a lot of things, love, anger, family, religion, death, etc. This must be the place is a good film with lots of good acting. It has a great soundtrack by John Williams. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a shame we have to go through yet another story about a family that comes together to get their son out of a mental institution, but there they are, in the end - or, at least, in some form of it. The story itself is a little odd, involving some of the characters we have seen before, and it takes a good deal of patience to get through it. And yet, once through it is a wonderful movie that is certainly worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie shows that there are more than two sides to every coin - that the world needs a more sophisticated and more ethical public servant than we have in Washington - and that the Democratic Party has no reason to take the nomination away from a more serious candidate. But that does not mean it is not worthwhile to make a movie that shows the real world we live in. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be frank, I do not enjoy horror movies.  I can understand that some people really enjoy them.  They are scary as all get out,  but in my opinion,  they are not really scary at all.  My problem with horror movies, is that you never really know what is going to happen when you turn the next corner.  But, I think the actors were all very good.  If you like films like The Shining and The Exorcist, or horror movies of the kind that come out every couple of years or so, this is a good one.  It has a lot of jump scares and really scary moments.  There are two different endings which will appeal to the viewers of both movies. I would recommend this to any movie fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't have a high expectation of this movie, but I do have a huge amount of respect for the creators. This movie was made in 1988, a long time ago in the cinema business and in another world. There's a lot of talk in this movie about a group of teenage losers who meet each other by chance and end up playing a game called "Skee-Ball". It's a funny movie that tells its story in a realistic way. What makes it stand out is the way it presents its characters. It also contains a lot about life in a small town and the characters' own personalities.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was a great piece of comedy. It's about a dog who decides to go for a swim in a lake. He swims up and down until he finds a small island with a waterfall down it and the dogs decides to jump in after him. The other dogs think that the man who lives on the island is a mean drunk and so they try to make him drunk with a bunch of things. There are some great one liners and funny parts. I would recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To put it mildly, the story line in this movie is pretty interesting. The action, though not very thrilling, isn't bad. The whole thing is based around a group of people trapped in a small house. At one point, when they are trying to escape, the house explodes, setting off the same fire that started the fire which then spreads to the other houses which explode and so on. It makes the story come alive, especially the part where the house goes up in flames. This movie is all about the characters, and I like them. They are funny and well rounded. I also like that the movie has a lot of humor. The movie isn't great, but it is entertaining and it doesn't require that you be a great fan of the book to enjoy it. The book is short, but that doesn't seem to be an issue to me. I'll probably have a movie of this one in the near future.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent, entertaining little movie, about a little girl and her family who are travelling to India. Unfortunately the family gets lost, and they wander around the desert all day before finally being caught by a bad guy who is also running around the same desert, trying to catch the family. However, he is unsuccessful, because the little girl is clever enough to turn her body into a balloon which she floats away on. And then the bad guy, the Indian bad guy (played with comic good looks by an actor called James Mason), comes along and the bad guys chase the family through the desert for a while, until the family is able to get back into the car and drive away. I didn't quite understand the idea of chasing them through the sand until about the end, when, by a very clever device, they are able to drive off.   The whole movie is very funny and funny characters. The girl is obviously a child, but she has very clever ideas about how to get out of trouble. She is able at the last to get a little ball out of her body, and turn it into a very, very thin umbrella which she throws at the baddie and bounces off, so that the baddies can't catch the little child.     Then, the family arrive at the riverbank, where a pretty damsel approaches them and asks for their help. Unfortunately she wants to go to India and take a boat up to Bombay, but her father thinks it is all nonsense. But the family take her up on their offer. But it is very much a one way journey.   of course the family get lost at the Indian side of the river. The little girl turns herself into a boat and she bounces across to the Indian bank. But then she turns back into a little thing again and bounces back to the little island. And so on.   in the end she reaches Bombay, and she is able not only to catch a train up to the British Consulate, but also to buy a car for herself.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be completely honest, I did not like this movie. I'm not saying it is awful, because it wasn't. Not bad at all; there's some very good scenes in it. But I didn't really care for anything that was happening, not the characters, not anything. I feel like I should have been paying more attention to the dialogs and more to the acting. I couldn't follow the story at all. It felt like it was a made for TV movie rather than a good film. The actors seem to be a good group. But if you're not a big fantasy lover, then you're going to be left wanting by it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was very well done. I thought the movie wasn't bad. I do think it was a little bit too long. If they had kept it under three minutes, I think it would have worked much better. I think the movie really needs a sequel, maybe next year. There are some parts of the movie that are too sad. I feel this is why it is rated a PG. I liked this movie, but maybe next time they should just not give it so long. It is an interesting and well-made movie. I will try not to be sad when I finish watching this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My only complaints with this movie are that the ending is way too long and confusing for a PG-13 movie; that the movie never seemed to really go anywhere; that I feel like I'm being sold a movie to watch over and over again when, frankly, the movie had a lot of good ideas but it was all a little too complicated; that a little more blood would have been nice; and also that I just kind of want my money back! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me, it's like "The Exorcist", but with more blood.  The film starts out with a girl being raped, and then is brought back to life by a magic wand.  As she gets into it, she soon finds herself in the house of a woman called "Lady Gyn".  The first thing she says is, "Are you pregnant?"  After a while, her father, Lord Gyn, comes into the house to find his daughter in bed with a young man called 'Dick' (who's clearly the brother of the lady he's raped).  A bit of sleuthing soon finds out that Dick is a magician, and he is using an enchanted wand to cause people's blood to freeze.  This doesn't last long, and Lord Gwyn, who's now possessed by Lord Glynwyn, is able to escape, to tell his wife he must leave.  Glyn is furious at his father, and is trying to persuade her that "his" Dick is actually his son, and his daughter has killed his brother.  Lady Gwyn seems to think that her husband doesn't like Dick very much, and wants him to leave, but he replies that he doesn't want to leave Glyn either, as she is like his mother in a sense.  So they decide that Dick will kill his father the next day, and Glyn will be a sacrifice.  But the real reason that they do this is to get rid of Glyn's spirit, so they can have Lord Gylwyn back to live again.  It's very sad, and it's a little silly to try and make this a good film:  It is silly, it is silly.  In fact, this is one of the many silly things in this movie.  Lord Gys is an old man, and one of his first actions when he is possessed is to ask Glynwydd how old his daughter is:  "I don't know, she's so young."  Well, how old is his daughter?  It seems she is 14.  How old is her father?  He's 78 years old, and the first thing he wants to do when he's possessed is kill himself.  Then he asks where Dick is, and Dick tells him that he's in the wood working in the fields.  I have to point out something about how people die in this film:   When the old wizard Glyn tells G
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's hard to believe that the same writer behind The Dark Knight Rises is responsible for this gem of a movie.   This is a simple story about a guy and a girl who have a baby. The girl is so beautiful that she inspires in him a lot of fear. This fear turns into a kind of love when the girl gives him his first "love" - a real man, a soldier.  In the next scene the boy and girl are sitting together.  I found it hard to watch. A simple story where a simple action is turned into a masterpiece of cinematography. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very funny movie which has a very positive story with a funny lead as a young girl who goes to live with her grandparents.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The premise of this movie is to tell the story of a guy and his girlfriend who meet in a gas station, and later they fall in love and decide to move in together.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only thing that could have made this movie better is the fact that they would have had to include a bunch of scenes of the characters getting into a heated fight with each other, but I guess if you do a lot of fighting with your legs and elbows the whole thing doesn't seem so bad.   "I'm a faggot!"   This scene is pretty funny as a lot more often than not you find "faggot" as a slang term meaning "a weakling or a loser" but this phrase is most often used in the gay community.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is an absolute classic. For those who've seen it and loved it (like me) will love it once again. The story is simple: a lone, depressed man takes a bus from his home in Brooklyn to a friend's place, only to find that her husband has gone missing. After searching the area, he is able to find clues that lead him to his missing husband, who has been taken off to a military school in the state. The film is shot at an interesting angle, giving a look at the man from his perspective. The movie is told from a third person point of view, so we can't read the character's mind. The man is depressed, but he is not as simple as a simple guy from Brooklyn. He tries to make friends and build a normal life, but it's hard to make a life where no one is willing to spend a bit of money to be friends with a depressive. He also has a dog, a cocker spaniel, who he calls the "dumb dog". It's a bit silly, but the film isn't intended to be silly. It's intended to show the depressing reality of the time we live in. It is an interesting look at a time in American history that still is shocking today.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've always wanted a really good horror film so I was pretty pumped when I heard that there was a remake. I thought it had a good cast, a great set-up and some good scares. I don't really remember any of the story except I think the main character is a guy who was bitten by a werewolf and then turned into a wolf.  The Werewolves of London   The film was shot back in the 60s so there was some good makeup used by the makeup artists.   I only had a couple of scenes with the main cast so I can't speak to how they performed but I did like the little kid with a big mouth.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was never a huge science fiction fan, but I'm glad I saw this one. It wasn't terrible, and it wasn't anything special. It's not one of the best, but there's plenty of good sci-fi out there, and a few bad ones too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is not much wrong with this movie, I like that this film was shot and directed by Steven Spielberg, a true legend in the genre. It does what it set out to do and that is to tell a good story, and Spielberg does a good job. Spielberg does not use special effects so much as he is a great director and can show us a true story with a bit of comedy mixed in. His actors are all great too with an important cast of good, bad, and ugly. I have watched this movie a lot, it was made in 1983 and I feel it is still a good film from that year. The acting is excellent throughout. The movie does take a good amount of liberties from the source material but it does not break the story or feel unoriginal. It is well made and entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    While the movie is not great, but not horrible either, it's a comedy. I found myself laughing a few times while it was playing. I did laugh when the lead character went "Well that's it, I'm moving on." He must of had a good laugh at himself as he went, well, it just goes to show what a terrible loser he is. He does not know how to act in front of a group of young people in front an audience of millions. He doesn't even know how much to act, he just stands in front a group and talks, then looks at the audience which isn't something he's ever done before. I didn't laugh so much because it was a bit of a run-on sentence (no pun intended) but I also didn't find the dialogue funny. The film was very funny and good-natured, I have no complaints. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you enjoy movies that are really hard to make, then you will like this one. It is very well made and even the most dedicated and well meaning viewers will get a kick out of it. The acting is great, the plot makes no sense, and even if it did it wouldn't be very hard to tell why.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the story of a gangster who is a pretty good guy.  He doesn't wear flashy suits and have a mustache and tie, he drives a white van and is a little scrawny.  He is a good guy, just like the rest of them.     The story isn't about how he became a bad guy, it is about how the world went to hell, and he went on to become one of the good guys.  I have seen movies like this before.  The plot of this film is not that original, but the characters are so great that it is hard to find a fault with this film.  It is based on a real gangster, and that character's personality fits the film perfectly.  And the fact that this is the final film by director Martin Scorsese does not hurt either.  This is a great film that captures the atmosphere of an old fashioned Chicago gangster flick.  Posted by Kevin at 7:25 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:   (I hope we get to see the director again...)   I can't recommend the movie.   This film has a plot that has the potential to be good...but it's always a mess.  As the story goes, some kind of alien invasion is going to happen, but, since the President of the U.S. is not around, he has to call a meeting to discuss it. Everyone wants to have a say on the matter.  When the UFO lands, a man named Bobbie (Tommy Lee Jones) has some very strange dreams about it. So strange that, upon waking up, he thinks he is a boy named Bob, who went with a friend to the "UFO camp". What does Bobbie know? Why he is dreaming about aliens? It is time for him to meet "the other Bob" to find out.  The film is a disaster from the beginning to the end, but it is hard to say why. If it weren't so unbelievable, it might be funny.  It is hard for me to explain this film in a single review. If you want to see it, then keep reading. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is probably the best film about two teenagers living in the suburbs (even if their parents are in on the whole thing). The first half of the film tells the story of a very sweet and normal young boy in the first years of high school (who, I imagine, would get more and more depressed as he gets closer to middle school). He and his buddy get into quite a few fights and even have some run-ins with the police. A friend of the boys' father comes to see their games at school (one of the most famous video games in the U.S. market is called "Battle Arena"), and it becomes a competition between the boys and his own son (a boy who plays video games and has a large head and hair). They both do well in the game (or at least most of them do), and eventually the two sons get to know each other better. They get into some serious trouble with a girl (she is the most attractive girl I've ever seen), and they spend a good part of the movie laughing, talking, and even having an orgy. It's a good, funny movie. The best part is that the film does a superb job of showing kids not behaving like kids--they become adults by the end of the story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this on video once before, and it was so boring! I had to watch this again last week for some comedy. I am not sure where to start with this movie. I liked the character of the wife. I felt sorry for her. She was a good girl. I did not feel sorry for the boy, because he was not a bad person. The kid could have been a little bit more smart and he could have got some help, but he wasn't a bad kid. I think it is unfair for the family to not give help to the kid. So, it was not the end of the world that the boy couldn't stay at school. It was just an accident. I wish this movie came out when I was in grade school, and I can imagine the whole family watching it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was looking forward to this one. I like how each of the three characters is different and the twist at the end was great! It made the movie so much better too.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For the life of me, I can't figure out why Hollywood decided to remake one of the greatest movies ever made: The Shining.   The original film was produced by and starred Jack Nicholson (who still can't seem to get any work in Hollywood anymore), and while the film certainly had its faults (the soundtrack was awful, Stanley Kubrick decided to kill off his wife and son in front of everyone, and the acting was just atrocious), it still remains one of America's most iconic pieces of cinema.  The remake isn't really a remake at all, however.   It is essentially a rehash of the plot of the original film, with an almost laughable amount of plot twists and turns that almost seem impossible for the main characters.  For someone who enjoyed the original, the remake is actually kind of disheartening.  However, even if you have only watched the original at all (or even worse, seen it only on home video), I can confidently say that this film is an unqualified classic that should be considered by all horror fans to be one of their first favorites.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It took me a long time to find a film that I could love. I was always a sucker for the classic film noir, which, at that time, was primarily made by American actors (although there were plenty of Italians who appeared in them as well). My first experience with it was a great disappointment. But the reviews were very positive and I was determined to find out what had happened. The plot seems to me like nothing more than a cleverly conceived plot to attract the female audience and attract the attention of the public. What it actually does is to provide a perfect case study on why the female movie-going public (at least those in the big cities and towns) should not go to film festivals or theaters. The fact that the films are so short (in the range of 10 to 20 minutes) and the short films are made for entertainment purposes only (and do not represent the best in movie making) gives rise to the impression of a form of pure, mindless vulgarity. As an example of the last film, The Lady in the Launderette which was produced a couple of years ago: the director, Walter Hill (who is known in the U.S. for creating one of the most memorable horror films of all times, The Devil's Backbone) uses nothing but fast cutting in order to produce what is, in many respects, a cheap but still effective piece of entertainment. And the plot: (a man goes to get a haircut and comes across a lass that he falls in love with, who is a prostitute). This is not a very novel plot. In fact it is an idea that is not unusual in the literature and cinema. And what's the real advantage? It is pure, unadulterated, unpretentious, yet vulgar. The only benefit to this story of a lonely and sad guy who, despite all the odds against him, gets a new friend: a prostitute! One could add a few more elements to the plot but in the film it is so very, very simple. You could substitute the woman for a guy and the story would still be just as bad. The problem with Hill's film is that it doesn't really offer up a lot of substance either. It is a simple plot in which the characters are almost interchangeable. And as far as the plot itself is concerned, there is nothing to be gained by the audience going to see it. This is one of those films that just comes out of the box.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It isn't a bad movie, but it is the kind of movie where it is really hard to be impressed, at least in the beginning.  The actors and crew are all doing a good job, and the set looks great.   There is some pretty good comic elements to the story - a young doctor (Paul Reiser) goes into the field of neurosurgery and has a little trouble with people who don't like him because of his unusual haircut. I think the most unique thing about this movie is that it isn't about one person, but about many. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like the theme of this movie: the relationship between a wife and husband, and a young man who seems to be trying so hard to be like his father. It is sad that this family seems to lack something, because I think there are so many good things in it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first two acts of this movie are great! It takes the time to get you into the right frame of mind to get into a good groove with the movie. It starts out with this beautiful piano melody and it goes into a great groove. It doesn't do that much but it keeps you going. It then has some really cool action sequences, not to mention some really bad ones. The movie just kind of drags along. I don't know how it will end but the whole thing does seem to be going nowhere. The ending is just really sad. The only real redeeming factor is the song that plays at the end, it is quite good. I wouldn't want to watch this movie again but if you like the piano melody you will probably enjoy this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been a big fan of J.C. Chandor's work for quite some time (even before I saw the brilliant American television series) so when I saw this film at the local film festival in Los Angeles, I was really excited.  I was pleasantly surprised by how great it looked; it was shot with an old fashioned feel that didn't feel rushed at all.   It also looks like it was created with the help of a great cameraman with the ability to create such an interesting effect on the audience.  The cast was also very good; I was especially fascinated by the role of  Samantha, which was filled with so much wit, sarcasm, and charm.  It was very interesting to see two people who clearly loved each other in the film and I'm sure they would have kept the relationship going a long time had they not been caught up in their work.  But, as I said, Chandor is a master at his craft.  He really made a memorable movie and I look forward to watching it again on a big screen.  If you like classic Hollywood, have a little fun and a good laugh then give this movie a try.  And if you like movies about very good looking people in very funny situations then this is a great film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After a very interesting movie with some of my favorite actors. I will try to explain this film to others as well. I must mention that one of the scenes in this film was especially memorable to me. That scene was where the wife and child ran into a swamp and were separated. The daughter wanted to get to the cabin to get a better look at her father and father wanted to escape from the swamp, because he was not allowed to run away from the place that he had always wanted to visit. When he got to the swamp he saw several dead people and when he asked his daughter to come with him he was told to go back to the place. This made him mad and to stop the mad man from getting to the cabins he turned the swamp into a river which he then walked in, the girl tried to climb a tree, and he grabbed the girl by the neck and threw her down the tree to his death. Now this may seem ridiculous, but to a person with my imagination (or those of a similar nature) this sounds like a pretty good movie, at least for me. I am glad I tried this movie. I would like to see it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those of you who have only seen one or two of the movies directed by Tim Burton, I implore you to try them all:     "Including the original movie, The Nightmare Before Christmas"   Tim Burton is one of the most respected and successful filmmakers of modern times. Not to be confused with the Tim Burton film The Nightmare before Christmas (1973), which is a Christmas comedy; The Nightmare After Christmas is a darker, more darkly themed comedy.   The story follows the three orphan children (Liv Tyler, Dan Aykroyd and Gene Wilder) who try to survive Christmas Eve in the backwoods of Michigan.  While there they find themselves trapped in a haunted house, where they must defeat a terrifying witch (played by Kristin Scott Thomas) and prevent her from eating their house. The three film make the three main characters very well-rounded, and this is reflected in the cast. It's a real joy to watch them laugh, dance and generally have a good time with each other, even though they are a very young age.

The movie follows a man who's wife has just had a baby, so he decides to do something about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was surprised and enjoyed this movie. It has an interesting idea and a good story that is well executed. It is not the prettiest movie that I have seen. There are a few times in the movie when you are disappointed. The story seems incomplete. When they did the voice over the characters were just not in the right places to give a convincing performance. I don't know how the writer managed to get it all done in time for the movie to be completed, but that is fine. The movie is certainly better than the story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved it!   This is a great old west film.   It is set in the great American wilderness of the 1880s.  There is a lot of humor, adventure, and beautiful cinematography.  The story is a true western classic: a man (or a group of men) goes into the wild to recover a stolen horse.  They get lost in the woods for quite a while before they finally find a camp and a campfire (which is actually a tent) near the trail where the horse is now kept.  However, the horse's rider is not there, and the horse has run off, and only his bridle and collar are left.  In order to retrieve the saddle and harness and saddle, the rider needs to take the horse back to camp (this is a desert trail), which means traversing through the woods.  Once the horse and rider are back in camp, there is a big party to celebrate the horse, and a lot more fun.  It was great to get back in the old west, at least in this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember the good old days when a good old-fashioned Hollywood story, well told with a good dose of mystery to it, would be followed by an even better story. It was an unselfish movie with a wonderful story to it. This movie isn't going to change the world and is probably only good for a Saturday afternoon when you want to relax after work and watch something good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are a few times in this movie where the movie comes across like a cheesy children's film with a few jokes here and there to keep it light.  As the movie ends and we start to realize what really happened to our hero, I was surprised at just how good this movie is.  There's a really good chemistry between everyone.  The action scenes are great, especially when all four heros are present at the same time.  This movie is a classic.  If you like fun adventure films, you should definitely check this out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was going through the same routine that people used to go through when they were a kid:  - play games with their friends,   which would often include them sitting around a camp fire and eating a sandwich and watching TV and doing nothing   - then go out to camp with their father,  and    They'd get out of bed and run around the campfire with their bare hands and do nothing  It was like being a kid all over again.   The only difference was they got paid $100 a day.  But it was great fun and there was no money.  I liked the fact that  the film was set in the same place as the real thing,  but I did find it a bit  dull   the "kids" in the picture were mostly just like normal teens.  (the one in the film is about 16, the one in real life is about 18).   It just seemed like someone had a very different idea about teenagers.  The real kids were like that because they were all over the place.  They did something in one scene, they did another scene, then they did the same thing again. In real life kids would sit and play cards and drink soda and do their homework.  In the film we were treated to all sorts of nonsense, like  they're in the army and some guy is going to march down the beach in shorts.  It didn't work, not as good as the film I remember from a younger age. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've never really seen a western before, but I did like this one. I was at a theater to watch the new Star Trek movie, and it seemed like a waste of money. I had heard good things about this film, and so I headed to the theatre. I sat alone in a dark theater, staring at the screen for over an hour. The only sound I hear is from the movie projector. The movie seemed pointless. It had a cowboy and a girl out on a road trip, and after a little time the girl starts to feel sick. It's over before it really begins, as the cowboy and the girl are thrown in a cell, and the guy takes a long, hard, hot shower. Then he takes off his shirt and starts to rub and blow some lady's feet. So there you have it, what is a western movie but a western played by a cowboy. I liked the western, but the Western didn't do anything for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not sure if there is a better movie than this one, not even close.    It's about three little kids trying to outrun a killer.  This movie is one of those "A" movies that is made by people who can make good movies that nobody wants to watch and who have to go out of their way to avoid bad ones.  My only complaint is that my kid brother and I both ended up watching this with our younger brothers who were 9 and 13.  It was really pretty.  I watched it with my brother and we both thought it was pretty good.  What I really liked about this movie was that the "killer" was a young boy.  The kid has so much to do that it is hard to keep track of all of it.  There was a great scene in the schoolhouse in which the girl and the kid sit at the same table and each eats an apple while discussing a scary movie.  Both are very smart kids but not sure where the hell to start.  Finally the kid pulls out a camera and starts snapping pictures with it, but in all of them the kid's face looks the same, which makes us think that there is something wrong with him.  While the kid has gotten much better since he has been little, his family has also gotten much worse.  His father is a sadist and he is often cruel to his family and his brother and sister.  Our boy is a really nice boy, but he is also really kind and loves his brother very much.  If you have kids you might want to think carefully about letting them watch this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great sequel, if you like the first one:  The story is the same as in the first movie (minus the aliens) - a crew is sent to investigate the disappearance of a ship. However, upon arriving to the island, they are attacked by a gigantic creature - the biggest reptile known to man. The movie is very interesting to watch: it combines a lot of different types of creatures together - from the cute and adorable lizards and reptiles to giant dinosaurs. The special effects make the movie really awesome: a lot is done in special effects - most notably by the CGI used in the monster scenes.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a little hard to decide which one of these three great old school Americana stories is the best. "I Shot an Arrow at Mary Ann" is a funny little comedy about a gang of kids who go around shooting arrows at things until they start killing people. "Old Man Logan" is an early-1960s reworking of the Arthur Rimbaud tale, with Logan as the old man, living in a cabin in the woods and learning to ride a pony and hunt moose. And "The Wild Bunch" is just really, really wild. One of the greatest movies ever made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is definitely one that I recommend to everyone that is in love with the genre of film.  The plot is very straightforward and the plot is executed by the good old fashioned director that has made so many great movies over the years.  It is set in an alternate universe in which the Nazis conquered and enslaved Britain and England were the most powerful countries on earth.  But not even Hitler was that great and the British did not need to try and stop him until one day the United States and Japan stepped in and stopped the Nazi invasion, this is when the story truly begins.  In a way this is a comedy and this is where the film does not disappoint.  While this is clearly a satire of the "super villain" genre of movies you have to keep in mind that this is also a comedy.  There is one scene near the end that really made me laugh when it was clear that the Americans had had enough and they sent the British out to fight them on their own.  This would have never made it out of the original script and it would have been too ridiculous to be made up.  A great addition to anyone's collection of movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a film you should see if you haven't seen it. It was well-made and it had a great message, but it is so much more than that.  The film begins in a bar in the middle of the road. A black guy named Mike, played by Ray Liotta, is sitting at a booth trying to convince a girl named Paula to join him for the night. He says his name is Mike and he's going to take Paula to the movie. Paula is a regular at this bar, a black chick named Tia, played in the film by Leslie Caron, who is looking to make some money by having a woman sit down next to her at a movie, so she can see her movie. Tia says she wants to see the movie about the guy who used to do sex with his friends in an abandoned apartment building that he now rents out to women. Tired of waiting for Paula to walk over, Tia takes Paula's hand and they walk off to the theater. Paula doesn't walk into the theater, her friend does. Paula thinks it's funny because he's a black guy. Paula and her friend, TIA, both go into the dark theater, but only Paula comes out of it. TIA takes a drink from his beer and says he is not sure Paula is going to see her film. Paula says she's going out to a party after the movie and the bartender, the bartender who happens to be a black man named J.H., says that this is a "special occasion", and that everyone is going out for a night on the town, but that no one who hasn't gone out to the party before is going. J. H. then begins to ask Paula to do things that he thinks are "fun" or "funny", but she ignores them. The bartender then makes her put on lipstick, which makes her laugh. Paula then says that she likes lipstick, and the two of them go outside to take her to the car. They start to go, but J.B. (the black guy who lives in Paula's house) stops them, and asks them to wait. Paula decides she likes the smell of the car, and gets in the car anyway. The car is black, and they drive off to where the movie is being shown. JB follows them to see what's happening, and he sees Paula in the rear-view mirror with Tia. Jb says that he is
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good little adventure movie. The plot was interesting and I could see how an author could use a short story as a basis for a movie. I'm not sure if I enjoyed the movie as much as the short story and the plot was good but I was disappointed with the characters.   A group of mercenaries are hired to kill a bad guy. They are captured and taken to a remote place. While they are there they are told to get a good meal and get out. Once they are free the bad guy (Buck) asks them where they are from. They tell him they come from Mars, or maybe just the moon. They're pretty sure he'll believe them. Buck is from the future so maybe that explains the food. When they get back to Earth they are given a task: they are to steal a time traveler's coat. It's a pretty easy job but then the time traveler shows up. The movie keeps adding new characters like the guy who was in the space suit. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best thing about this film is how well it works as a horror/thriller. If it is all about a little girl with a phobia, it could get pretty ugly at times and that's the kind of stuff that's really scary. The acting is also quite good here with plenty of subtlety. There's some pretty dark stuff, but it all works in conjunction with that phobia that keeps the characters in check. There are a few scares in this, but they don't last too long.   What really stands out in my mind about the entire film is when the little girl, who is still unnamed and barely seen at any point, tries to climb the stairs to her grandmother's apartment, but is thrown off by her phobia. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a little strange in this movie to see a guy who seems to be completely normal and kind of a loner. Then we find that his friend is a crazy killer with a fetish for mutilated babies and he becomes involved in the murder and the mystery of what the baby killer has planned.   The movie is told in the third person as if the first two parts of the movie (where the killer's girlfriend and the killer get to know each other a little) are just one long conversation between them.    A couple of scenes are a little bit weird, such as when the killer tells the girlfriend he knows her "good" for the things she can do with her feet that look like she's having a foot fetish. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is pretty much the most ridiculous science fiction movie to come out in the last 25 years. It's an early 2000s space comedy about two men who, after crashing a spaceship, are stranded on a planet that seems to be the "ultimate" desert where they become heroes by saving its desert inhabitants. So, the movie is basically about a pair of idiots who save people in a desert, and eventually get to the ultimate desert where, in the climax, they meet a giant snake that eats people and then kills them in their sleep. And then they get to a planet in a star system where they meet yet another bunch of people who are trying to run their space station into outer space (and then, in a huge, bizarre twist, have it crash into an alien star and then die). After that, they go to a second planet (which has the same alien as before), and a giant alien that likes to eat people eats the station in an amazing explosion. And that's basically the whole movie, except for some brief bits, which make up for a lot of the other stuff. It is a pretty awful movie from start to finish, but it did try a little too hard for a "weird" look. It certainly has a few goofy jokes here and there, but the movie never does anything interesting or worth seeing.

It is one of the oddest movies out there.  It is about a strange bus (that looks like an old school bus) where the passengers live on the road, and the drivers work for the city bus line.  They get picked up, then get dropped off...   It was a nice film to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good and very enjoyable movie! In a way it can be compared to Jules and Jim. Not just because there's a lot of shooting but also because it looks like a Western movie (at least from the start). The best part though are the characters and the way they interact. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first time I read "A New World: The Soviet Union" in school, I thought it was a very bad book: a bunch of rambling and uninteresting descriptions about life in the Soviet Union. In the second time I found it to be a very interesting story. This is a very good film based on a very rich and complex book. In it, we get the first hints of the terrible crimes of Stalin and of his son, who was raised as a child in the same place that he died: Moscow, during the 1930s. We also get a small glimpse of Stalin's last years in charge of the NKVD - the security service - which has now become the KGB. A lot of things about Stalin are told in an entertaining way, especially during a party where Stalin is in charge and where we also meet some of his top men. The film makes its hero the man whom the book tells us was one of the great geniuses of all time: a brilliant and ruthless dictator who created the Soviet Empire and who then killed off those who might challenge it. He was also a great showman, and a man who wanted to remain in power and who had no intention of going down with his ship. In addition, he was a real bastard, a man so greedy and so bad and so cruel that in his final years, he did not want to be treated like a hero, but to die like one: at the hands of his own people.  The main hero is a man called Oleg, who had the misfortune to be born in the wrong place at the wrong time and was then sent to Stalin's childhood home on Yakutia. The main villain of the film is the man who was in charge during the years that Stalin was in Yakut, and who is now living in Moscow with his family. The movie is very good and entertaining. It is set in the 1920s so that you feel as if you have been there already, though the events are slightly modified: for example, the NKV is no longer an NKVD but the KGB, and the Soviet soldiers who have taken over are called the Red Army instead of Red Army soldiers (you are not exactly sure whether you are watching a movie or reading a book). This makes the movie much easier to enjoy. One of the highlights of the movie is the interview with the Soviet people who were involved in the famine. Stalin made a big deal of the fact that the famine had been caused by the
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "I am not sure what to think of this one. I am pretty sure I was supposed to like it. I just feel it wasn't executed very well. I think they would have done better if the story had gone more in-depth on how they would do it in the city and how they were using the technology at that time. It seems like the entire city just became a prison by the end. It does seem like they would not have had much problem taking over the entire town. It has some good sci-fi elements in it, but in the end it just seems to me like the "space-faring" part of the plot was the only element that got put in there. I do not think this is a bad movie; I think it is a well-directed movie and I think the ending did a good job in setting up the movie. But I feel like this is not really the film to see for fans of the Star Trek universe."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a country which produces lots of action films and movies in general, it is quite rare to find a film that doesn't take itself seriously; a film made in a time of chaos, war, political intrigue and other such stories is not meant to be a comedy.   But there it is, a film full of action, humour, suspense, intrigue, emotion and heart.  There is much to admire and admire about this film, for it is a truly original film.  A great directorial debut, a great story, a beautiful screenplay, and all around the best film I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really good movie. It has many of the classic elements one associates with the great movies of the late 20th century like the famous musical number, the well written script and the gorgeous production values. But then there are also the strange elements that one rarely finds in a movie of this genre. In general the film is a good comedy and it is the star and director Michael Curtiz who has done everything to give it the right sense of humor. But even so the film has a certain edge. It is not a good time. When I was watching it I had a great time and I would not hesitate to recommend it to any one who has no interest in a big budget Hollywood film. It would be funny to see the film today as it is an entertaining comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just watched this, and I have to say I enjoyed it quite a bit. The film starts off with a very dramatic moment (like that) and ends up just as much dramatic. I do have to complain that the ending is rather cliche as it just ends with our protagonist saying goodbye to his friends and family members before they leave for college. While it could have been better it does have a fairly good theme for the story. This movie is worth a watch, even if it's just to see the wonderful performances of John Rhys-Davies as the young Tom and the very sadistic, but very well directed Peter Yates as the older Tom.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a well-directed crime film, with a good cast (one of whom, played by Anthony Edwards, did an amazing job), and a terrific script that, while not exactly exciting, is not completely forgettable either. I liked that, it is not too often that I can say that about a bad crime film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There aren't many films that have been made like this. I don't think that the film is as good as it thinks it is. It's very uneven. It isn't bad, it just is the most uneven film I've ever seen. The actors are all over the place. One actor has a very bad performance. Some of them, like the main character, are almost unnoticeable. The story itself is quite boring and the movie lacks the excitement that you would expect from an Indiana Jones film. For an Indiana Jone's fan, this is a great Indiana Jones movie. I have seen a few Indiana Jones films and this is probably the best one yet. If you love Indiana Jones then this is an enjoyable film and is well worth a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember I saw this movie once on a late night movie channel but I was too young to be able to get it at that time. It was a great movie, just one of those movie shows that are made so badly and so badly it doesn't matter. It doesn't have to be a good one, a little effort would be good enough. I don't really like the way it ends, it just shows all the people who aren't into it that if there was a way to get the film to a different place it would be so much better! I remember watching this with my dad and we both thought it was really good. I think it was the first movie where I really began to understand why there is a film industry. I love the way they used old movies, it's a great thing!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an excellent film. The plot is complex, but never tiresome. There is also a wonderful sense of humour in the characters, a subtle touch of irony in the story, and a terrific soundtrack.   "How much more time do I have?"   A simple, yet powerful sentence, from a good man.

This movie is not only a great movie but an epic movie from start to finish. John Carpenter has written a great piece of entertainment that is sure to entertain the entire family. I highly recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of the greats.   This movie is very good. The acting is great, the direction is well done, the action scenes are fantastic, all the little things that make it all so good, make it so good: the special effects, the great music, the incredible acting, the wonderful performances by all the characters, all of the things that made me happy while I watched this movie, you will probably still remember them a while after the credits roll, you're a movie addict:).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was a kid, I lived on the border of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. There, there were two pretty small towns: West Milford, Pennsylvania and West Milken, New Jersey. I don't remember where on Earth West Milbury was, but I remember being really scared when I was 4 or 5, and that was after a couple of weeks at the home of my grandparents. My grandma and auntie had moved to West Milington from Boston when I could remember. My first memory is seeing a ghostly figure, and the next thing I knew, I was crying because my mother's doll was gone, and I had to find it in the back of the closet.   Now, we all have that experience - the house always smells weird, the attic is always dark, there's nothing in the basement but a few things that belong there, and you know that if you step on any carpet in the house - like the one that goes around the living room - you will fall down the stairs and go into the dark attic.  I was not too young to understand that there was something else going on. I never knew that my grandparents could be so old, with all those funny wrinkles. Even after the house burned down, when I went to see my grandma and her family and friends, no one wanted to talk to me, they just stood there and looked at me and seemed to be holding their breath.  This was about a year or two before the first UFO sightings, but that summer, things were happening all over the place.  It was a dark, chilly night. I got to walk home from school. The only way to get out of the dark neighborhood was on the other side of the big old barn - to the street. I had been on the path that led to West Millinford when the barn burned.  I walked, with a stick and a flashlight, down the side of a hill, and up another to get the path back to my house - which I still remember as it was.  The first thing I saw in the dark was a shadow. I didn't know what it was - nothing was moving. Then I saw something more, and it moved, and then it wasn't there any more.  Then there was another shadow that moved. Then something more that moved - until it was gone.  All of a sudden I felt a pressure on my chest, and when I looked up I was staring at my
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An impressive and fun piece of science fiction. It will give a good laugh, but it is very well done. I thought about writing a positive book review, and then the movie came on TV.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's not much to write about a movie of little merit, but it's good for those who are fans of the old Hollywood horror, especially the old silent films of the 1920s.   This story is about a young woman who comes to town.  We see how this girl and her younger sister are the product of a father who doesn't live near them, who seems to be the type of man to stay out of society and who never really got over his infidelity years ago.  He married again, but she doesn't like him.  Her sister is an art student who is in the midst of her studies.  She is looking to meet an artist friend of hers who is an old friend of her mother.  The little sister is looking for the brother to take to the prom.  Well, they don't go to the big dance.  Instead, they get into a car and head to the county fair.  They seem to really like the fair and so it's not long before a strange man shows up at the fair.   The man, a woman and a small boy walk in with the family and go to a farmhouse where the old gentleman from the other night lives.  It seems like he is a good man, but the mother shows the girl to her bed while the man is away, so it seems as though he is not a good guy.   But he doesn't seem to know that.  When the girl is getting ready, the man arrives and she sees the tiny boy.  And then she sees all of him.   He is very well behaved.  There is a little girl in the room.  That makes this little guy the perfect guy, and we will get to know him.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's just a beautiful, wonderful movie that will stay with you a while. My son and I just sat down and watched the entire movie from start to finish and then he gave me one of the best presents I could ever ask for- a copy of the DVD. I've always wanted to see that movie and now it's in the hands of the people who gave us the best movie in film history. This movie is pure magic, the entire film has so much emotion in it and it never lets up. I hope that they do a better job with the rest of the episodes, but this is one of my favorite, most underrated movies ever.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent example of the kind of character work I expect from the excellent John Ritter (the best actor of the year), with the kindest of manners and the kindliest of hearts. He is a very fine, sympathetic figure in a very bad movie. It is also very funny, in a sort of self-aware way, and has a wonderful sense of humor about it, which is a welcome contrast to so much of the bad behavior. In short, this is a fine film, and it is very much worth watching, even if you find it too serious. If you only look at the positive aspects of this film, then you won't get a good sense of the whole movie, because of the way it is structured. It does have some nice touches, such as the way the movie starts with a scene of a train, then a scene with an old man in a bar singing a song to the tune of "You are So Beautiful," followed by a flashback of another old man, who is looking at his reflection in a mirror. And, as with many of Ritter's movies, it ends in a wonderful, whimsical, lighthearted climax, which also involves another very serious and dramatic scene. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of those films that I'm not going to bother mentioning again or again because I know it will probably be the same film on every screen. And no, I don't mean a remake! This is a really good movie but if you have seen it a dozen times on every TV station in the country you are going to miss it one time when it comes to the stage. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember reading in a book somewhere how a friend of a friend (I think it was from England) said he would love to watch a movie about a girl who became a girl. I never really liked a lot of things my friend did but this movie was just great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be clear, I love this movie. It is so much better than your average superhero movie, and I am a huge fan of the comic books that have been adapted. The action is epic and so well directed it was very challenging to watch. The story is very interesting and has an interesting cast of characters and one of my favorite actors in Peter Dinklage as the main villain in a classic action role.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After years of being told it was impossible to remake the classic classic 'Hollywood', it's now done by director George Romero himself. I've watched this film many times, and every time I like it, and it remains to be the best zombie movie ever made. There's a few issues in this film: the zombies are played by actors, which I find a bit odd. It also doesn't give them much time to develop, which is unfortunate. I also found it a bit of a let down, with the main character dying in the middle of the movie. Then there's a plot issue at the end of the film which is too convenient, but is not nearly as annoying as in the rest of the films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you ask me what I love about the Star Wars prequels, this is probably one of them. For one thing, the effects are pretty good. The battle of Endor looks like a scene out of Return of the Jedi. The effects are really nice. The sound effects are terrific as are the visual effects. One thing I found to be a little odd is that there are no aliens to speak to. Not sure why they wouldn't be in this movie but I guess in the future the galaxy would be too big to explore. I do hope they eventually get around to making a Star Trek prequel. I know I would watch that.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. I think it's a wonderful example of the sort of movie I like; well-acted and written.   This is a wonderful, witty, and romantic movie, and a must see for lovers of good acting, humor, and romance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was one of those movies I thought was just as entertaining as the average one I'm used to seeing. The plot was pretty standard. A college sophomore, living in a dorm, has a crush on the guy who lives across the hall. He takes a job on the roof of a building he and his girlfriend are renting. The next night, the guy comes to the girl's apartment to get a drink. The girl has a new boyfriend, a young man who she likes. She's not the girl he's after, but he's pretty easy to get into. The guy's friend comes over later and the two of them talk a little. They begin to kiss and they end up having sex in her dorm room. The guys are surprised that the girl didn't say no.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There's something really satisfying about watching an action movie where the entire cast is good looking, especially with the way the movie's shot pans from girl to girl. That sort of shot style was pretty common at the time, and it seems to be getting more and more common now. The film also shows a surprising range of female character types, with a lot of them being pretty sexy. The acting is strong here, mostly by Tom Hiddleston as the baddie, and a lot more good acting comes out of the supporting characters, as well.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen a lot of films in the last year or so. All great and a few not so great too, but I haven't seen any that have given me quite so much joy. This one, was all of the above!   "I'd rather be a pirate than a sheep!"   What a perfect way to sum up a pirate movie. As the name suggests, the pirates on the high seas are pirates. The bad guys are sheep. "I love to hunt for good food!"  "Oh no, they're going to eat my sheep!" "I hate sheep. What good are they anyway?"   It's a good pirate movie, with a great score by Howard Shore ( The Texas Chain Saw Massacre).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always said that the greatest thing to ever happen to Hollywood was "The Magnificent Seven,"   which is about four Mexican brothers who were taken in by an old couple living on a Texas ranch, and became a lawless hit squad that stole, robbed and killed people in various parts of the US and Canada. This was a great movie in every way.   It's very hard to watch, so I suggest that people who can't handle it watch it with a good friend, and then when they leave, have him watch it.  The first half hour is probably the best half hour Hollywood has ever produced, with this film being about three hours long. I've never seen anything like it before and I'm never going to see anything like that again in my life.  A truly magnificent movie, and one that you should have in your collection at all times.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never seen an action film that was as violent as this, nor an action movie that was so well acted as this (it has a lot to do with the way it shot, by the way... a low budget production like this one should never be given credit for good acting). It was an awesome movie that I had a very difficult time stopping on occasion from watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had high expectations going into this movie but was pleasantly surprised. It's not a good adaptation of the story. It starts out slow, with the movie being just as slow. The story, if taken at face value, is about a young boy named Ben who lives with his mom and a few older brothers. He is a typical "normal" kid. At the age of 13 Ben is sent to boarding school. There is a bunch of strange kids who live there that he sees a few times a week. They are usually not a problem. I found them kind of creepy, but I got over it, it just didn't seem to me like enough to make me really think anything about. At least it wasn't as bad as the movie about a little kid and his dog. I guess it isn't any different. I like this movie. It isn't a great movie. But the story is very good. The acting is good, the direction is fine, and the writing is fine. I liked it a lot. I'll re-watch it to see if I can find more characters to really like in it. Overall a good film. There isn't much else to say. It is just a simple story, a little slow, but a good story. And Ben is a great guy and a good little kid, who I think should live a lot longer.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an animated film of the highest order! Not only is it funny and fun, but it's also filled with a healthy dose of humor. The plot is a little convoluted, but so are the movies, so the audience will just have to be patient. And, yes, as is the norm for the characters, they are just plain, decent people and it's wonderful to see their happy faces on the screen.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is excellent. There is no plot and this movie was made for the sake of making money. But, this movie does a great job at it. It was not too long ago when a movie was so popular, that it is now considered a cult classic. This movie, called, "Funny Money" was made in 1967, in Los Angeles. The movie is about a woman named, Linda. She is rich, she wants to be rich, and she uses her money to get even. But Linda's brother was killed in Vietnam and now Linda has no job, so she decides to go to the circus to get work and make some money. After she got to the Circus she gets to see some of the best and most fun loving clowns ever made and the movie makes you laugh at times, and the music in this movie is great. The film was made by a man named, Robert Redford and it was filmed in Hollywood.

This is a very well acted, very smart film and really well put together. It has some very memorable scenes and the story it tells is well written and very interesting, a good little thriller.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It may not be my favorite movie of the last several years, but it's one of my favorite movies of recent years, and there's something in there for everybody. There are a lot of people who were really down on The Sixth Sense after seeing it in theaters, but I saw it in 4D and loved it. It was one of those things, like the film itself, that made me feel a little bit uncomfortable the first time I saw the film because the story seemed so unbelievable and yet, somehow, I can see how it could be so and so. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An impressive and suspenseful movie.   The plot is rather simple, but there are plenty of great characters, including a tough-as-nails police officer, a young woman with a strong will and a young detective who has a big heart for justice.  They all need to survive the night and if one of them is out of the game - they all are.

It is about a boy (Bubba Ho-Tep) who loses his father after a horrible accident. As a boy he is raised by his mother (Natalie Wood) in a very primitive community.  After a long time Bubba has enough and escapes. Bubba sets off with a boy named Jim, who he rescues from being killed and sold as a slave.  They run into many difficulties on their way from Georgia to Florida.  BUDBA HOPPING is about love and adventure.  I loved it.  Posted by   @ 7:17 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the movie about a couple who live in an apartment with their cat. There is some drama here. The cat is a bit like a human. I don't even want to describe her. The guy is a loser who is not worth her attention. Her mom is not very nice either. All you can really hear is the cat's purring, and the sounds of the kitchen. I am glad this movie didn't go in a different direction, because it is very boring. This movie has nothing special about it, just a couple, in a nice apartment, with a cat. This is definitely not my favorite movie, but it is enjoyable. I would like to see more stuff like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a city where no one can make it rain, or the sun comes out, this "comedy" is a great way to spend an afternoon at the beach. It is very good that the cast is so great. Everyone is great:  The "comic" is great. It has a good mix of comedy and drama. There are some hilarious moments, like when the girl gets her foot caught between two rocks, and it's difficult to get it loose. Other funny moments are when the people at a local restaurant try to give a party.  The best scene is a couple that go to an open beach to find someone who can help them get rid of a shark.  You will want to see it again, and again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a reason this is a classic (at least to me), and that is that it's an unapologetic work of art that is both thought provoking and thought provoking.   In the movie, the main character, played by Clint Eastwood (of "Ace Ventura," "Top Gun" fame), is an ex-military officer who has come out of retirement and is looking to get his life back together. He meets with one of his old commanding officers, played with the same intensity and charisma as Clint Eastman, who is working with a gang of criminals trying to bring down a famous real estate developer (played by Tom Selleck) who had gotten greedy and greedy.  The story was well known, but it is great to see Clint Eastwoods back in a movie (after so many years of watching his movies) and to see the real-life character of Colonel John "Toby" Smith who he worked with in the military come to life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Not a bad movie at all, though it does lack a few points.  Some characters are drawn somewhat poorly; for example, Peter Parker's mother is much taller and has a more defined face, though there's nothing wrong with the film (at least, that I'm aware of).  It doesn't stand out from the pack in terms of animation, either, although it's not bad.  It's definitely one of the better Spider-Man comic book movies (though it may not be the best Spider-man movie) and one of those rare cases in which the web-slinging, super hero, is given something more than comic relief.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was another nice movie. It was good to see a great actor like Richard Kiel (as the head of the IRS) and a nice supporting cast like Mary Steenburgen (as a very wise old lady) and Susan Sarandon (who gives a performance that's pretty much in every movie she does).  I think it's nice to see some of these old movie stars in modern day movies - like it's very refreshing.  The ending of the movie might be a bit of a letdown, although it did end on a high note. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film features some really fine acting and is very well-made.   I think the best scene in the movie is the one where a drunk is riding his bicycle home after a drink of water in a local park.  A young couple (not related by blood) are sitting next to the street, the drunk is talking about the beauty of the evening air when a policeman on a bicycle pulls up beside him and asks him to move on because there are no cars in the street.  He moves on but is chased down by the policemen.  After a few minutes of this he is able to get away and starts to walk home.  The couple walks with him and he gives them a tour of his city as he walks and talks.  They see a couple in a dark and scary basement and a man in a black hoodie holding the door closed.  It's at this point that we realise that we are watching a film in a low budget, amateurish horror movie.  At least at the outset, it does a fine job of setting up the creepy atmosphere, and the actors do a fine impression of the characters.  With all the action and gore, this is a somewhat uninspiring and simple thriller.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen this one yet and I hope that I never do. It's so bad. I've been told that there is something really good going on with the second and third parts, but I'm just not getting it. If there is one scene which really made me feel that these people really believe that their movie is worth watching it is just at the end of Part One where the camera pulls back to take a look at the city, looking for any sign of life on the streets. There is none, nothing even, to indicate that life is even possible on the street. I mean, you'd think that a city with such a high rate of murder would be more than capable of generating life somehow. I'll get a chance to look into the next two films, which I plan to see in a theater in my hometown. It seems that this kind of film is a favorite of the "cinema goer," but I think there is much more than a little bit of truth to the old saying that there are no real friends or real enemies. And if there are, it would seem that it doesn't happen on the big screen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had been reading about the film for a while, but never saw it. So when it came out, I knew I had to get it, even though I knew it was not nearly as good as the reviews made it out to be. I have only seen this a couple of times, so I have no idea how good it is, but I still thought it was a very good film!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is very hard to find a new film about the Second World War that is not a war movie and this is one of those times. The story of the movie revolves around the American military commander General Douglas MacArthur and a squad of soldiers who are trying to stop the Nazi invasion of Greece, but they never make it out.   A film that has many historical references, a lot of action and suspense, a nice soundtrack and some very beautiful scenery. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen the theatrical trailer for A Clockwork Orange (1971) twice.  It is an extremely disturbing movie, not to mention a truly awful movie.    It has that feeling, the feeling that you are actually seeing the things you see depicted.  The movie is very violent.  Most people probably know it as a Kubrick movie, which I think it is; but I also remember watching it in the theatre when I was in 8th grade.  I remember thinking to myself, 'I should see this movie; it would be awesome.'  So I did, and I didn't like it.  It was very scary and very weird.  However, a decade later I saw it again, in college in a tiny theatre with a few other guys.  Even though they were watching a lot of cheesy teen movies ( The Bodyguard, Pretty in Pink, The Goonies ) they still got the vibe.  In college we would often just stand there and watch scary movies until it was time to leave.  A ClockworkOrange was the only one we really didn't want to leave until the end; it was like watching an episode of The Twilight Zone.   It was actually pretty good that night, and when the movie ended I was really excited to see what they would do next.  There were a few different twists in the plot, and some really great characters that would come back (more than a few of them).  This movie is really a must see for horror fans, but it also goes over in my mind how good Stanley Kubrick was as a director and the kind of movies that he made, the way the editing looked and the way he was able to make these different genres into one, like the surreal, the horror, the sci-fi, the political, etc...  I really liked this movie, and even though it was kind of a letdown in many ways I still watched it again and again.  And I was lucky enough to see it a second time with a couple of friends a few years ago in my own theatre.  Now, on to what I think about this movie: First of all,   A clockwork orange is a bad movie. I can't think of a better way to describe it. The writing is horrible, the acting is bad, the visuals are bad and there isn't even a good acting.  This would never have been allowed to be released in the US.  So this is a very

This movie is nothing more than a buncha lame, fat, and stupid guys having a bad time getting out of jail- which, again, is nothing to laugh about.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Muppet Caper (1966) was the last great film made by the legendary Jim Henson (1926-1982). It was a great fun to watch and a little sad when they decided to retire him in favor of a less dramatic and more commercial approach to the Muppets.  The Muppet shows were all-time great shows, and they had a great deal of humor to make them as good as they were.  There are very few "good" movies that feature Muppetry but the Muppet movies made by Henson are the greatest in the history of the MUPPETS!  The greatest, the Moooonest, the best, the last Great Moochie Caper.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a good film that has a little too much going on to keep you from enjoying it. But that doesn't stop it from being great fun. The cast is fantastic, the action is great, and it's got a fun ending.  It is, in my opinion, one of the best comic book films ever made. It combines elements from many different genres and it is truly one of those rare films that make you smile, laugh, and feel the urge to get up and go home. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie as a young girl and was not the least bit impressed by it.   Well, at least I didn't like it. I liked to sing along with some songs from The Lion King (the Lion King!) and as the movie goes on, the "lion king" (the "King" is only the lion's voice) becomes so fat that he is unable to sing and starts to drool all over the place! But all of a sudden he starts singing again and he makes a terrible mess of everything.  He goes from being very fat to very slim, so bad that he has to wear a very long shirt and then he goes back to being fat again. At the very end the "king" goes back into a hole and starts singing "My song," a song I don't remember hearing.  There are many "good" songs in this movie (which is not a bad thing), but they were not very good and they were very out of place.  One thing that didn't do it for me was the fact that the movie was based on a short story by the novelist Stephen King. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the film that got me into independent films.   I don't know what the deal is with the directors and actors.  I'm a little puzzled by the lack of continuity here. It has all the hallmarks of being a crappy movie.  There's a strange kind of melodrama and it's not clear where the story comes from.  This movie's only redeeming quality is that it has the most gorgeous and haunting music in the history of movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I found this movie to be very entertaining and even if the plot is not too complex at first. It soon becomes, however, and one that is not so easy to get into. The movie is divided into two parts. The first half is about the day of the attack, which is a little different from the usual sort of terrorist story. There are no planes, no helicopter and no helicopters in the first part. There were, however a lot of men on motorcycles. The second part was more of a typical hostage video where the terrorists had a woman with a child, one of the terrorists is killed during the attack and the remaining man goes crazy, is then killed by his own men. As a result, the woman is forced to go back to her home and raise the child herself. It was a very emotional film and I could relate to it quite well because of this. I could imagine myself in the woman's situation because the same sort of thing happens in my own life: A man gets mad at something he's done, and he can't accept it and his actions result in him murdering the one person who made him feel better about himself. It all seems so very like the same thing to me. I also like the ending with the woman standing in a doorway, crying, as she watches the man go by. It does remind me of the ending of this movie: A woman (not so much a woman, as a young child) is left behind at a party, but is rescued by a young man who runs away. When he is caught, he is asked to tell the young woman his story and he does. This is a good ending to this movie, but I think it would have been better if the woman had not been seen crying. It is, as I said, a pretty good movie with an interesting plot that does have a lot to offer, however I am not sure this is a movie for everyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After watching this movie several times I finally got it in my head that it is just a spoof.  I really don't believe that anybody really does this sort of comedy.   The fact that they use actors and actresses that don't know anything about comedy doesn't help either.  It looks like the director just sat down with some actors and asked them to act, which is something he does every now and then.  This movie is all the more offensive when you take a look at the names of the actors: Michael Keaton, Billy Bob Thornton, and Richard Roxburgh.  So much for getting a sense of humor from them.  If you have ever been around the Beverly Hills comedy circuit, I'm sure you will be able to tell the guys from here have been doing this kind of thing for a while.  There is a brief intermission and then the director goes back to where we first saw the film.  Again a bunch of actors and women in some ridiculous comedy make up.  What else is new, right?   This movie is a very bad parody of some very real events that happened.  They also are playing into the same stereotypes that Hollywood already has going on.  In the scene where the camera man looks through the window (which was a nice touch) the woman walks by in her underwear as the camera zooms in, and she looks at the camera as well.  When the women finally get home, they tell their husbands about the night and they all seem to find it funny.  The way they dress, act, and talk just reminds me of some of the actresses that have appeared in movies over the years (not including Mel Brooks' movies).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was hoping to see this movie, it had been a long time coming. I like horror but didn't really like many horror movies as a kid. This one was a good one. The whole movie is about the "unthinkable" in some ways, and that is certainly not a bad thing, in the beginning of the movie, the guy who's playing the part of the father is really good in the role. After that the scary stuff starts to come into play. The effects were well done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those "I wish I would have known about this" kinds of movies that everyone should watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is definitely a classic movie that many have seen. I have never watched this movie but I have read about it. It was one of those movies that is just one of the best from all of time. The acting was good and I have to give kudos to the actors who did it. This movie is just fun and it is a timeless movie that we should watch and love. It has everything the family movie could ever want and more. I give this movie an A.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can't decide between The Thing (1982) and The Thing From Another World (1982). Both films are wonderful in their own way, and The Best Thing In The World (1985) is just as good with its use of the "old" film noir style. A perfect film for summer fun, I hope these two films get made again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed the first movie about the war.  A good amount of the scenes are not filmed in Germany or at all.   There are some American troops and soldiers on the run in France and at the end they do a great job.  The story is told by the soldiers who do what they must.  This is no action movie.  There is a real struggle between the Germans and the French to win the war and the action has more to do with the soldiers than the guns. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about an oddball guy who finds himself living among the normal people he's only met twice in his life. He ends up helping them out in one way or another and he ends up becoming their best friend. This kind of movie is all the rage right now (with good reason) and The Happening  is a good example of how a great story can be told with an odd cast of characters. It may not be as good as The Ring  and it's certainly not as good a story as The Matrix  but it's still a good watch. You might even enjoy it more than some of the movies in the Matrix franchise (which I never do).
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best science fiction movie you'll see in a while. I've seen a number of "alien invasion movies" over the years, and I always found the genre to be cheesy, yet entertaining. I saw this one as soon as it came out, and didn't think I'd like it. The "story" was that some alien ships landed near a small town in the western United States, and a local farm boy saw something strange when they arrived. A group of local teenage girls were also watching something strange. Then the aliens attacked the town. They used their weapons like ray guns that were apparently made of gold, and the people panicked. The girls ran out to their cars, and we see them drive away. Then a truck drives up and pulls up next to the truck. It's some kind of monster truck. The monster truck drives off with the girls. Then we see the truck come back, it's a truck that looks like a giant flying saucer. It stops in the middle of a street and the driver says, "Hi, I'm Bill Hickey from the Future". He then gets out of the saucer and is about to say something to the girl with the gun, but she fires at the monster truck and it flies off. The truck takes off with another group of teenagers chasing it. So far the movie doesn't take any real risks, but it has some nice looking creatures. I don't remember much of the plot, but I guess it seems that the aliens, who aren't really aliens at all, are the ones that are coming to take these people to the future. I like the movie, but not in the way I like sci-fi movies. It has a cool atmosphere and is fun, but nothing to write home about.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was initially quite disappointed with this movie. I wasn't even sure if they were even attempting to make a movie in the first place. I'd heard about a sequel to "The Crow" by Robert Rodriguez a few years ago, and I was interested. Unfortunately I discovered the movie wasn't based on the source material. The only similarity was that the main character, an assassin and bodyguard named The Crow, had a child with the witch. He didn't make much of a story in this sequel, I guess they didn't need to. I thought I'd seen everything bad that could be in a movie about a guy with crow feet. I guess I was wrong. I'm still somewhat shocked that a movie this bad isn't more popular. I just hope someone makes a movie that's even badder.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good old fashioned cowboy movie about a horse-rider who decides to go camping in a remote wilderness and come upon a woman who has been killed by a black bear while she was sleeping. He decides to keep her body and keep going, and when he reaches the campfire he notices that the fire is burning low. He takes the woman's body out and puts it into the fire. When the flames begin to rise he goes to save it, but is confronted by a wild dog who bites him on the head, knocking the man into unconsciousness. When he comes to he finds a bear, who he manages to chase away from the campsite. However, the bear has left the dead body behind, and the horse continues toward the fire, but the bear comes and grabs the horse. It then turns the horse around and rides away. While at the camp site the horse's rider sees a red glow in the distance and follows it. When they arrive they find a red-and-white-striped mountain of fire with a large white man riding the horse-mounted fire. He says, "Ain't I a big ol' shot? We should go around, check out the others, and see if that fellow wants a good time or a fight."   There are very few, if any, romantic elements to the film. I'm not sure why, since this is based on a novel by a famous cowboy writer, John Wayne, but they did not make the film in which this story occurs. The film was probably made to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of this film. The main characters seem to be the same old characters of the Western genre: the hotshot, the wild-haired cowboy, the laconic, white-robed, one-eyed, white guy. However the story is quite different from most of those films. I was reminded of John Ford's classic The Searchers, which, unlike the film that preceded it, actually included a few romantic elements.   I am not sure how to rate the film, since I liked it quite a bit. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one has good moments and bad ones. It's a fun watch. It is quite fun. My only problem is there's not much to the plot. It seems to be more about the actors and how they can be used and there's nothing really new here but it's still fun.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have had this movie in a few different formats.   It had been a long time since I had seen it on the big screen.  It is always nice to be reminded that I am a living history.  This is a movie that is about a battle in Europe from a time when the Nazis and the communists were at war.  For those who haven't seen it before, the fighting is intense, but not that long.  They play the war in a realistic and interesting way. The Americans do an amazing job of taking command of the Allied forces and holding their own in spite of the odds they were faced with.  We meet a good amount of people that have a part in history. In this battle we hear of the capture of the city of Kursk.  During the siege there are a lot of casualties.  The movie also provides a good account of Hitler's last days.  I watched this movie with my wife and two little daughters.  All of us enjoyed the movie and had a good time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I watched it, I was absolutely terrified. The plot is pure insanity, with everything from a "man-eating" monster to a "naked woman" being brought forth at the same time.   But what really scared me were the actors. They were just completely awful.   So in some ways it was more disturbing that what I had imagined was going to happen:  two guys, one with a gun, are walking across the ocean, towards a village which is all tied up.  While they are walking through the village, they come across a naked woman who is tied to a tree.  And there is this monster lurking around in the forest, so naturally these guys have to fight the monster to save the village.    The movie had so many weird things going on I was having a hard time following them all, until I came across the scene where a man with a giant penis comes out from a cave, takes a giant knife to a man and his dog and slits their throats.  It was actually more disturbing in my mind than anything else going on, but I still have to give credit where credit is due:  It does have some good scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are a few issues I have with this movie, but nothing too major, other than an obvious bias towards the more realistic portrayal of the Soviet Union as a country under siege. This movie's best qualities include its soundtrack, the cast, and the acting by both Valeri and Maksim. This film, in fact, is a far better film than "Vladimir Ilyich Makhno: His Life and His War" (1991), the documentary that it based upon. If you're a Makhnovist you'll enjoy "Garden of Death", as long as you're not a Nazi.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just got into this movie because it's a nice addition to the "L" section of the DVD catalogue.   This movie features a great movie actress in the role of the daughter of a movie star, played by the great Mary Hart.   She looks like a perfect model of beauty and, like the film she is in, is the center of attention.   She plays the wife of a Hollywood movie star.  The two are seen working side-by-side on set as they shoot the picture.  This is all well and good until the moment a storm occurs and, in spite of the weather and the heavy rain, the couple sets up their film camera, set it down on a dock and head for a safer part of the shore.  I'm not even sure what the storm is, but it's enough to make it impossible to shoot the pictures and it is during the storm that the picture starts to turn into a disaster.  When all is lost, they return the film camera to the dock and, after a short walk, the girl in the picture comes along looking a little disheveled and is more than a little worried when they meet her.  But then the picture turns out to be a good film, at least the part that is shot at the beach.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an excellent science fiction movie, with an excellent cast including an actor who would later play the role of Lt.

However, he is too late, because she has already taken off and is on her way to Earth! This is a beautiful story, beautifully filmed, written by a great writer and directed by another great writer.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought there was going to be a lot of blood.   Well, here's a movie about a blood-soaked family - a dad, two sons and two daughters.  I never thought I would hear the words "blood-soaking".   It was a nice little movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie is like a bad memory: that which is most often forgotten, will later come back to haunt you. This is an old movie from a long-running series, set in the early 1950's. At one time there were quite a few of these little movies, so that you could see several stories on the same stage in a row. The first one was probably the best and probably the most romantic one. Not to be outdone, the second movie featured a much more interesting plot, although it seemed to be a long one. As for the last one, I can't remember much about it, but what I do recall, is that it was a little too sentimental for my taste, although I suppose I can live with that. I like the old stuff, but I really don't enjoy the old-fashioned romance stories, and I don't think any of these movies will ever be good enough to compete with the classics.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story that follows it was fun. I never thought of going to the beach in a movie and never thought I'd actually get the chance to go. But I did and I must say it was a nice walk in the park with a nice breeze as I walked. I think the movie was great because it gave me the idea of what an ice rink looked like and how fast it was moving. The music and the scenery were also really good as well and a lot of people came over from the area to sit and take the chance of watching the rink. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the more underrated and enjoyable action movies of the 1990s.  With a great cast (including Gary Busey), a great soundtrack, a killer plot, and a memorable villain... what more could you ask for?  I can still remember the scene in which Tony Curtis is running from the law, chased by an angry mob, when he comes across a group of kids hanging out in the bushes, playing catch.    "How do you like us now, old man?" one kid asks.  After a bit of laughing and teasing, the other kids take off running as well, and it's all downhill from there.  The plot is a bit clunky at first, but it works once you get used to the fact that nobody is safe.  There's plenty of shooting, explosions, and car chases.  What makes it so good is that it's very fun to watch.  All of these things have a good balance.  Tony Curtis makes for an excellent protagonist, and his relationship with his partner, Bill Pullman, is fun.  Even the supporting cast, including Robert Loggia as the bad guy, is great.  It's not perfect, but I can say it's definitely one of those movies I want to watch over and over again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie about a war between humans and monsters in the jungle that I don't want to watch because it doesn't make me feel like I belong there.   It's not just that the movie isn't good.  There's so much wrong with it.  The main story line involves an old man who has become an eel and now can live as an eer again.  It has all the hallmarks of a cheap B-movie:  1) there are no monsters/angry monsters.  2) you never see any other monsters.   3) the old man has the same voice and the same expression on his face.  4) the warring humans and the eel monsters fight.   5) the movie takes place at sea and at night.  6) the camera does not move.  7) there is no music in the movie.  8) the two eels (which are more like piranhas) eat people and eat a dead man.  9) the scene of the young boy being eaten by an eeling is a bad joke.  10) there's no explanation as to how people get their tails and why they can survive in the middle of the jungle.  I've read that this movie was made for a local children's television show in the 1940's.  Perhaps one of the problems with this movie is that it is not really that good in parts.  Part of me likes how it is a bit silly and a little wacky.  But I know why this movie only got a single star,   I'm not sure what the appeal is.  What I do understand,  is that if I were a boy who got into the film on the strength of its silly plot lines,  this would probably be something I liked watching with my friends. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie and my brother has enjoyed it too! It is a pretty cool movie! It takes a nice long time to get to the story of the aliens and it's a little bit slow. This makes it more suspenseful because you never know when the aliens are going to get back. I also loved how the aliens were able to transform into a baby or into a dog. The way the alien is able to disguise the baby is great too! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film which I didn't see coming but I really enjoyed. I loved the way that the music was used to great effect, both in terms of mood and in relation to the action. I thought that the actors were all excellent and that they played their roles with the utmost intelligence.   I'm sure that people have to be in the same situations as they are in this one to like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you love horror movies, then this one is for you. Director Don Coscarelli has put together a solid yet enjoyable film, with plenty of scares and gore to go around.   It has a pretty simple premise: The little girl that is killed by an unknown murderer. The murderer is caught by her aunt's son, and he is forced to watch as the murderer murders a young girl and tortures him for hours. This leads to a bit of a twist, since there seems to be a bit more to the killer than what is shown in the film. I found the film very fun, and I'm sure you will too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My first experience with a good horror movie was the original "Freddy Got Fingered" (1976).  It took me years to realize how good the remake is.  The first time I saw it, I laughed out loud and I laughed again, and I still laugh.    If you like scary movies, this is a must-see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me, this is the definitive version of The Goonies. The soundtrack is great, but the film doesn't. The Goony Goon Show is about a boy who gets caught up in a world where he doesn't belong, and the Goonies are just a bunch of goofballs. But the story has a lot of heart, and they don't give up until they are back where they belong. You don't need to watch the movie and the soundtrack to understand why this movie is a classic.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of my all-time favorite movies. It's a good example of how good a piece of genre storytelling can be. It has all of the action, suspense, and action-movie-film-smashy elements that most filmmakers could only dream of. I loved every second of the movie and this was my favorite version of it. I would highly recommend it to any lovers of good drama, good horror, and great action movie-film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie about people trapped in a car for 4 days. They're stuck in a tiny space so small they have no choice but to survive, but the story is told in an interesting and very well-paced manner. It's a good example of how well-written a script can be, how good writing makes a good story, and how well told a story can be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   .   This is a very good movie with a lot of laughs.   The writing and voice acting is great.  I was thinking this was going to be the bad movie and it wasn't.  Well it wasn' t good either but that was what I came to see anyway so... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had heard that John Carpenter directed this film. I remember the first time I saw this film was when I was eleven years old. The film is a strange kind of horror. It is really quite creepy. The way the main character talks about his mother is rather strange. It seems as if he is constantly asking her to send for him in the middle of the night, which I think is something like a sick prank. The main character is always getting into trouble, either for his actions or his stupidity. The best part is when the main villain, the demon king, wants to destroy the main hero. That part is truly horrifying. The music in this movie is also a good fit to the horror. The sounds are very eerie and very scary. The movie is really not very good, as it doesn't really make much of a point. But it is not a bad movie. I would recommend it, but it is a bit overrated. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In any case, I am still amazed at how good a movie this is!   This is one of the few movies in which I can enjoy both the music and the acting (with the possible exception of the part where the actress is having a nervous breakdown on stage - she seems to be quite good at acting but just can't seem to stay calm and collected).   The only negative that I have to say about the movie is that the director, Paul Verhoeven, was too interested in the sexual aspect of the story which is not really his thing, but which is the main reason I think it's been nominated for a lot of awards, including a lot at the Berlin Film Festival.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie does some amazing things.  The director and star do well with their roles (they are both fantastic and really take a lot of the scene and do it well).  But it's really that the characters and the story work so well that it is impossible to find anything bad about this movie.  This movie is an early entry in the series, but it should hold it's own:    It's probably not the most well-known character of the series (but then, she's hardly the most known character on this planet), but she's definitely the most popular character (and the second most popular movie character behind the Great Wall of China!)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is pretty much just a different look at the same kind of old movie.    The same guy, and the same woman...that's about all it's changed.  A lot of the women are in lingerie...like that guy...or the lady in the picture...or maybe this one.  I can see why they call it the "Great White"...  The Great White...I see.  It's a lot of fun.  This movie has a lot to do with the Wild West, and it is a little like one. With that said, it is entertaining and it does not take itself too seriously.  You will not be disappointed with the Great White. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a kid I used to love watching "Nightmare Before Christmas." If you have any family members with any interest in horror movies or Halloween, you owe it to yourself to check out "Nightmares" (1993), where the Scary Adventures of Dr. Frank-N-Furter is remade in the style of the original story. As the movie opens, the main character, Frank-Furry, visits his doctor, who is an eccentric old man with a large wart on his face. Frank asks the doctor if he can have some "Frank-n-furter's" (Frank's nickname for himself) and it turns out the doctor actually has a pair of "Frank's" that he keeps hidden away. Frank says that he is just a little boy who has a great fright and asks the old man to give him his Frank's. The old doctor says that "these two Frank's" will probably not have much impact on the human race for years to come. So Frank and his "Frank," who is a little girl with a big red balloon on her back, head out to the countryside, where they encounter a bunch of old couples having a picnic on an open field. Frank thinks they are "scary old couples" but the "Frank" is more concerned about her balloon and starts to have an imagination. The three old couples soon start to fight and Frank says, "We should all run away," while the balloon flies away to safety. After that the story changes and they head to the mountains, where Frank and "Frankly" find a man who claims to have had the same dream the night before. The dream is very disturbing because it shows Frank's evil side in great detail. Frank and Frankly soon find that the mountain where the dream took place is in the middle of a big forest where there are a lot of scary creatures. Frank gets worried when they find a girl (who has been bitten by a rat) tied to a tree with a huge axe stuck through her back. When Frank gets closer he discovers that the axe is a huge piece of wood used to carry off small children. After a lot more trouble, the creature gives up on the girl and starts chasing Frank. The axe gets stuck into Frank again and when he tries to cut the tree, he hits a hole in the ground and the axe falls out! The man looks up and sees the axe coming and runs home to hide. When the monster gets the axe back

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We have two actors playing a character in a low-budget movie whose name was not given. They did a good job.  The movie begins with a news reporter who is going to do a story on an incident where a group of women is held in captivity, raped and beaten by the "villain" who is a serial rapist.  I would have liked to see more scenes like this.    One of the women in the house is going through a lot of abuse and she wants the man who killed her husband to be put on trial.  The police find that he is out on the streets.  He has changed his name to Sami and he is not that nice of a person.  They go to his house and he has a wife and 3 children.  One day he is taken back to his mother's house and when they get out of the car he is wearing a hood or some sort of cloth.  There are a lot more things happening in this movie and in a very entertaining way. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a very well made film.   A lot of the film is about a person who was looking to take his life.  The movie really works on the basis that people do not want to be alone in the world.   The person is actually looking to make this reality by taking his life at all costs.  This film is very well done.  It is quite sad that it was directed by Christopher Nolan.  Nolan does not know how to make a good film.   He has tried all kinds of different things but no one seems to like it.  He has no good script.  There is no real story.  We only see the person's mental problems unfold.   But, it is still very well directed with great performances by a large cast including: Christopher Plummer, Anthony Hopkins, Laurence Olivier, Laurette De Léger and Michael Caine.  I was looking forward to this film because I was a fan of the Batman series.  What I found surprising about this film was how the person changed.  Even the person in question seemed to change.  Now I think it would be nice to see a sequel to this movie.  Posted by JB at 6:18 AM
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best movie ever.  It is the story of a young couple, in a beautiful village, who run away from their home to start a new life. However, they find that their new life is the only thing that seems to be going right.  The movie was so well put together that it had me in tears at the end.  I loved the love story between the two young women: a true tale of the triumph of love. I also loved the fact that it was so long! The pacing was perfect throughout the movie, and I also thought the special effects were really wonderful.    I would recommend this to all ages. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There aren't many movies that work as well as this one does. It takes place on the planet Eutopia, a utopia, full of technology and clean living. But the people there have had a bad experience with violence and drugs, and there has been a lot of death in Eutopian society. The movie is a little hard to watch, at times it is just so hard to believe, but the ending is so beautiful and sad. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film follows a group of college friends on a field trip to visit a mysterious old house (complete with a spooky ghost and a ghostly horse). One of the guys comes home after a bad night of partying and starts having an awful dream. The dream is really bad: The guy wakes up screaming in bed with blood gushing out of his mouth and a blood splatter on his dresser and clothes. The next thing he knows, he is waking up covered in blood. The guys start to get suspicious. Is this just a nightmare? Will we ever find the body? And what happened to those guys?   Unfortunately, the answer to the last question is no: The film is not only about the guys coming to the conclusion that they can't find the house or the body but about the entire house itself and about the weird and supernatural things that are happening in it. The house looks like a really good idea and the guy who goes on the trip is excited about taking a chance on something really old and old-fashioned and then he gets the idea to stay there for three days. After three days of partying, the guys come back and think, "Yeah, we saw some pretty horrible shit out there, but at least we got a good night's sleep." But the house is really creepy and really old-style: There is a ghost at night, and one day he even looks like he is going to come back. There are old dolls everywhere and there are things just waiting to be found. What is really strange is that this weird house is inhabited by a spirit called the "Skeleton Lady," who is really evil: She is always trying to steal a boyfriend's soul and has always been the last one to go to bed. Also, the one guy that stays in the house the longest has always dreamed of an opportunity to kill the Skeleton Lady and so has always tried to do it. He is also the most powerful and the most violent one of the three guys. But he does not go out there a lot because he is afraid of her. His friend, meanwhile, is the one who finds out the house has a secret and tries to break into the place to get the secret out. This is really cool because it shows how much of a secret this place has: the secret is in the skeleton and it's the girl who kills it. So she is the real evil thing in the film. The skeleton is one of those creepy things like the eyes

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I knew I had to see a "Mulan" movie sooner or later. It had been years since I had seen the original, but I remembered it from the movies and I remembered what kind of movie it was. This is a movie so beautiful I would rather have a statue of it standing in front of me than my own life. It is a story about a woman and a man and the story is about both of them trying to figure out what to do when they are given a chance to do something great. It was a little strange, but not to the point of being too confusing. The characters are interesting and they have a little humor mixed in.    The movie also is very well-made. It has a beautiful feel to it, but it is not over-the-top. It just seems like it is telling an interesting story about two different people trying to find their way into the world. The art direction is wonderful. If I were given the opportunity to give a score of this movie, I would give it a 9.3.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think the best thing about The Girl Who Circumnavigated Hell  is not the fact that it's a film about an unearthly being who travels to the earth, but that it was made by the brilliant Roger Corman in the 1970s. What he did is he went through the movies made by Alfred Hitchcock, Alfred Hitchcock's movies being a masterpiece of suspense, which could only be accomplished by the master himself. The Girl who Circumnaves Hell  features a woman who is in search of a young girl to take with her in order to travel to the other side, but the girl is already gone and the girl's father is having a bad day. The poor father can only blame himself for having put his daughter through an ordeal of such incredible evil. The scene where the heroine and the father are meeting each other is a masterpiece. The father and the daughter are dressed in matching outfits, and the camera moves as it does at the beginning of each and every movie of Hitchcock, in order in order not to miss any important moment. After the young girl arrives the father finds himself alone, and he takes out a gun, a rather unusual sight for a man to do in the early hours of the morning. The girl then makes a short speech which is a perfect introduction to the character of The Girl. She is obviously a woman of great intellect and a very good dancer, and when she and her father arrive at the other end the father is at once impressed by the beauty of the creature. It would be impossible for me to explain all the plot details in such a brief summary, so I shall simply give you the essence of what I felt while watching the movie. The idea is that a girl who has come across a group of young devils in order, perhaps, to have a better life than she has had, and has come to the conclusion that it is better that she go away with them. Her father is not enthusiastic about her departure and tells her that he has other things to attend to, but she tells him that her mother is sick and that the other young devils would be a great distraction for her and that they would be very useful to her in any case. To this the father listens to his daughter and agrees to allow her to go with the young devils. He has two conditions which have to be satisfied, firstly that he and the young woman should be naked at all times when in the company of the young devil, and secondly that the young man should

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favorite of the 3 "Hiroshima" films is the one that follows in the footsteps of "Hurt". This is more of a "Hair-Raising" than an "exploitation." You might say "What?" or "What's so good about that?" But what's so bad about that? You can watch it in a hurry: 1. It opens with "The Sound of Silence" by E.W. Benson. I guess that makes me a "bomber." 2. The title says it all. 3. This movie is a "reunion" (at least as many people as the original 2 "Hirshbrigades" and the 2 "G.I. Joe" films are "reunions"). It's not like you've seen a Japanese movie before. It's a film that takes place during the war in Tokyo during a "war" that was really a "business deal" with no "heroes." The "Horn" is really "the Horn" - a "totally harmless" "pet" that is just in the way. This is not to say it doesn't have its moments. There's a wonderful scene when the two spies are trying to get the "good" horn from "the bad" Horn. It seems like a scene I've seen in a John Wayne movie. 4. I really think it would be easy to make this movie "great" simply by making more of it. It would have the good stuff of "The Magnificent Ambersons" in its favor, plus a very good score by the late Frank Sinatra. 5. I think "The Wind" would have been one of the best action films ever made. It was very different and had a very distinct style that still holds up today. I hope we see a remake of this movie soon.

It was kind of hard for me to imagine that this was made in the 80's.  I don't know much about it (except that it's a short film about a boy and a girl going to a high school, and that the girl dies tragically and is the one who gets to go to college, and the boy's got a girlfriend who seems pretty cool and interesting, and we find out later that she's a witch.    ) 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story follows a young man who has recently married his wife and now lives with her. His wife, as she is wont to do, has two children who have been given to her by her parents. After all is said and done, both the wife and son are very unhappy in their new home.  A little boy named Jack who has been in the care of his grandparents since he was a few days old and who just recently turned two.  The same grandmother who has a little girl who lives in the house with her and a little boy.  Also living there is the grandmother's sister, who is the mother of a little daughter who has turned five.  It is a happy and comfortable little neighborhood.  However, the neighbors can't stand the noise and the noise can't be removed from the neighborhood, so after a few years of living together the family gets ready to go into the big city and it would appear to be a short and sweet life of misery and sorrow.  Well, it isn't all bad and it isn the people in the neighborhood and their attitude which is so awful.  But the good comes out of it. A few months after Jack turns four, his grandmother decides to get him a pet.  This dog is a terrier and he will be a very good pet if he can make it.  One day, when Jack is playing in the yard with his dog, a stray dog comes running out and begins to scratch on the neighbor's fence.  Jack immediately goes up to the fence to stop the dog and his grandmother tells him that she doesn't feel so well today and that she will be home in an hour.  So Jack runs back to the backyard, and it is at this point that the dog comes back.  He comes right at Jack with his teeth bared.  You see, the pet, who had gone off to have a good time with his new owner, has decided to bring him back.   It is very difficult to find a positive side to this.  To make things worse, the people who are really at fault for all of this have decided to get Jack's grandmother out of the picture.  They don't want to have to take care of Jack and his new pet and so they try to blame the pet.   One day while Jack is out playing in his yard, the dog is caught by his grandmother and thrown into the back of a car with her family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really had no idea what I was getting myself into with this one, and I'm pretty sure the entire cast, writers, directors, and cinematographers knew exactly what they were going for too. It's an incredibly silly movie which was made for kids and adults alike who can find something funny and amusing within its bizarre and absurdist plot, and of course the movie is also chock full of bizarre and outlandish music and special effects. This movie is so funny, I don't think it's very accurate to be able to describe exactly what it's about, but basically it follows a man who is unable to control his "girly" habits which he sees as a part of who he is. One of these girly habits is getting high on the pot, which he does regularly. He is then pursued by a couple of policemen who stop him by following him to a "weed den", which is a really absurd plot device, but it works so well, and so well it makes me laugh to this very day. There is a song that is sung at the end of the movie as a tribute to the movie's theme, which is definitely something to sing along to. I can't say I've seen this movie, but I would suggest that it would be a lot of fun for an oddball family to watch. Definitely a film for adults with kids and families.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is a great scene where the doctor is talking to an old man as he sits in a rocking chair. The old man starts to sing a song. He goes on and on. Then the doctor looks at him and he has a funny expression on his face, like he is making fun of something or is ashamed of himself. The doctor says, "I will get to the bottom of it one of these days." At that moment he hits on a bit about the old man being deaf. The scene then continues with him walking to a mirror and trying on different glasses until he finds the one that works. That is the old guy with the funny expression. I am not sure who the old people at this movie were. I suppose they were from the neighborhood. (March 19, 1977)

A lot of times when someone is watching this movie they forget that it is a movie and get completely into the story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not prepared for how much a film of a film this was going to be, but a movie really isn't much without any character. When you think about it, there are so many bad choices in the film- it's not like a bad movie that a bad actor plays bad. This is a movie with bad choices- bad acting. It just feels like they had nothing to offer the audience. It's really just a waste of the talent on the film, like when a director tries to make a comedy out of a bad action movie, but then fails to make it funny at all.

First things first,  you have to realize that this was actually made in 1982,   (when I was about 10, I thought it was the "Ultimate Spiderman" movie).   Then you realize that most of this movie takes place over the course of only about three to four minutes,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like this movie or any other that comes to mind, you will like this one as well. A film that tells a tale that many have seen before, that tells the story of a group of people who live in a small town. Their day to day life is nothing special. No, they don't have to deal with gangs or any kind of crime. Their family is decent, and they have a little boy, who is also their pride. They all play together and have a lot of fun. One day a man named George (played by a young John Travolta) shows up at the local diner. George has been missing for a little while and his friends think he was kidnapped. That is until a young girl named Makena (played in the movie by Meryl Streep) is found dead in the woods. She is wearing only one of her favorite pastel colors: pink. George's friend Johnny (played here by a much older John Malkovich) then goes looking for George and finds him being attacked by a killer clown. Johnny is then given an item that looks like a heart, but what it really is a gun that kills any clown that tries to get near it. Johnny kills the clown and the police are called. The police then tell Johnny that they believe George may have been murdered. When Johnny is told to stay away from the clown, he goes back home and tells everyone that the clown is a clown named George. The townspeople are shocked that a clown is dead. Everyone starts to wonder if there really is something to the death of a clown. As they are debating this question the local priest says that George was not a clown, but a spirit that had come to haunt this area. The ghost goes on to tell them that George is just a spirit of a young boy. People come to the priest for help and they are told that they should not trust any of George's family. However, they soon realize that these people have been living in the area for a long time. Everyone is afraid to go out in fear of ghosts. It's not long before George's ghost comes back. George shows up to haunt the priest. The priest tries everything in his power to kill George, but to no avail. At this point the ghost shows up and turns the priest into a statue. As the priest lies there bleeding to death, the ghost turns the people living there into statues and destroys the whole town. This story is so

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After having read the reviews for the first five hours, I couldn't believe the hype. I am so pleased that I got a chance to go to the movies. I can never get enough of the new "Saw" series and this is even better.  In the original "Sawney Bean" the protagonist is an escaped convict who gets into a fight with some police and is shot. The movie follows the man (who was shot) for some time to the point where his life is in danger and the state that he is in is pretty bad. It is a shame that the movie, while showing how dangerous the man is, doesn't have a proper ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot of this film is so silly and yet effective.   A girl named Sarah is on a road trip and wants to go back home because her parents want to divorce. This is obviously all the movie is going to be about.  When they stop for the night at a bar in a small town where the locals are called "Kroos" Sarah and her friend are attacked and killed. But the movie isn't all about that. It tells the story of the girl's relationship with the dead girl's father. The father is so mean and so mean to his daughter that he has to take her on a trip to a remote part of the country where he wants to give her a good scare. Sarah is in love with him but in spite of that, her father does not want her to get married to him. Instead, he wants her to be his wife. Of course he has a few hanky panky affairs to get the attention of a young woman Sarah is attracted to so he can keep his marriage to Sarah. But at the end, he leaves Sarah with the father of the murdered girl to go on another journey. I don't even know what else to say. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "Citizen Kane of the American cinema" is so true to life that every movie maker should have a copy of the film in his or her collection. The movie shows what really is happening in our culture and how we Americans live. The American people are too dumb to know their own country is being invaded. But they are willing to fight a war for someone else's idea of justice. That someone else is a Nazi and the United States is a puppet government to the Nazis. It makes the movie too hard to watch. But that is the purpose of the movie. We all have to live our life like this. In this movie the world is divided into right and wrong, good and bad, and that can be a beautiful thing or it can be just another boring movie. There are a lot of bad movies in the movie but they are all interlaced with good scenes. The good scenes are intercut with scenes from the movie to make the movie funny, and the bad scenes are funny. The ending of the picture should have been longer, but we got it in the end when the Americans do finally get rid of the Nazi. Then we see the movie over again and we watch them win the war. This movie is not for the children to look at. It is for adults. It shows the way this people think. If that is your way of thinking, then you can enjoy the movie and you will have a wonderful life. But if you want to change your way then you will not like it and you can spend the rest of your life wondering what went wrong. There is no movie like this and it will not be made again. It will be a sad day for American movies as that is really the only thing the movie does.

He doesn't succeed. But he also has to take his dog on the road because her owner is in jail.  He also manages to get a little girl pregnant, something she hates because it's against her religion. This is all interspersed with some action sequences (mostly involving motorcycles) and pretty much every action movie ever made.  I gave it two stars because its action is pretty good and it also contains a few funny scenes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie doesn't take a strong stance on gun control. It is much more concerned with crime and punishment. The police chase a crook around, and are frustrated and confused. They don't understand why a guy gets away with a murder, and in fact, they try to do some police work in the hope of catching a suspect.  But it's so bad that you can't help feeling like they ought to have let someone else do the job instead.   Recommendation:  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was never in love with Michael Cimino, although it is very hard to love the director's "The Deer Hunter", although I love his first film as well. But then, I thought of a movie by the late William S. Hart and thought about how much the late Hart could have improved the movie. And so I thought, since it's a war movie, why not make it a bit more realistic. What I saw in this movie is not as realistic as it is to me.   So I don't like this movie, but it is good for the time period.

It has all the elements of a classic: the old school style of a Spielberg movie, a great cast, and a solid cast of actors playing the old favorites. If you don't mind old school Spielberg, this is a must-see. It may not be an original idea, but I've still got a great time with it. The music is good and the story is good, so watch this one and enjoy.   Oh, yeah, you have to see the trailer. It is absolutely awesome.

It was a low budget exploitation movie that had this black guy with red hair who was constantly on his knees trying to kiss the girls, all the while being tortured by the same creepy woman.  I wasn't sure about that and I am glad that I got to see it again! The story and acting are decent and I loved the "tender heart, hard body, rough skin" stuff, a real genre staple.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has a great ending and a good story. I loved the film for what it was. It was a good action film, but it had a plot twist that I thought was very unexpected. It definitely had a very high concept. It gave us an interesting world where the aliens, called the Xilians, ruled the planet with an iron fist. In an effort to keep their planet from going over to the dark side, the XILians decided to create a race of superpowered humans. They gave the chosen children a unique power, called Superbeings. These kids were all gifted with amazing abilities, the strongest and the most intelligent ever in the history of science. It didn't take long for the XILS to start conquering the universe. However, the real reason these aliens were feared was because they had no empathy or sympathy. Every time they killed someone or hurt an innocent life, they would simply turn around and kill the next. Not only that, but the Xils were willing to commit genocide, when they felt it was the right thing to do. Their actions were very cold and calculated. It showed how evil these creatures were. The Xils seemed to think they had it all, a perfect world of peace, happiness, and prosperity. It's only a matter of time before those dreams are shattered by the forces of nature.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie about 7 years ago, when it came out in Japan. I was only 5 or 6 then, but I watched it a couple of times and it just seemed kind of funny. I know the plot isn't great, but it does work and I liked it a lot. One of my favorite movies of all time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be completely fair, the movie that we see has some pretty good dialogue, a little bit of action. But it also has one of the best endings to a movie, that I've seen in a long time. It also has a lot of humor. What more could you ask for, right? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In fact I think this is actually the best movie about love, romance, lust and romance. It is a beautifully acted movie. There is more lust, more love and more sex in the movie than in most novels or poems I know about. The plot is very simple. In an old town there is a bar called Elvira's (the name is Latin for "Love") where people have come to spend the night. One night a girl, Anna, meets a man, Sam, who is a musician. She is very attracted to him. When she leaves him she asks him: "Do I have to take the bus home?" And Sam says no, she can walk to a bar where a beautiful woman, Elvire, is dancing. Anna and Sam dance on stage with Elviren and they have a very romantic and beautiful dance. There are many close ups of their dance. Anna is very moved. Sam asks Anna to marry him. She says yes. But the wedding is not in a church or at a church but in Elvir's bar. She wants her father to come too. The father comes and Anna meets him on the dancefloor. Then Sam and Elviri dance more. The audience sees how romantic it all is. Anna decides she wants to marry Sam. But Anna's father, Elvir, is afraid that if she goes to her parents it will be all over. He is not happy that Anna is to be married at a bar, in a country place where it is the custom for young people to have a few drinks and make love. And so Elvir decides to ask Anna's mother, Anna's great uncle, to go to the town. Anna's parents cannot go and so Anna's uncle goes himself and meets Sam at the bar. Anna, Sam and the father all go to a little inn. There Anna's Aunt, Olvida, comes in and she is very upset. She doesn't want Anna to get married. Anna says it is not a matter of choice and she wants it. Anna then gives a dance lesson to Sam. Then Anna and Elviare kiss and elvire dances with Anna's Uncle. The uncle is sad. But as he is about to leave, his niece and his great aunt get into a row and start to argue. Sam tells the uncle he is going to go home. Elvir leaves to return to his town. Then he goes to Elvie's bar where he kisses Anna

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie has some good performances, and they all are very good. John Carradine's character, "Frankenstein" has a great, funny and convincing portrayal. As a matter of fact, one of the more memorable scenes in the movie happens when the Doctor, who is still in a wheelchair, gets up and starts walking again. I also like the story of how "Frankensteine" was created.    For those who have not seen this movie, I highly recommend it. It is a fun, but not too serious movie with good acting, good effects, good humor, and a lot of action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So let me start by saying that while I didn't watch this movie all that much, it is a movie of a very high quality.   For the first half of the movie we are given a look into the life of a girl who is living at home because her father doesn't allow her to go out.  She meets an older man named Peter who helps her out and then she runs away and becomes friends with someone and later finds out that she has a little brother.  And then she gets back to her father and they talk and then we have the little girl run away again and she meets a different boy who is the leader of a gang called the Bloods, and the two of them are going to steal some drugs from the drug house and run away with it.  But the Blood gang, being the tough guys, get caught in a traffic jam at a traffic light and the kid jumps from the car and saves the day.  However, the next time she sees him, he is gone and the gang is dead.  There's a flashback to the first time they run away from home and then a flashback of her father's murder.  Now she runs back to the drug dealer's house.  Then we have a little girl who tries to go to a movie.  She gets in the car, starts the engine, and then stops the car.  The next scene takes place on a bridge, when a little boy runs up to her and says "Help me!  There is a man on the side of the highway, and he is trying to get me off."  So the little kid pulls out a knife and says that the man is an angry old man, and that he is going to kill her.  Unfortunately the old man catches up to them and kills the little boy (he was the one trying to kill the girl) and then he goes back to his car to get a drink.  Eventually she goes home and she has the blood on her clothes so she doesn't get in trouble for running away.  Finally the little sister tries to get the money from the gangster by saying "I'll sell you five ounces.  That's more than you're worth."  Of course the gangsters say "No, we want more.  We're gonna have to break your little sister in half,  then cut out her heart."  And so they do.  It's a very good movie, and I give
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The good old "V" is still kicking, folks!  Not only is it still going strong, but now its got a new wrinkle:      The new "Vampire" series is even creepier than the first movie, which was actually one of my favorite films in the late 80's.  We got the old "Pennywise the Clown" (played by Stephen King), who is being forced back into his closet by his sister, Beverly.    It appears Beverly is also a vampiric being, but she is not a true vampire.  If you're wondering what Pennywise and Beverly look like, then you need to get a hold of yourself, because I'm about to reveal something you'll find absolutely terrifying!   I don't know where to begin, really.  It seems that in each installment of the new "Twilight" series we are introduced to a new creature, which is usually either a werewolf, ghoul, or something else that has a supernatural aspect to it.  The first "Twin Peaks" featured the Black Lodge, and the new series is all about the "Wizard of Oz."   So if it seems like there are a LOT of new creatures this year, there is a reason for it.     This new series comes in the form of a feature length film, which means it takes a LONG time to get into the action.  Now, this is not the same old series in which "Twelve Monkeys" came out in 1983, which had a very short and sweet story that took only about 45 minutes.  This is a feature film, and it is a LONG movie.  There are a lot of scenes in "Twenty-Four Eyes" that last for a good hour or more.  As I said earlier, I have watched "Twins" and "Twixt" and all of the sequels.  And this is just a taste of what we get.  Oh, and by the way, if you haven't seen this, then I'll tell you what it is!        "Twenties" was written by Richard Matheson (a friend of King's), and directed by John Landis.  King originally wanted "Twinnies" to be his final film (he died in January 1988), but then the studio (New Line Cinema) thought it would be a more appealing film for a late 1990

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those old timey movies that have gone through many remakes and were so popular that they have made them into remakes of the remake. This movie takes a different angle and takes the story back to the late 1800s. There is no action as it is all shown in the old western style with the characters walking and talking about things that interest them. I would like to see how the story was put together or just what is the deal with this movie and that old woman. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot was decent, and it was a very well done story.     It wasn't exactly a story of war, and the movie does give us a little bit more information about the conflict than the book.  While it was nice to see a real war, it didn't do it justice.    The characters in the movie were well written, but it didn.t do it for me.  They were well drawn and realistic, but did they have enough of a sense of realism to make me feel something?   I'm not so sure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a way, there is a certain sense of foreshadowing going on here, because the movie begins with an interesting sequence:  The film opens with a woman walking through an alley. She is having a bad day. She has been hit by a car while walking home from work and a man (who is a bit mysterious and very good looking) pulls up next to her and asks her for a lift. Of course, he's driving a car, and so it is difficult to walk to get there. So this woman is forced to walk. (Which isn't so bad, actually.) But then she passes an interesting bit of film:   The woman is a child psychologist, but she has lost her way. She's working at a home where she meets a young boy (played by a very nice and adorable Peter Sarsgaard), who has become confused about who he is and what his father really did. He is clearly an orphan: he has no father; he has been abandoned by his dad and his sister (who doesn't seem to care about the boy); and his mother is sick; although, of course, her daughter has an interest in him. In other words, the woman has found a child with a broken and dysfunctional family. (She also has a lot of help in the film from her best friend, but that part does not interest me; I found Sarsgard's performance so endearing, he had to be included in the movie. The child psychologist might have made a good role.) The movie then switches gears to follow the boy, his father, and his friends.   But the boy's father is a much more interesting character. We learn a little more about his life, and it is rather sad and depressing.   The movie also features a few flashbacks to the boy and his father's relationship, but these flashbacks are brief and don't really do anything.   It's probably fair to say that this is more of a tragedy than a comedy in the main story. It's sad when you start looking at the circumstances surrounding the boy:  At first, the father seems to have the boy in his care.   But he is, in reality, very unfaithful to his son, but he thinks that he is trying to be an ideal husband and father, so he is willing to be with him.  But what he does with the boy is very disturbing.  His relationship with the son starts out as innocent and sweet.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think it is a brilliant work of art.   This film is not only a science fiction movie.  The aliens don't come here to steal our gold coins.  They are trying to warn us about the coming catastrophe that will sweep the planet.  When they appear, their appearance and attitude are very strange.  And the film is highly entertaining.  One of my favorite films from the 70s.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm glad I was able to catch this one, in that it's not often I get to see a movie in which the male lead is a woman. I haven't seen a movie where one character is a women and the other is a man in quite a while. It also wasn't a happy movie: in fact, it was quite grim. I really don't think women want to be abused like this. At least, not all the women are in love with the bad guy. The only one he seems to genuinely love is his wife: at least that's what we're told she wants to be.   And as she says, "I don't know if it's love or sex, it doesn't matter because she likes to sleep with him when she has to. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a little hard to find a good independent movie from China in my opinion. It's not one of those big blockbusters that you see in the US.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about the life of a middle-aged woman named Mary Sue.   Mary Sue is the kind of woman that would like nothing better than to be a model and get along in her career.  This is her dream come true, her dream since she was very young.  Before getting married, she did some modeling work to help pay for college.  Then she gets divorced and decides to stay at home.  But what's Mary Sue's life like after getting divorced?  Her marriage ends and she becomes a single mother to a young boy.  She is now working as a receptionist.  In those days, Mary Sue was quite a bit older, and could work from anywhere at the office.  Mary is a very good receptionist and a good mother, but she has a big problem to face.  Since getting married she has had two more kids, and they have both been put into foster care.  And Mary Sue has to take care of them.  So this is the life Mary Sue lives, and it is a bit different from what the movies usually portray.  If it were not for the help of other workers in the office, Mary would not last a year.  It is not easy to get by on minimum wage, and at any one time there are a lot of mouths to feed.  Her home life isn't much better.  One can be sure there are days that Mary Sue can hardly stand.  With the children gone and her son's foster parents not even giving her time, Mary has no choice but to go on welfare.  Despite the lack of work and money, Mary is always upbeat about how she is living.  After her last check comes, she has more in the bank than she ever expected, yet still she continues to live like a pauper.  At the end of the movie, we learn that she had become addicted to taking drugs and alcohol.  When she was sober, it seemed that everything would be fine.  Now that she has been taking drugs for over a year she is in serious trouble, not only with her children, but also with herself.  Is the movie a comedy?  No, because it is not a bad movie at all.  The story has some funny moments, but even those can't overshadow the fact that the movie is not an easy watch.  That is why I gave it 3 stars. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie. I don't know why my girlfriend hated it so much but she did. My only disappointment about the movie was that it ended too soon. I really loved the character of the narrator. I had to look up his name on the internet once in a while to make sure I wasn't imagining it, and he is not as bad as I thought he'd be. That last minute speech when he says, "You're not alone in your struggles," was the only thing that bothered me about the film. I wish it had gone on. There is a lot more to say about this movie than I could fit in here, but I hope you'll enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed watching it.

The movie is set in 1960s New England, and there are lots of familiar, if not quite recognizable, locations. There are lots and lots of young lovers who are so close that they make a pretty close pair. If this movie gets you to remember New England of the 1950s, it will be a good trip.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know about you, but I am a massive fan of The Shawshank Redemption. It is, without a doubt, one of the most important and influential films ever made. It's not only brilliant, but incredibly sad at the same time. I can't imagine anything more heart-wrenching than the end of one's life, not a single thought of hope or joy. For most of the story, it's pretty easy to see that The Shaw SHank is not just another tragic story. But it is. And it is a very good film. In the final part of the film, when we finally get to see the full consequences of one man's act of mercy, the film turns into a sad, painful one. The whole film becomes a lesson, and it is difficult to separate the positive from the negative. It also has some great action scenes, some great music, some hilarious moments, and a great ending that will haunt you for a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For a film made in the 1970s to the late 1980s that is, still a classic of classic movie genres, this movie still has its best elements in it. I like to watch "Mr. Magoo" after a good show (if I had to choose just one) from "Mr Dancer." "Mr Magoo's" the story of a young magician (as his name indicates) who is a member of a traveling circus. At one point in this movie a man dressed like a magician enters the ring. The magician sees one of his tricks and, after a few tricks, tries to find a way back to the other side of the curtain. His plan doesn't work very well. He is hit with a bad blow that knocks him down. The man who has been disguised as a magician is able to pull out an item in the ceiling that causes the floor above to collapse. He then climbs up onto the roof of the circus and flies down over the audience. The curtain, which had been drawn across the magician's face, has to be pulled aside, exposing the magician. As he does this he drops one of the props that are falling to the floor of the ring below. It is not the first time this trick has been done, so as he falls the magician, wearing his old-fashioned hat, manages to get to the ground and land on one of a number of rings on the ceiling. Unfortunately for the magician as he does so, one of those rings is not a regular size ring but a giant ring. Not only does the magician fall through the ceiling of the hall into the audience, but he hits a woman on the head. This is enough to make him want to pull the other trick he has up on the ring and then find his way back up. When he has finally made his way down the ring he finds himself in a room with a curtain. It has been drawn in front of the magician and on the floor is the ring which has been pulled into the ceiling, not far from the magician himself. This has caused him to fall through it, landing next to the magician who is now also out of the audience and in a very unpleasant situation. The two men then try to make their way back out into the auditorium. The ceiling has collapsed in on themselves and they can only be rescued by an elephant who is trying to move the ring across the ring floor with the help of an elevator. This, of course, doesn't do the trick

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The main character of the movie is the daughter of a retired high-level police detective (played by Tom Cruise) who becomes a high-school instructor and who is soon promoted to the role of assistant principal at a fairly well-to-do suburban school.   A couple of times throughout the movie Cruise attempts to do something with the movie's plot that he could not actually execute in real life, e.g., to give the plot some more color by showing a little more of the beautiful, middle-class neighborhood.  His attempts are also mostly amusing, in which he does something at the end that would not have been interesting had it happened in real-life: he shows the two kids running away from the school as they walk past a police car.  At another point, the children do run past a policeman and a young boy and the policeman and the child run together up to him.  In addition to having a couple of fun moments, the movie also contains some nicely told stories (which make a more sophisticated and realistic movie about teenage high-society life in the 1930's look much simpler than it really is), and it does show a couple things about high-ranking police officers who did not exactly know what was going on in the "big world" in the 1920's and '30's.  This movie is a little too sentimental for me, and it also contains a lot of what I would call a "fluff piece" of high-class, fashionable life; but to be honest, I find that I am just as much impressed with Tom Cruise's acting as I am with his acting as a character from a James Bond movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just had to stop watching The Dark Knight. That is a lot of money for a lousy movie. I thought the story was silly. It was just ridiculous to me. It seemed like the director was trying to outdo himself with each film he made. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Batman fights his way through some bad guys. He does a number of martial arts moves. And then there is a scene with Batman in his cape and cape and a tuxedo chasing a guy in a tatooed suit. It is all very ridiculous. The story is not funny at all and the characters are not interesting at all. I do not like these type of movies.

Good movie, bad ending  By james ludlow on August 20, 2005 - 3:30pm: i thought this was a pretty good movie, the music in particular was good. there were a few things that were a little bit of a letdown. One was the ending, where an actor gets gunned down outside, and the movie just ends, leaving us with the question "who killed the guy". the ending also left the audience with the bad feeling that it was an unnecessary action-packed conclusion. i thought it was unfortunate that the movie left us with a dead guy. as it is the main character was a very decent guy, he had an interesting story to tell, and a great final scene. i think the movie could have been better if it had kept the plot going to the end, but then it really could have worked. if you like action movies with strong female characters and some really good action this is definitely a movie to watch!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I must say that I don't usually like horror films that don't have anything to do with zombies or serial killers. This one is good, though.   It stars a nice guy, Jason Robards, as a man who has the bad luck of marrying a woman who is a very, very attractive woman.  She likes to eat men.  So, when she's suddenly killed by an arrow, Robards is left to wander around alone in the woods. He wanders aimlessly until he encounters the same arrow that killed his wife.  And, of course, he kills the arrow too.  This is a good story, and a good horror film.  This was a good, fast-paced movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just watched the movie "Kung Fu Hustle", directed by Yuen Woo-Ping and stars Jackie Chan. The movie has Chan as he is in the early 90's. His character is called "Tiger's Eye", and he fights the good fight. There's some fight scenes in the movie which are very entertaining to watch. The story starts with a rich girl named Lee who was kidnapped and raped by a gangster (Shitam Chor, played by Johnny Chow). Lee's mother who had been a nurse for 20 years and was also a sex worker finds the ransom money, but she cannot afford to pay the ransom and the gangster sets Lee free. Lee's mom then sets out to find a guy to help her raise a daughter and Lee is her first choice. However Lee is a very good fighter and so he joins a Kung Fu school where he gets to train with the other students. Eventually Lee finds a man who fights like Jackie Chan (who is now also a Kungfu master and is in prison) and Lee can't believe his eyes. Lee decides that he wants to become a Kungfuhrer (kung fu master) and joins a school run by Kungfu Master Chang. Chan and Chang work together to train Lee and they form an unbeatable duo and Chan is constantly looking for money so he can go back to the whorehouse that his father owned (which is now owned by a very rich Chinese gangster). The movie is pretty good and the story is very good (especially for a 90's movie) with a good cast of actors, but you need to read the book to really get the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those of you looking for a good old-fashioned western, don't worry! This one is very entertaining, and the acting is fantastic. The film is a good mix of high adventure/low humor. Some interesting ideas are presented, and they are executed well. There are plenty of laughs and some great scenes in the film. A lot of the humor is "gag-like" - but the way in which the humor works is very funny. One really cannot put down this film... It is a great mix of humor, romance, high adventure, and even some good gore. This is a film you cannot afford to miss.   Reviewed by Mark from Fort Wayne IN, USA

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film follows a character as he finds himself trapped and struggling to survive in a besieged city on the brink of death.  The movie's set in the late 16th Century where a plague hits London with a particularly devastating effect upon the city's citizens.  There is no shortage of tension.  This is a movie to be seen in a theater with the lights turned down.  Director Christopher Nolan is a good director with a knack for storytelling.  If you like movies with a high degree of tension and suspense, and a good amount of blood, then you will like The Dark Knight Rises.

This is a great film and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoyed the film "The Matrix" or the film, "The Bourne Identity." Both of these films are great movies and I am glad that the next two films in the "Dark Knight" franchise will not disappoint me. This film had an amazing performance from the great Christopher Nolan. My only complaint was the ending. It felt like it should be a continuation of the trilogy. However, that is where the disappointment ends. The Dark Knight: Rises is an action packed film and there is a lot of action in it. I would like to see Nolan return to the Batman franchise and I also would like him to try some different characters such as a corrupt politician or a psychotic assassin.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was never a fan of the James Bond films or television shows.  However the first one was so good and funny and a great character study that my love for the character was rekindled!  This is a good film but I think it could have been better.  As an audience member one can empathize with Dr. No and all he does is to try to stop all the bad guys but the movie doesn't really work.  There are a number of very good scenes with the 007 character and he looks so much like a younger version of Paul Newman when he was playing the Bond character.  This would be an excellent film if it had a good villain.  One would like to see the film in 3D which has only come out recently.   - I'd like to thank the folks at The Criterion Collection for providing a copy of this film to me for a review. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a movie that is both fun to watch and quite good at making its point.  There are a lot of martial arts scenes in this movie, but when the movie is not in fight scenes, the plot unfolds in a fairly conventional way.    The story is one that I haven't seen before.  The story of an orphan who is the son of a blacksmith in the small town of Shenkui in rural China.  He is adopted by a rich man, Chen Tien, who has a young daughter.  His daughter is called Li Yu and is the daughter of a peasant whose family has a small fortune that she inherited from her aunt, the Empress of China.  The protagonist is an orphan too, and is an only son, though his father was the blacksmith, and thus the heir.    A year later he is sent to a boarding school that is supposed to teach him to read, but instead he learns how to fight by watching his father fight.  Eventually the other students realize that the hero is the "champion," and start fighting against him, and the story moves on into the next stage.  This movie does not have a whole lot in the way of martial action, though it does have a fair amount of fighting.  There are three fights in the movie.  One fight is a fight between the villain and the protagonist which is quite interesting, but is interrupted when he is taken from the fighting ring by his "mother", which is a young woman that has been taken from a poor family and is trying to earn her way to the rich family.  Next is a duel between the "Champion" and a Chinese girl, Li Yu, in which she uses a whip, and this leads to a fight with the boy, where the boy is wounded and injured (and his face is burned off) and then gets captured by the "Master," who has come to rescue him.  Then there is the most enjoyable fight, and you will never see a fight quite like it again.  It is a sword fight between some of the black-clad, trained guards in front of the Empress' palace.  All the guards are dressed in black suits, and there are two of them in each suit, and they don't really give a damn what is going on.  They are waiting to face off against the Empress, who is in a black velvet robe, but there is
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm sure there are tons of people who didn't find much humor in the film because there wasn't enough of it and also the movie was pretty boring for an action comedy:  The main character was a lot like a more violent version of Batman, but that's a different thing:  In a nutshell, this was a film with an action genre, but without a lot of laughs:  It was too much of the same, which makes me think there was a reason the producers had gone with the same director for the sequel.  Some of the characters in the movie were very well done, but the action was too repetitive, so it was hard to get invested in the story at times and it never became a good character study:   If this was like the first sequel, then it would have a lot more substance: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of classic horror movies from the '40s and '50s and as I was thinking about some of my favorite horror films of the past, I happened to see this.   The movie is basically a bunch of people in a room going nuts.  As the movie progresses, it begins to look more and more like something out of a campy '50's TV show and as the suspense builds and build, the movie becomes more and a bit more macabre as the horror starts to go into a whole other realm.  The music is absolutely creepy. The movie also has a very weird ending that isn't really in the film at all but it is very scary to look back and see what all happened.  I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy scary movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't have much to say about this film. A good man falls in love, gets into a car accident, gets a new job, gets married, has a child and eventually dies. The movie is full of life. If you like a good old fashioned love story then this is for you. If I had to rate this movie one to five, I would call it an even, five. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you love a good laugh, you're in for a treat here.  Takes you back to the times of the 1950's.    This is a fun little film that has enough to keep your heart pounding for a few more minutes.  Enjoy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "Avengers" have found a way to get their own movie made.   I did not like the first "A" movie, but it's a good, clean, action packed movie with great acting, and a fun idea: the Avengers would work together to try to stop a powerful alien force from destroying our Earth.  It's a clever little comedy that keeps it straight, while introducing a new group of heroes: Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), a little girl named Vision (Paul Bettany) and the new Thor.  The story involves a bad guy named General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross (Jeff Goldblum) who has taken over the government for nefarious purposes. The other bad guy is named Loki (Tom Hiddleston).  The best part of the film?  At the end, the Avengers save the day, but that takes them right back to the city!  It was fun as hell, and an effective way to tie in the two Avengers movies.  And, as always, Jeremy Renner is good.  (8 out of 10)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a film where everything just feels right. There are not many films that come at the time, and still feel like they could still be making movies like they were 25 years ago. This is the one film that is as old as time itself. The characters are so memorable that they will likely have a long life in cinema lore.  I have had this in my head for a while and wanted to finally see it. This review might sound a little harsh, and I will not deny that. It is not a movie to sit back and relax to with a nice cup of tea. It's a film that demands to be watched.  What this movie does is it does something that no other film in the history of cinema has done. It manages to combine the beauty and mystery of old stories with the mystery and horror of modern horror. You might not be able to find a copy of this movie, but I promise that this film will live long in the memory.  Rating:  ****
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't enjoy this movie very much when I saw it. The acting is terrible, the story is too dumb, and the movie is just boring. This movie is so bad it makes my childhood films seem good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It isn't often that I find myself in the mood to watch a film that is about an entire community of people who are completely disconnected from the rest of the world. In the film, we see a town called "Amber", a town where the average working man lives and where the woman has to look to the city to have a good time. The two characters that we meet are a trucker named George and a woman named Cindy. George has had it up to here with the town and the way things are going. The men are a little short but don't seem to care about the ladies. The town has more men than women. It isn´t that the women are unattractive or anything else but it does seem to come natural. George and Cindy do their job. It is a little bit difficult at times but they do the best they can. They get by with a little money from selling flowers. George is a bad driver and sometimes has to stay in the truck. This puts a strain on the relationship that they have. He also gets a little annoyed at how Cindy never stops with the flowers. They drive a little way around town every day to try and do some gardening and a little more flower picking but it isn´T a good enough job. This is the movie that I wish I could find but I can´T. It seems that this is something that everyone who lives and works in the town talks about but no one cares about. A good job in Amber isn´ t enough to keep you happy. A few times we are treated to a shot of the desert that seems a perfect setting for a movie. There is little else that has anything to do with the film besides the fact that we go to the desert and that George gets a lot of flowers.   In all honesty, I don´t think it is the perfect movie to make you feel at home and I think it does a fairly good job to depict the small time, lonely life of a few people who live in a small town. The ending is a bit sad but there is nothing left to do but laugh a little at the absurdity of it all. I found the character of Cindy to be very endearing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An old-time, low-budget movie about a girl and a girl's dog who are going to go to the carnival together.   This is just a silly romantic comedy, but there is a cute and funny girl (I don't know if I'd call her an actor or an actress) who loves animals and the old carnival. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To understand the power of a cult movie is to realize just how easy it is for a Hollywood product to make the transition from TV to the big screen. But if you are a fan of cult, forget the "prestige" and stick out a right hand in solidarity with the new generation of cult filmmakers -- the likes of Michael Rooker, Nicolas Cage, David Carradine, and the late Tim Robbins. This is the kind of movie that gets you in the mood with a quick bit of acting, with a few good one liners to round out the movie, and a couple of great songs (which, for better and for worse, don't quite translate into the film) -- and then it's off to the races -- just for a few minutes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen the movie but I do remember that the guy looks like the Hulk in that movie. I was pretty young then so I don't know how long this film was going to run but it was at least a good time. I like that the actor played it straight but I don"t think it was funny and I don "t think you can put me at a party with a bunch of guys at a bar and get that laugh out of me any more.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm very pleased with the way this movie looks.   It does have a lot of nice music in it so it does look the part of the war movie.  It is about a man who is trying to protect a very beautiful young girl from being killed by a sniper.  His only hope is to get to the girl's sister so they can stop the sniper. However the sniper is not letting them out of his sight so this man will have to make his way to the sister to stop the girl in time.  And yes, this film is very realistic because it is about real people in real places trying to take their lives back from snipers like that.  The real war that is shown in this film were really intense because soldiers were really in some very dangerous places where the people were really really scared because they were not sure that they would live anymore.  In fact a young man was killed while trying to kill the girl so he is never shown again in the film.  I did like the music as well.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's no doubt that this is a good film, and for that matter a great one. The story is good, the acting is good and the music is great. I wish we had seen more of the world of the children.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a year that was already full of great movies, A Man Called Horse has stood out.  We are used to seeing films like the one in which a man is shot and killed in a movie theatre in a town where horses are common place and you almost expect it to happen there.    But the movie does something different, the man in question is actually a horse and even the movie's director, Richard E. Grant  has some respect for a horse.  After he does that, he does what he can to keep the audience entertained until the end.  This is a short but memorable movie with a plot that is very interesting and I am sure that it will find a place in my collection. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have no idea how the hell this film is rated, but it isn't really a terrible movie, it does the best job it can of not being a terrible film, which is hard in a film like this because a truly horrible movie is usually pretty boring.   In a lot of ways I liked it, because I did like the story about the two boys, and I liked a lot about the directing, it was an effective film, and the film is good enough to be a worthwhile movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found The Crow's second installment to be a really fun film.   At first it wasn't as much of a surprise since I was expecting the sequel to the 2008 release but this film has something different and better.  One of the best things about this film is that you don't need to be familiar with the source material in order to enjoy it.  You can watch this film and then watch the original as well, and you don,t need to know where the movie came from.  The action scenes are pretty well shot with a lot of great set pieces and stuntwork, and the film has all the elements one would expect from the first installment.  This film is certainly one for the ages and I can't wait to see where The Crow goes from here. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The idea that these three old geezers are going to take over the world is pretty much the dream of every child. These guys are old-fart jokes that run around yelling at the top of their lungs to people around them. There are a few jokes, but they are pretty bad and in no way funny at all. The ending to the film is pretty ridiculous, with the old guy telling the kids to "Come and get a hug" (as if the kids are going out to look for a hug), and they say that if they get a hold of this movie (which I doubt they will), they will make it famous.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only real bad thing I can say about the movie is that there was some kind of anachronism in the background.   At the beginning the movie was shot backwards in time.  So this was a movie about an explorer who finds himself trapped in the past and has to solve a mystery.  The only problem is that the movie has no dialogue, and so the movie doesn't actually tell a story.  There's a pretty good story here, but you have to ignore all the time travel nonsense to really get to the point. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The cast is all strong, from the director and the actress (I do like the new, modern Audrey Hepburn), and the script is a lot of fun, with a good plot that will keep you guessing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you like movies like this one, you will really enjoy the rest of the movie.     A bit too slow for my taste, it has that same feeling that you get from one of those movies where an old guy goes off for a walk and the little kids run off with the old guy.   The movie opens up with a narration and then we see a little girl on a bicycle, she is about twelve and she is on her way to a new school.    The school is run by a lady, and there is a sign hanging in the window that says, " The Most Beautiful Girls in the World".   The next thing I know we see the old lady going out on the balcony to a group of girls.  These girls are about 14 or 15 years old, we are not told how old they are, but they look to be fairly attractive.  One of the girls looks like a young Jennifer Connelly, the other one looks like the young actress who plays Sarah Connor in the Terminator series.  The old lady and the kids talk about their days at school. Then the old woman comes back into the house and tells the kids, "You don't have to stay up all night, we have nice food and we can have good times and enjoy each other's company. We can laugh together and sing."  We see a bunch of boys playing the drums in the back yard and some of them talk about how nice their parents are.  Then we see more of the old women sitting around with the kids.  They all sit together in a circle and play music and dance together.  It's pretty cool, and it's just the kind of thing you would imagine would happen in a small town.  Now, I'm not sure that the kids are really old enough to go to school here, but I suppose they're old enough for their parents to have a nice time.  This movie is really good, and is one of the better movies of 2001. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot is pretty simple:  A man tries to rob a house; the police arrive and make a scene; the robber, who is black, escapes. The movie is very well written, with some great actors, it's easy to follow the story, which is pretty good, but the plot is a little weak. There are a lot of very strong characters: the cops, the robbers, the woman who is married to one, the kids (they're all black and they all talk like black people), and the wife who is an old hippie who smokes pot and listens to jazz music and listens and listens. They're all just as important as the robbers: the black man is a real leader, the policeman is funny, and the hippie woman is the most wonderful woman I have ever seen. It's a very good movie, but I wouldn't recommend it to young people. It has a lot more violence than you want to see, and there's lots of bad language, which will probably scare some people off. There's also a couple of short scenes that are really bad; they seem to be from a different movie, which I'm not familiar with. But this movie is entertaining to watch, and a very interesting one, too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an old movie, but it gets a new lease on life. It is more than a little surprising how it does so. The movie is not quite as good as the first one or the second, but that is to be expected. It has a rather generic and unexciting plot, which has one person, a police officer who has come down with a serious ailment that is probably nothing at all serious, and a girl who wants to be a nurse who tries to get him out of the hospital. It was funny at the time, but not nearly as funny now. The plot does nothing but try and be funny by having its hero get involved with a bunch of women who are not funny at all. The only character in the movie that is very funny is the guy with the glasses, and he doesn't even really do anything to save the movie from being an awful train wreck.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One thing is certain, in the post-apocalyptic movie "The Road", there's a scene that I will never forget. In one scene in a bar, it is clear that these characters are not "relying" on the good times they will have in the future. They have a good time for a while and then one of them gets a bit drunk. But he gets up and walks to a table. What happened after that was not clear. The only thing we know is that the person got up and drank some more. It seems as if the "reluctant drinker" will have a few more drinks than his friend and we all went back to our seats.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie! This movie is just a masterpiece. It has everything you would want in a good old fashioned horror movie. The best way to describe this movie is as if a group of misfits got together and started a group called "The Ghost of Chateau Lafitte". The movie features a group that looks like it was formed for a weekend of partying. If you liked The Ring I have to say this movie comes close in the fact that it has a similar feel. The movie has some beautiful scenes as well as some great scary moments. This movie has it all! I really do recommend this movie to anyone who can see the greatness this movie has to offer.   Note: This movie only takes around 20 minutes to get through so I highly recommend watching it while you go through the whole movie. I found the film to be much more scary than The Ring in the beginning. I am not sure if that is a good thing or not.  .
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about a guy who loves animals and wants to be an animal trainer.  This is not too bad a movie (although the ending is very predictable, as well).   If you have a weakness for cute animals, then this is the movie for you!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first thing that comes to mind about   is the "B" word. It sounds good, and the ending is great, but the story leaves much to be desired.   When the story begins, we're introduced to the title character, an unnamed, but very pretty, high-schooler. She has a boyfriend in a foreign country, she has a secret crush on a mysterious guy, she's in love with the school bully, and she seems to be a little lost at times. Then she meets a man in a bar who tells her everything she's ever wanted to know about life. His name is "S," and she can only call him by her middle name of "George." He seems to know everything about her life, her mother, how to take care of her father, and where she could find some cool guys to date.  And then, just when it seems to get interesting, she gets kidnapped by a girl named Miss Fritter, and S is left to figure out what to do.  While it's not completely impossible to figure things out on your own, I find it rather hard, and not so interesting. The movie seems to assume a lot from you that it doesn't actually need: that you're intelligent, well-read, and a bit of a romantic. All of these things are true of some people, but S's intelligence and background are not, and her knowledge about the world is very limited. But even as she gets lost and confused, S's boyfriend tells her the story of his life. It's a story about a "girl," which may be the only explanation for S's interest in this guy.  Despite the poor story and clunky dialogue, I did find it pretty funny, and it gets funnier the more you think about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love films and I love a good British comedy and this was certainly one of the best. There's a lot of comedy to be had in a film this brief, but it's all done with a smile. This is definitely one to go out and watch. It's a film that'll keep you laughing until your eyes are watery and your jaw is on the floor. It doesn't quite work as a straight comedy, but then comedy doesn't need to, as it just does the things that are funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After a decade and a half of development and one big break, the long-delayed sequel to the seminal 1990 film The Terminator is finally here, with the promise of more of the Terminator as a kind of super-hero. This time, with Arnold Schwarzenegger, he'll have more than one way of making a movie: he's a cop, a politician, a doctor and a soldier and they've all got their own agendas, their own ways of doing things, their way of looking at the world. The film was directed by Robert Altman (whose film The Player might be of some interest to movie aficionados) and produced by Francis Ford Coppola, and I think that, if you're a fan of the first one, you will find a lot to love in this one. And, if it does have one fault, it's that I don't think it's very funny.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this movie, but I also thought it was awful. It is definitely not a comedy, not for it's gags, not because of its low budget or silly characters. This movie is a mess.  It is a comedy about a loser, one, who has a dream to make the biggest movie of all time called "Dawn of the Dead". A group of friends and colleagues get him all the necessary people from his town and his family, a friend is hired to play the role of a zombie that eats the brains of people. This idea is really bad, because its basically a comedy of an idiot.   I wish this movie had been made in the 80's when movies of this type were made. But even in the mid-90's we were still in the dark ages of comedy filmmaking.
